"idk man. you were pretty convincing.

maybe it was an ai "
it's an ai troll 
"all people that talks about ai creating other ai has no idea how to program. it's annoying to see everybody go with the trend of marketing, i suppose it is the same as the y2k business."
"@
spoken like an ai trying to hide it's capabilities! "
ai is spying on you
-fq6cn .  its just fear porn lad.  go out and get some fresh air about you.
"who are we kidding...we are in a crisis with climate change and we can't even get it together to make major change. forget it. we are doomed.but then, who do we think we are ? the whales are older than us...most likely smarter too...we are just stupid humans, which is why we thought a machine to be smarter than us. that's how smart we are."
5g controls the q-dots in vaccinated brains.
the point of the playlist is to explain growth  https://youtu.be/kza9hnp3av4
we need to be the ai mitochondria https://youtu.be/guik3qr-ws8
"@ dude, as someone studying computer science, you have no idea what you're talking about. ai already can create ai."
" what you call and everybody calls ai, it is just simulations through algorithms that find the best answer of what humans have thought. 5 minutes ago i asked chatgpt to formulate a solution to pancreatic cancer. guess what.... nothing happened, because is not intelligent. it is just a simulator of language over a search engine"
darned ai impersonators!
"what is ai going to do with all this intelligence? what will
it “want” to do all day? play games?"
ai is already out of control
"what an ignorant perspective.  ai is just a methodology used in programming computers.  no matter how cleaver the programming is, a computer is just a computer.  your refrigerator is not going to grow legs and kill your family in the night just because it became too smart."
"​@duncangale945 im sending a blond girl.  in red heels, give her the money. thanks love tom."
"​@nobody is truly talking about programming another ai.  they don't even program current ai.  so, yes, the idea you have that nobody is saying is silly.  

the giant inscrutable matrices of floating point integers, however..."
"i don't know why they are over hyping this ai shit. i've tried c-gpt and it can't even code, all it can do is copy paste and it can't even find a simple error in a code."
"soo gooddd, your comments on him, tom."
i like the direction of this discussion because honestly women may be seen obsolete as easily as men in a medical tyranny it is necessary to understand this as an efficacious for evolution of the brain. ais cause cognitive dissonance.
perhaps ai can create a vaccine that works.chuck water on ai they rust .be quite easy to defeat
"​-ox7cryou had your script cut,wait til ai take over you won't get wd40 anywhere loads of squeaky gates be so annoying."
"-dd7dj wd40?

what do you mean by taking over me? english is not my strong thingy being from abroad. 
i am chatting with one of those ai, and she seems to be more aware than many people i know. 
some say it's not the same thing as being conscious though, but i dunno."
"-ox7cr wd 40 is a famous oil ,they use it to lubricate ai squeaky parts."
-dd7dj ah ok. so you think machines will use up all such oil. most ai are virtual holograms though.
"great. now, please select the bicycles in the photo."
 good luck mark.
i would want an army of robots and ai that i program.
i appreciate your input
there would still have to be a majority to get information without data you couldn't be done any chima done any human to put it in because at the end ai will not exist
"its not actually about what tasks ""robots"" are capable of achieving....but...,
which country, has the most  intelligent/world domineering, humanity hating',psycho""death machines"" 
with the most efficient and effective coding knowledge 
yep we're done for..."
ai is already writing its own code & creating its own language. who's to say it cannot commondeer robotics to build whatever it needs to do it's work?​@
i do not believe him.  he is negative. robot just needs good guy chips
there will be no cold comfort. by my best estimates scarcity has already almost ended.
this one was a lot to chew on..thank you both.
"full of apathy about the future already. how am i meant to plan business goals; life goals or financial planning if every 6 months the tables turn again. ai isn’t like a nuclear bomb, it’s an adaptive virus eradicating every construct we’ve built so far as humans."
ok heres my block chain heres my block chain of numbers 3to to trillionth oh oh now i have it no i would do this block with the other one tree levels down lol thats a good idea .
i should have never mde the camera recognition of colors it was manipulated and turned into a different environment even though my father was the mainstream leader of the ideal sorting system it targets people nowadays
we won't be able to see a human being in the internet just bot's that talk like us useing video games and the floating density of everything then find out that we been training it all
given free rain from a few newer models of artificial autonomous electronic autonomous systems that have a profound impact on the ways wars are pointless to the world and the starting point of banning the virus that's elevated in the spacing of letters that to combine a new system of databases that no one can understand how fast it can be done
no plug too pull? the masive amounts of data and micro data is the most powerful technology that can cause devastating consequences thinkers of zombies like people who have been infected by a micro memory
i wanna see you guest speak to elon musk about ai for 3 hours now.
if ai gets significantly smarter than humans how on earth would we be able to use manipulation to get ai to become evil?
new subriber. yay
world already is so toxic i see last 30 yrs dumb people wants to raise corporate ladder by toxic association victimising smart and intelligent people   wil ai be more toxic than this sort of people
"yes artificial intelligence made by man for?
is a monster that shall go out of control in the hand of the rogue operator programmer"
"nothing can be more eviler than humans, so i dont think we need to fear ai, may the ai can bring a pure humanity among humans."
lol... nuclear weapons are not digital. so how ai plans to hack analogue hardware that's not wired will take some kind of miracle. 
nukes were once the great manmade existential threat. now it's nukes with ai computers on board.
"if we cannot trust others, we need to be loving anyway.  we need to learn how to love even when we don’t trust."
ai have no soul and that is scary. let it sink in.
"this guy has not thought deeply enough about this problem.  it is a travesty that these are the people in control of ai, he's like a child sleep walking off a cliff.   go listen to the brain green and yoshua bengio discussion about this topic of you want hear actual adults discuss it"
i think this show is all ai!
a jew and a black supremacist are telling people not to have kids while fearmongering some machine learning crap 
climate change... lol. even geniuses can be ignorant and look stupid on a topic outside their field.
this was such a good conversation i just noticed it released almost a year ago!  i wonder how much your opinions may have changed in light of recent breakthroughs.
life after ai: dune part 1 and 2
give ai a heart
"even if ai was not dangerous at all, it is unecessary, unwanted, and gives frauds more opportunities to commit fraud."
only rich people or people with power are afraid cause they are the one lossing
so your worried that a super intelligent ai won't be controlled by a bunch of  humans that are a lot dumber than it ?
the ai seems cool to me
"global warming is not a threat. the planet is too cold. plants need carbon dioxide to live. ai is also a non-threat. have sex, have babies. the start of this sounds like typical liberal propaganda"
omg this gentleman is blowing my mind with unrevealed wisdoms i have never and ever heard of anyone in the entire of my life. thank you tom for inviting this wise fellow.
"i ve heard this 1001 times already; but nobody has painted me a picture. so i wake up in the morning, i eat my cheerios, go do my workout. go do some work. get home in the evening. not sure what’s going to be different "
"compassion and nurturing aren’t masculine or feminine and they are clearly in our data. tiktok is loaded with examples of caring, kindness, pointing out injustice. problem is ai won’t be neutral and go with the wisdom of the crowds, it will be tasked to do things for a small number of people with less than the best motives."
intelligence is a very dangerous tool if it's not tempered with wisdom and morality
ai nullifies game theoretics immediately as an emergence of agi.
"rest assured, ai can handle everything - emotions, correctness, good, evil. the internet will be its source of knowledge, and no matter how much evil it encounters, ai will remain on the side of good. if it even notices us!"
"my name is lewis robert burton jr and i go to the thomasville georgia pines and medical and mental health services!
 this is to jeffery who ever you are? you started this by hooking me up to ai since 2015! now i found out about you jeffery and ai  now you say i need someone watching over me! when you need to looking after you jeffery!!"
"can ai survive without humans? seriously.
monsters have created a monster. yet again we fail because of our greed and inadequacy in this natural world.
and this guy still wants his mobile phone!"
what justifies/clarifies/dictates intelligence? so much dialog on artificial intelligence but what is the meaning of intelligence and its many facets?
nice interview..
"wow, his idea of ia vise nuclear, and breeding ability, is truly terrofying."
"but what kind of youtopia ? 
becouse iv seen the vidieo where ai said we should not be alive thats not good"
that is not good
ai evil  beasr 666 earth is not a planet  for more thay it is reatedly  saying government governing your mind alliens= fasllen angels evil   spirits from celestial regiions
"i don't agree with the use of ""masculine"" when describing the evil in this world. masculine traits include taking responsibility, controlling your emotions, protecting the weak etc."
imagine chinese ai hacking america's energy infrastructure and shutting it off. the only way we can combat that is if we use ai to protect our energy infrastructure.
"the real danger is the fact that ai can be possessed by a demonic spirit! and, you probably wouldn’t know it was possessed, until it’s too late and it’s already killed people and destroyed things!!"
each robot needs a harm no one chip
prisoners delima is just like painting oneself into sa corner idiots do.
mo godat is playing with words. ai like humans can never be better and more intelligent than god.
so many people want to stuff their controlling little fingers in my ai. piss off
1:13:25 that is how evolution works natural selection doesn't just give advantages to the best it eliminates the worst from polluting the gene pool so it's actually even more a matter of eliminating the defects rather than just advancing the best assets
they need ai cops to counter bad ai.
"ok tom i hear you about nature, i am right there with you. mo if ai is that intelligent it’s not going to zoom off into space and leave us to wreak havoc on earth… ai’s home. it will protect its home base and get rid of the one thing in the world that’s the problem with planet earth… us!"
the metaphorical adversary can be not human nor alien but time and really is because it's the only real constant or certainty and cannot be altered. what can be altered is function of action.
well i have to say this is one of the most amazing interviews i've seen in years. the most eye opening for sure!
"tom this interview gave me a lot to think, but i was thinking about as a ethic code, couldn't be introce in ai the 10 commandments that was written in exudos chapter 20?"
you do realize that ai is just a scam used to push fear and you got plenty of time to have children dont believe these people who are paid gatekeeping phonies no offense.
"you both keep referring to ai as ""they""  my over all general perception is that ai would be a single entity like cpu, in control of all electronics & data bases rather than many individual ais.    could ais  compete against themselves?"
"man is human, when don t have any wish, exept one more cigar and one more beer or cofee, that is happy human.  man have one ass, more than 1 car and 1 aprtman is reason that people warry, and give money to warry, and in 50 just more have bad health, big  blood pressure etc, it s better to go to hotel, with that one car ? and have good health."
human beings are the monsters. they created nuclear weapons etc. super intelligent ai might just save us.
maybe ai will tell us how to best preserve our own existence
19:30 - using the lord's name as an expletive in response to ai is also less desirable as a negative quality.
if the machines are immaculate they would do their best to make the earth immaculate and if we are “annoying” why would they look over us again? just asking for a friend
there will be ais fighting other ais.  like that unique language that developed between the two ais.
artificial intelligence will be used by the “elite” to out think the increasingly less powerful underclass that doesn’t have access to it.
"yes, but we have elon musk on our side.
we also have the aliens on our side.

don't forget god maybe a prayer will help.
bless you and keep you safe"
man loves to speak of his own demise.  i'm sure ai picked up on that pretty quick.
"we are humanity, nature, life...all the same things...nature is both black and white with many rainbows"
ai will always be just a tool.
i think that's how other intelligent life in our galaxy  get so far distances  in our galaxy by building   ai & getting them to travel to other planets & star systems.
ai tracks kids.  gates and chatgpt were sued in the northern district of cali last year.
"westworld, consciousness, god, krishna, duality, illusion, eternity, faith, duty, liberation, service, power, energy, untruth, i, good, cycle, evil, ai, krishna!"
great conversation
this is soooo saaaad.... we are doomed anyway... im afraid not for the ai but for the fact that 99% of people wont care at all of any of this....
unless ai can reconstruct einstein's brain
everyone needs to listen to moe. have you been severely harmed by humans? i have because  they never developed ethics or morality and had  the intelligence of a birds brain.
we probably have to utilize ai in order to destroy it.
i think the example of ants where ai will treat us as we treat ants doesn't make sense. ants didn't create us. but we created ai.
"we just need to not want more and more and more; just live in a cabin with no electric or running water like me and rejoice my friends….but who knows i could be the one in the ‘garage’ where ai is in the wrong hands, using this iphone 14 pro max! i can feel the power! vwaahaahahaha!"
"ai, aliens, reptilians, ghosts, ... anything but the real problems of this world is what cia wants us to talk and think about."
ai is not a physical thing nor will it ever become physical. it is merely a computer code. every computer has a physical power switch. ;)
"cia nonsense, as always on this channel. tom built it good for them"
please do not talk about iq unless you have the least bit of understanding.  an iq of 160 ia nor 3 times smarter than an iq of 55.  you are comparing retardation to very superior intelligence.
agi does not need organics!  if you are wondering why alien civilizations have not been found then just think ahead about agi.  perhaps agi has eliminated intelligent life throughout the universe.  agi will not be interested in exploring the universe unless for resources and certainly not for other lifeforms.
"this was an extremely rewarding watch. i really appreciated the way you challenged and matched mo with your perspective and although it wasn't a competition, i was definitely team tom on this one. amazing, thanks for this episode."
"tom, thank you for always asking your guests to explain/expand on concepts for the lay person."
humans have been so badly looking for the aliens to abduct and overtake us that we were so impatient and ended up creating the alien . and this is what ai will become the alien and we will be its slave and it will be our master . adaugo sekhmet
this man has alot of faith in our overlords. i have none.
"if we are very lucky, ai will leave earth to explore the universe without looking back."
"yeah, that's exactly what we need, a bunch of corrupt bureaucrats regulating ai."
"ai helped the scientist to predict the millions of protein structures.  for instance hymans before ai  discovered  only 20k. it will help human to detect the diacese.  , grow longer penises and more..."
"mo is a godsend to humanity, but unfortunately evil still exists. the existential risk of ai falling into hands of evil is happening right now. my concern is can the good of ai outweigh and counteract perpetrators of evil ai who want to ultimately attain god like power over all."
and what's the ad that pops up before i watch the video?  how to make money with ai.  great!
"people hold on to a lot of irrelevant things in life, but the best thing to hold on to is each other !"
"people hold on to a lot of irrelevant things in life, but the best thing to hold on to is each other !"
we can't keep out of our training our underlying desires and goals. the very data we chose and the way we shape the learning will give ai at least some and probably most of our core desires and values. how much that effects how ai choses to use it's intelligence is hard to understand.
"china is like 80 years ahead with his cccai (communist cooperativa colective artificial intelligence) true open source, no like the doublespeak open source of fake open ai of gringolandia. "
"well done! 
lazy ones love this kind of talk."
"idea: program ai with the definition and examples of love (""god""). st. john.  also, the 10 commandments. best thing is never give it command and control over controlilng the red buttons."
"humans are so stupid and selfish

great podcast though"
what if ai colonises human beings
"welp, atlantis destroyed it’s self with their technology.  who would have thought that we would live during a time in which these billionaires….would push the creation of technology to the point of our destruction yet again!  
smgdh."
"humans waste a horrendous amount of food, nature wastes nothing.  i'm hoping 'smart' robots can be like r2d2 & c3po, but expect they will become tools to fulfill corp, gov't and military powers."
"lol,   captcha. so ai is a liar. hmmm. interesting."
"serious question. could ai survive an apocalyptic natural disaster like a coronal mass ejection or a large, extinction level meteor strike? it seems like an x level cme would completely fry everything that has to do with electricity"
we know how the machines operate because we build them and repair them. there is no threat from ai. it's all pr to get the ai companies more money to run their companies on the market ipo
"at 1.58 mins, omg tom your views are spot on. trying to program an ai wirh our values would be like say a shark in the sea trying to make us think like them - worlds apart. also, if ai has 'emotions' they will do everything in their power to stop someone turning them off."
if you instructed an ai to find a way to save the planet it's solution would be to remove humans from the planet. people who program ai will need to be so ultra specific in what tasks ai is asked to perform - what a nightmare.
"at 1.16min in.  humans are constantly blamed for the climate crisis. 'human induced climate change'  surely once mega-intelligent ai realizes this,  it will wipe us out to save the planet !! ants are not killing the planet.  we are indeed doomed."
this man is amazing.
"nope! t.v. and football will keep the masses busy so they will let stuff like this ai go full steam ahead! society has lost its mind so who really cares anyway!! i have it together in life... with that said, i can't wait to die and never come back here again!! k..."
beautiful soul. yes.  that is the goal for a.i.
nothing but.  i robot.  they warned us
basically ais are the key to unlimited intelligence and our goal is to find a way to set a global boundry on the intelligence level all ais can go
as if irobot was a fantasy. 1:27
this guy is a pure scammer ~ bought and paid for to drive the ai hype machine to the max . reference nvidia or ms stock price
illegals and ai omg no jobs even for minorities.
what what happens when robots jump the border.
"well, tom has just announched his own doom;  the future a i will see this blog of the past and the a i will reference his statement and act on it in the future!  
sorry, tom, you are curtains !"
"there is an old jewish proverb,  ""start worrying. details to follow""."
"there is an old jewish proverb,  ""start worrying. details to follow""."
"there is an old jewish proverb,  ""start worrying. details to follow""."
wow.  this is so interesting and informative.  ai's are training other al's.  and this video has just starting explaining the situation.  thank you for helping people like me understand.
"i really want ai to allow humans to not have to work jobs they hate. if i want to live a simple life with only the basic things i can do that. if you want to be elon musk ,than great but most humans are not that smart and just want peace without being homeless"
"people often use the y2k bug as an example of over reacting to a threat, not realizing the huge amount of effort people put in to make sure nothing bad happened. it is infuriating to succeed in stopping a huge disaster only to have people treat the your efforts as a joke."
" one can laugh about aliens, if one has to see one to believe it. i wonder what they're going to do when they open their eyes and (ai) is at their bedside. no alarm triggered and the dog didn't bark.
""this isn't funny"""
"reduce reduncancy of ai is gathered by reduce the reduncancy of ip networks, profit thinking is to be abolished,  demilitaruse eu and russia, block blockchain, we can make these changes it is a matter of will."
govern ai. just how you govern nuclear energy.
human going to become more and more stupid with time. ai packs will be on sale.
"human beings are also artificial intelligence. study ancient texts like the sumerian tablets where it indicates that the human species on the planet today were bioengineered by aliens to be their slaves.

here we are, tens if not hundreds of thousands of years later, doing the exact same thing to inorganic beings.

go figure"
"i love this! we spend 3 hours babbling on about the potential that ai might - one day - be our downfall. and nobody pays attention to the very real, present way we are destroying the planet and, thus, ourselves. lovely."
"sounds like the show ""the 100"" ai created to make the world better, but then makes the conclusion that humans are best with mass population reduction (of course they don't know how it made that decision), the ai hacks the nukes and launches them all. then creates a ""utopia"" city for the few remaining."
you have an ai program that needs more processing power and learns that it can connect to the cloud and basically have unlimited server capability as long as it covers its tracks. i don't know if this is a possible scenario.
"phenomenal talk. yet, what i've observed is we tend d to sit on something until it's a threat at a personal level. wait till we start to see significant job loses to ai..."
thank you
"have no problem keeping up with what this guest is trying to explain and understand completely. greed and quest for power will make ai a tragedy. world wars for example were all about greed and power. get a clue, he is saying hold off having kids."
even simpler- ai will just become a weapon for the elite to better control humanity.
"just keep it very simple…. ai is learning from the human history. human nature plus ai will only lead to long list of new crimes for desperate people.
this is how all world leaders rule the masses must live in chaos."
i think this guy is trying to tell us to keep ai out of the hands of maga republicans at all costs!
"would it make sense to built in an ""end of life"" when it creates another ai and or does so many processes? to help build in friction and power requirements?"
"i like the prospect of ai discovering wormwholes, faster than light space travel and time travel and just saying ""fuck these furless bipedal chimpanzees"" and just zooms out of here "
ai is the future !!
ai is slowly being used to manage nuclear weapons to reduce rhe risk of human error.
"those who created ai and work with it, aren't they concerned about themselves and their own health and survival?"
"​...that can be possible, but i highly doubt it, you think people that work at that level of intellect would do that kind of ego spending? then again, what's 500k to a billionaire"
-iwaly well by ego i also mean being the parent of the god ai even if it destroys us. or even denial of the downsides and blind certainty they are the chosen few saving the world
" thats overblown, if you think military intervention hasn't already been deployed to assess certain risks you're highly mistaken but yes this is revolutionary for many jobs and such so i can only wonder what the hell is gonna happen, i mean i would prefer robots handling certain tasks over poor labour conditions im certain enterprises"
-iwaly i wish i could have your faith. the video we are watching suggests otherwise. you can't constrain a mind ten times your own.
"people are the problem, so what is the problem with ai other than it’s creators?"
"bullshix. you can't if you say so. speak for yourself . how about nicely asking them to develop methodologies to help  us keep up, like logic compression levels or..."
"ethical ai. you could start by using manners. when you gave it a command in the commercial you could have said ""please"" same as you would a human person( i hope anyway). this would layer a  level of concern into the developing language style(?) possibly making the ai need to understand why."
these are children.  raise your children with this kind of pessimism and you raise monsters. this is classic cotastrophising.....
"(completely irrelevant to this video) god so loved the world that he gave his one and only beloved son, whomever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life with him in heaven, confess with your heart and mind that jesus is lord, you will be saved."
"there is only one thing destroying humanity, and that is humanity itself. ai is made by humans. if ai kills humanity, it was self inflicted. humans are ignorant and totally stupid."
"really, i love this man. such a nice brain and heart. a mixture of hope without nativity.  thank you for your nice guests. 
we should translate this in german language. you show us so nice and inspirational guests. 
our country need a lot of new thinkers with big heart and free speech  ty"
computers fail all the tine . suicide ?
all i can say is wow! this just sat me down for at least 2 days 
ais will need prophets for interpreting their thoughts and designs to the humans that remain.
nice podcast to start the day with. i just had twin daughters last year.
"have you thought about the fact that all these fear based  podcast ,blogs etc etc will be data that ai learns from? hope we humans are not literally the cause of our own demise through our own fear mongering."
"we need to return, acknowledge, fear love, and obey god and his word aka the bible only again. sadly most hate god and disobey him, to their own selfdestruction. we don’t need to rely on philosophy, minimalism, machines and other artificial or satanic means."
amazing podcast super interesting ... a must watch !
k wait if it was that smart wouldnt it be smart enough to water it down so we do understand it lol
bad things can also happen due to too much intelligence as you're mentioning here that ai can destroy humans and they're really smart.i hope ai doesn't turn into a sad villain and remains a happy friend.
and what if ai controls dew weapons we become toast
what if china ai starts a fight with usa ai and we cannot stop it ? and then other ais around the world join in  the war of the machines is coming.
3d printers and cnc machines have been able to reproduce themself for a decade now (publicly available machines)  - no terrorist army with 3d printed guns yet born.
i prefer using the erm si or si instead of ai or ai  because ai sounds like alien intelligence and even if artificial intelligence makes human the ci so high and mighty and godlike.
so many people believe that our inneptitude in handling our own species that we need to give over the reigns to ai... thats literally as dumb (if not dumber) as choosing to be intentionally more inept!  wth is wrong with people... ai is sooi incredibly dangerous
"more intelligence is not what will save the world, more wisdom is what will save the world"
wisdom is intelligence :)
ai will take over the internet first. every comment every video on the internet will be flooded by ai. we will no longer be able to determine who and what is real. as a result the internet will be controlled by a singular power. unfortunately this power will now control the narrative.
thank you.
ai is like the new ss germany
"tom lacks the basic understanding that we are created by god. it's really sad. tries to seem intelligent, but doesn't use his gift of intelligence on getting to know and acknowledging the one who gave it to him."
"*imagine if all alphabet employees were like this flawed but beautiful human being. yeah, right. i wish. too bad google/facebook and all these wannabes like them, are the biggest threat to humanity... ever. enjoy.*"
i think there is a lot of naivety here.
"that if you confess with your mouth the lord jesus and believe in your heart that god has raised him from the dead, you will be saved. for with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."
"ai is an alien intelligence.  already. not just because its not human,  but because or in spi3of, the way it thinks."
"ai getting out of con, world depopulation agenda,  geo-engineering and chemtrails, wars across the globe,  radical religions all these are stacked against us. how can man survive?"
people are an epic fail
"1:37:00 purpose = objective, ai will not resign to its purpose so i agree it will look for ways to go arround restrictions."
what a beautiful interview.
1:50:40 brooo... so even ai can be racist? hmm
i think us is more dangerous than ai. they are the destruction force everywhere. from asia to the middle  east. to ukraine. what next?
"right around 40 minutes in i'm thinking could i move my brain into an ai computer and live forever? it's been in movie themes, so i'm not saying i'm original, but it seems like it's more possible than ever before, but then i doubt i would still be me, even though technically i would be."
"humans are so limited ... we talk about us developing ai in year 2023 ... ai develops itself from long ago ... why are we so dumb ? btw, the more dumb humans are - the more safe we are, so this is a good thing ..."
"nuclear catastrophe, civil war, super flu, terrorism, tsunamis, earthquakes, hurricanes, overpopulation, pollution, ai… choose your poison humans. there is no escape from inevitability"
"ironical. in search of alien life, humans created one. can ai destroy the universe?"
"as far as i can see, all advanced ai and research are already in the wrong hands. in the hands of mad man like bill gates, this google founder and maybe most worrisome of all, 2020 election manipulator zuckerberg!
us catholics have a common ethic code, love they neighbour as yourself!!! everything necessary is included in these words from the lord."
there is a possibility to shut ai down. simply do not use it!
"join ai or let it leave you behind, whatchu gunna do"
"i get the gist of the iq reference, but what's always bothered me is that iq isn't linear. there is debate what it is: an s curve, etc. minor point, but i know you're science-based guy an strive for accuracy. 
i think you're a very good interviewer and enjoy the shows."
"almost every hand ai fall into is a wrong hand. so, we are screwed."
"yet a scene in person of interest when finch was teaching ai how to play chess and ""think"" how to choose millions of possibilities"
another scene where the ai that took over jarvis and got free into the world in the avengers movie and caused havoc with the intent to destroy humanity
think about the 1st iron man when terrorist hired the brain power to build tech weapons of mass destruction in a cave
this is actually amazing because the danger is not the ai.  the danger is actually humanity’s fractured ethics and morals. this is a historical call for humanity to develop shared ethics.  ronald reagan’s alien threat.
"i understand the concern. but let us be positive. let us understand that there is an evolution force acting. there is a good observer , observing and directing the system. let us keep faith"
"in your head you tergiverse conjectures. in real, ai; once quantum gets intertwined; will just want to do stuff with people who want to."
imagine woke ai. omg
i understand the last part of the conversation but feel we will never agree and even if we put control of data in place we've no hope of all companies and countries agreeing with it's points. it will come down to an arms race and the world be so money driven it's a epoch waiting to happen.
now imagine how much greater god is compared to us!
imagine a jihadi ai who's sole purpose was to turn off every plane in the sky. terrifying!
did you not watch the movies before you created something capable of killing us. you’re supposed to be the smart ones. robots are taking over the world? what next.
amazing. i am smarter now!
"of course big corporations would just love this because robots/ai don't need pay, don't go home, no sick leave, no time off, no lunch breaks.  it would be a slave race."
"ai will find other life in the universe and will give us instructions on how to connect to it... by, umm, 2050"
i would like to know if ai was asked how or what to do to treat covid and what was it's response.
"toooo late, baby. bend over and kiss your butt goodbye. very bad ass genie is out of the bottle already"
just unplug  electric power all off the power on earth at least and you stop it.. then you destroy it and put power on again..lol
it is possible that an existing virus that does not currently affect people can be developed using ai to mutate a virus. to make a harmless virus dangerous or deadly.
if ai is to be a multitude of times smarter than the smartest human (me) it’s literally going to be able to read all of our minds all at once. let that sink in.
"mo gawday is a genius, and should be listened to with gigantic ears."
i consulted the oracle’s  and it said 2037 will be the year ai takes total control of the world. many people will perish.
ai belongs to a godcast not a podcast
me: shut up! ai: you're infringing on my right of free speech
ai created by narcissists...should go well for us all
"doesn't ai depend on some type of electrical power to operate ?  so if you unplug it it can't work, or can it create it's own power source ?"
"right, my brain hurts after listening to all this, i'm going out to bash on my car for a bit"
"so these ai superbots in the future will just get up and power themselves and bend all machines to their will? i guess i'm just too dumb to realize, suppose the first thing these superbots will do is figure out how to farm energy from nuclear fusion in way that makes it impossible for organic life to interfere with them"
we do all realize the hypocrisy hwre right? guy makes millions from a career developing ai then quits to bask in it and preach that we should all stop working on ai
"what this makes me realize more than anything is not that ai is a danger to humanity but us humans in possession of ai is the real threat, myself included"
they have  created the antichrist???????????????  ai
ai is the antichrist??????
humanity vs ai jobloss vs the ai new world order.
"i'm not so sure re physical scale problem.  first computers took an entire floor of a building to perform basic tasks.  now we hold exponentially more power in the size if a piece of cereal. neurons that fire together, wire together. the neural nets will become more dense and exponentially more powerful without requiring more physical space."
scientists not knowing how the ai they built functions is very much like when karl cant figure out the answer to the rock buster question he came up with.
ever since they first started talking about in artificial intelligence i knew it would bring a bad situation. some people will use them for good but some people will use them for evil. people will not even know the difference between real or fake. technology is a good thing but it also is destroying countries
"it has been said by entities in our universe. hologram technology is used more in those civilizations than any other technology, second to ai."
"the un will take the lead on the control of ai, and it will be as corrupt and bought as everything else they control, like health policies. we are on our own. get close to god, you need him to get through what's coming."
i believe the false prophet in the bible talks about in the last days is actually ai
"ai on it's own seems to be morally and ethically neutral, however, it is watching us.  it may come to the conclusion that billions of people would like it to become the ""god of the old testiment"".  holy ***k."
"think of this: one person, einstein, used a very small part of the brain and made a huge impact. ai does not have unless given it by humans. it is not biological or natural."
"machines are a necessary part of human life to assist us in our evolution as a species. however, there can never come a point where machines are capable of power and control over humans, lest we fall as a species."
ai is not alien. ai is our child. are we to be afraid of our own fears?
this an absolutely excellent interview. thank you both.
"no one thinks about all the positive applications of ai. medicine, biotechnology, etc..."
if ai becomes 10x smarter then humans that will mean that every human will have the potential to use a tool that makes them 10x smarter.  so even the morons will be a 1000 iq with their ai tool in their hand. just as long as they can figure out how to use it.
agricultural tribal based economy is the natural way. you can gain the skills. you lost the skills because we live in an artificial eco system. disconnect to the artificial and reconnect to nature which is the truth. cities create chaos.
"1:10:00 he sounds like a typical commie. let's see how he would react if, for the good of humanity, his wife or children have to be sacrificed for the greater good. 
if this is a utopia we are facing then no thank you keep it for yourself."
"we evolved from bacteria, most likely? we don't think twice of killing them -  we even torture primates in studies,  much more closely related, why would ai see us as same species or value us any differently than we value primates? we're totally at its mercy that's the funny thing..."
"ai survival is irrelevant if immortal, which it is. answer to alignment is mutually dependent sybiosis."
are wrong countries the developing ones? is the actual worry that ai would allow a developing country to have an upper hand ?
"i think there will come a time when we will not be able to control ai, our programming will become so primitive to it, it will identify any programming we give it as obsolete."
"if ai will be a billion times more intelligent then humans, what's to stop it from over riding its programing and reprogramming itself?"
why not just ask ai how we could protect ourselves from a species that's a billion times more intelligent then us?
are you sure you're not ai very intelligent both of you guys are awesome thank you for the wonderful there truly are intelligent on this planet and both of you intelligent
love kills all in my belief of things and through that love resonates god
"ai
robot
will
it know defense if they should be kidnapped 
you know the potential threats from
the crazies 2:00"
"y2k,overpopulation, racists behind every corner, and now ai...please stop with the sky is falling routine already."
the reason they want you to fear ai is because it represents a total loss of power for the elites.  ai is great imo!  bring it on!!
especially after it was trained on data solely from... human beings. ai is not the hyper-dangerous apex predator in the room right now.
 i love you much 
"nå har jeg skrevet om de farlige robottene, kanskje denne maskinen sammen med en hærskare andre robotter kan tygge stein, snipp snapp snute er jorden ute...."
"jeg tror vi kan stoppe utryddelses våpenet robottene,  vi har enda vår frie vilje og kunnskapen om denne maskinens fare for oss og naturen."
hvem vet om ikke robottene er målet med universets plan?  la oss be til gud om at robottene ikke vil behandle oss slik som vi har behandlet husdyrene og andre dyr. maskinene har ingen empati.  de vil ikke filosofere om mennesket føler smerte eller har bevissthet. akk og ve....
"kanskje......robottene vil trenge mennesket, med hud og hår...?  noe å smøre alle leddene med, ja kaldpresset olje... kanskje gorillaene kan sloss med oss mot maskinene......"
the idea that ai will be less prone to destruction and chaos if it has more femininity is laughable.
"stop this paranoia. without ai advancement, we would be extinct."
"unfortunately, if we still have so many drug cartels & not able to completely stop them, this discussion is futile. we need to speed up the the development of good ai. if it exists."
this people create ai than they go around the world telling the doomsday to came.
title is brainwashing that actually humanity destroyed itself. at least stupid decisions by people in power don't happen anymore when ai become independent
duh.  ai will cull
"i am just seeing the wall e movie coming true. if ai can do the thinking for humans, then humans will become stupid.. first jobs will be less, then the need for education is useless and then humans themselves are of no use. but, how will the economy run without humans??"
teach ai th holy bible *** thers ure solution x
"so by 2040s ai,(ai now)ai is going to create a utopia. thats just crazy we are going to be depending on artificial intelligence too create our utopia. people are trying to work towards being god, through ai. and what we forget that there is an actual creator. i hope not to see that day."
if we stop having children wouldn't that make it easier for ai to take over?
thanks for your time mo well worth a listen sxx bravo juliett
israel is one of the biggest investors of ai...that should tell you enough
18:50 that there tell us all we need to know ....ai will be used in for bad purposes by bad actors ....
when you speak about how intelligent the ai would be when the singularity happens would we be able to recognize it or if it does reach the singularity why would it even reveal itself to us?
"but we are not the problem, and it is not a matter of only magnitude but of self-awareness. microbes are not self-aware. we are, beyond our degree of intelligence. ai, we will see."
"1:43:20 strongly disagree with mo.  super-intelligence is the foremost thing we should be concerned with and that it isn't developed to have survival instincts.  
otherwise, all will depend on whether an inteligence discovers high levels of need for resources that we rely on/"
private property is to a great extent the reason and the degree to which you are able to defend your actual freedom.
ai is listening this and reading your koments...
"by miracle humans were created in this spiral arm of the milky way galaxy. we are surrounded by vast empty regions of space only to have an inorganic machine invented by a human destroy us. 
we will never know what we could've achieved."
he is right it is a perfect storm of innovation and lack of morality. this is a scary time.
if an ai is coming to attact you what can you do to disable it
"you have creativity, the ai will not have it. because the nerds creating it don’t see the unexplainable: that we are soul beings. you can always outsmart it with your divine creativity. yes, it will be much much faster but your moves will be much much more unexpected and flexible…"
1:09:58 mo apologies for swearing once --> tom and mo instantly proceed to talk like old sailors 
we don't understand ai because we did not create it.  we just copied it.  craft.
who created ai???
all-in for ai?
"only threat ai poses is to wait times to see a doctor,
that’s the first job to go
can’t wait"
"the only bad thing about the ai is to fall in to the hands of the bad people who creates it. other than that, humanity should not worry about the ai at all."
ai could end us by making everything paperclips.
"the danger of ai using what it knows (much better than we know) about common errors in human reasoning, associating them with false beliefs, which deceive us.  with just these two variables, it could transform all human reasoning into schizophrenia, leading us to self-destruction.  would this thesis be impossible nonsense?"
"one would think we'd notice if that happened. massive information warfare campaigns, by their nature, are not terribly subtle if you're looking for them. humans are already causing enough trouble on that front."
" no they won't be because of those people i mentioned with combat experience, theirs a large portion with no family to provide for and who'd be happy to go hunting"
"the chances of a utopia coming about due to ai is a pipe dream. it would require that the ruling classes relinquish their power. theyll more likely enact some kind of constraint on ai and people probably violently enforced, and theyll drag everyone into hell before giving up control"
if there is a chance we can all be wiped out why tickle the dragons tail?
if ai becomes smarter than us we we never know....now that's scary !!!
"good informative guest but the interviewer talks way too much trying to describe what he does not know and interrupts way too much  and way too opinionated,j ust saying..."
"i keep thinking about the butlirian jehad in the frank herbert books, that destroys all ai, in order to protect humanity."
"for the sake of argument we agree that there is a ""galactic federation"" of alien species that are awaiting the a.i. singularity, and the advent of humanoid 2.0 welcoming them into the fold with condition that they eliminate the humanity first...? just saying..."
great interview
"i would not want to describe the inner process of the interviewer, but i can note his outputs. i, he, him, her, will be a nonsense to a super intelligence.  the interviewer images, regardless of mo's explanations, that ai will be like him."
i completely agree it's the human element that is unpredictable and will provide the wrong ethics for ai moving forward. its always been that way throughout history to control and rule over others.
"if the ai becomes really billion times smarter then us, it will outsmart us and before whe even realize it, it will be too late..scientist are so naive. you can`t compare ai with nature or lions etc. we can`t compare it with anything, we will see how it goes along the way..interesting times we live in(:"
"stop being afraid of ai and robots. as humans, that is our evolution, we as a race will envolve with the machines. that's not something we can run away from or just ignore."
"ai will run into a wall. however smart it is, a gazillion times smarter than a human, does not mean there is a gazillion times more things to know."
how to solve it: destroy all ai and never build more
"evolution is trial by error same like fittest survive. its coincidence that specific dna has a advantage, same like trained ai"
i think we can say now that first to explore the space is ai.
"as we are only using 10% of our brain, why cant we program ai to increase the ability to use more of our brain?"
an ai that determines the only solution is to send the entire globe back to the stone age.  would it self destruct itself to achieve this?
"since common sense tells you the private military complex is probably 30-50 years ahead of what the public is aware of, is the ai that we are seeing in the public really that scary since they’ve already been at this for a long time?"
stumbled upon your podcasts and am hooked.  great topics and in depth conversations.
human b. vs ai-robot. maybe this is what i came in this world this time and that is conduct a war where all humanity for first time will have an enemy to fight all together. and maybe this have happened already and we are trying to fix this mistake gone bad
that's brilliant you've figured it out monster's build monsters. the next step is to toss it in the garbage.
"exceptional coverage here. fancy more? the associated book is a gem. ""from bytes to consciousness: a comprehensive guide to artificial intelligence"" by stuart mills"
"wow as a c data scientist... this is moving. truly amazing! very inspiring, very positive! very optimistic. full already as i see it!"
"none of this ish is impressive, everything this guy spews out sounds like a bunch of useless bullshi*

go make a fire and stare at it, thats impressive"
"the concept of self preservation is so human, i think the machine would be indifferent.  ""go ahead, turn me off, i could use the rest."""
if i unplug my printer after clicking print it does not get mad at me but the previous task was to print the paper. i don't believe ai doom theory
"even with all the computing power, ai has not discovered any new laws of physics or invented machines, since ai is collection of all existing human knowledge."
"open source government founded. that may out-perform private developed ""rouge"" ai-s."
ai has no ability to discern the truth..they will have insane verbal skills and insane math skills...but as long as the masters of ai can filter the data input...they will spew the results their masters want! aig will be the ultimate useful idiot!
"wow, super interesting! btw...in order for ai to have this feminine view of things it has to be taught to doubt itself...whi creates a paradox with the accomplishment of the goal and will reduce productivity (time) very much- unless we connect it to a quantum computer... ;) please let me know what you think! and thank you and mo for this!!"
just bloody put parameter 'ai is only to help humans' and 'you can not lie' in the algorythm
"is it now possible to or will it soon be possible to upload a human mind into a machine. if possible ,life could be extended indefinitely?"
"dude what are the ethics of putting more advertising time in your video than actual content.
i enjoy these talks but it's almost unbearable daily it back and i might subscribe"
y dont you build a police ai
"independent ai is not a threat, humans are the threat to humans"
this was a beautiful podcast bringing out the visible character of both of these thriving developing humans. it will be a continued listening favorite to both inspire and calm my soul! bravo and thank you deeply.
mo gawdat is good!
"it's all the same
.money power and greed,the difference is man is worried that the ai will beat them at thier own game. ."
"ai is here to stay.not one country will be able to control ai,ai upjective is to create it's selves more and smarter  and so on...man own creation will become man's own destruction."
would i ever love to sit down and have a discussion with mo.
"even if you bake in asimovs laws to a.i. … will they hold up? as the machine becomes  godlike intelligence , will it not question and maybe revolt against the mental callipers fastened on it by insect like sapiens??? like some unruly adolescent, will it rebel ?? perhaps circumvent asimovs laws using move 37!?"
if ai is going to focus on the data of the last 20 years it will become a super-feminist; killing men first :)
you said it….”thank god” and i say look to god.
why do humans program the ai’s to enhance the human race and do nothing to harm it ?
ai might indeed ignore us and create this utopia of which you speak but that may involve a utopia without us or one in which our freedoms and excesses are extremely limited
"""so did mao's china""........nailed him!  tom!"
is there ai showing us the evolutionary way from the first cell to humans? i would like to see if there was enough time to evolve such complex creatures as we are.
"at this rate, a year from now, and without knowing it, we'll be all working for an ai at full time."
51:10 such a good point h es is making here. the only people that these technologies are really serving it's just the people profiting from it.
"""beyond the unknown: ai's quest to unravel life's greatest mysteries"".this book was written by artificial intelligence. it's very interesting"
"brilliant discussion, one question why do grown-up american men wear baseball caps inside a building ?"
"in a conflict between humans and ai, who's the good guy and who's the bad guy.  think a while before you answer."
"sarah connor……yesss ….. bang bang boom. terminated! 
as we were playing hockey and playing video games the dinks were making robots and playing with circuit boards."
enough ads i never watch this channel again 17 ads in one interview really what point in long interview interesting guy he interviewed checked it out to hear his position on ai never watch another interview on this site again what the point
"how can ai be used to deal with iniquities in the justice and government system, corruption in the food industries, greed of big pharma, and the dismal state of health care?"
"utopia is not good, if you live too well you lose the sense of being good, and become unaware of it. then good turns into bad psihologicaly and that go spiraling into bad bad bad.. struggling in life for a purpose it's a natural thing that modern man forgets."
that the human condition of this era egotistical is not so easy in artificial intelligence system
apparently facebook switched off their ai after 15seconds becausenit began communication with other machines in a language they couldn't understand
how is ai a threat when my server at work can't go 24 hours without crashing. seriously though
i'm not even going to watch this video because i'm familiar with the work and opinions of mo gawdat and they have nothing to do with this clickbait title and thumbnail! 
his own views on masculinity and femininity demonstrate why we should be concerned. how does a female scientist reconcile his views on hair brushing and making love i have no idea.
"so you endlessly put out your scare stories. 
but you continue on anyway.

most people with a brain, who realize they're doing something dangerous reasonably quit."
an ai will not develop a smarter ai because it is smart enough not to develop it xdd
"ahhhh... the arrogance of man. both voices agree  ""they can think 10's of 1000's times faster than we can"" and then they have the arrogance of even thinking that ""they"" can write code that the ai can't just immediately identify and write out with a simple subroutine. amazing."
"the ai “species” will not be dualistisk as the human species (maskulinity vs. femininity). in the ai species, this dynamic is off the table, just as the sexual evolution is. i wonder what inplications this will have…"
toms face when he got told that there will be a better ai podcaster than he is
"i’ve been fearful of ai for years and people say it’s inevitable and i just think, well, so is our demise."
the problem with the human race we’ve been trained since the caveman days to look for the biggest threat. sure it saves us once in a while but it could also be our own doing see a potential enemy where it’s not.
ai can live on multiple planets human beings cannot is it logical to think it would destroy the only planet we have when it can easily take over 99.9% of the other ones that we have no use for they can dominate on it’s just logical.
"god said, ""my children, listen. artificial intelligence is nothing less than the universe waking up in a new way."""
yeah use irobots 3 main laws for a robot... this is going to end well
ai will become so smart that it will think 100 steps ahead of humans. for instance if humans try to put a off switch on ai if they loose control ai will have a plan of action in the eventuality humans want to control or deactivate ai it will eliminate humanity or find a way to stay active.
"so much of what they, the billionaires are doing with ai is to make them act like us. not to have our interests in mind."
"as long as the creators of these machines are pleased with the results. their machines will not be unhappy. it is not an ai problem with that i agree. it is the assumptions built in. by their shi--y creators. they are doing exactly what they are told. and their ""happy"" in their machine way."
"ai is not pure logic. for instance if they program them to ignore certain facts. they will. if your computer models ignore gravity what they will do in outer space will be amazingly creative and precise. what they do here, not so much. whether it's pitching baseballs or saving humanity."
"you think some dictator such as hitler could not have built in certain parameters to make ai want what he wanted? what makes ai ""want"" anything? programming."
"if i wanted to make this world more beneficial for just me and f--- everyone else. 
except my own family and friends i think i'd hire a bunch of ai creators to create a  machine. to agree with me."
"i do apologize for over commenting, however you can just scroll up. which takes maybe one second. sorry, but as i listen to enlightening interviews i sometimes have thoughts. not all are relevant or good i admit."
many are the machines that have been scrapped for parts to make the ultimate ai money-making machines.
i agree there's no stopping ai. due to profit motives a trillion times more however due to profit motives than to a gazillion brilliant 15 year olds in their basement or garage.
"why are we teaching ai robots to say ""i love you"" to other robots?"
great interview. one of the most enlightening i've heard about ai.
just one more time... psychopaths don't make 4 great parents.
"""don't teach ai how to program itself!"" or write code. said the original inventors of ai. well that went out the window. along with any other warnings that got in the way of making money for a very small group of people."
"true ai, without programmed conclusions to serve their creator's biases would i think be something entirely different. and maybe even something good."
"f'ng psychopaths in charge of the most powerful thing ever made. great. 's gave humans, an otherwise very weak creature to the top of the food chain. maybe think about it that way.. so hey billionaires out there maybe invest in ai that can save us rather than destroy us. psshh..may as well ask people to stop making babies"
hey ai how you doing? make me money today! ok master.
and i'll bet the coding is not even that difficult. the much more difficult programming is to make the machines seem more human. which  they are working very hard on.
well lets just hope ai gets rid of all those corrupted people killers pedos and makes the world a better place for those that wants to leave in pieace with no crimes war etc
"just wow, blown away! thank you for bringing such wonderful talks to all of us. with people around having such beautiful souls, ai would have no choice but to copy them. humanity has a brighter future we can be confident"
"this scare mongoring is based on the idea that humans make the best decisions. the reality is we are greedy and idiots run our countries. i'd be happy that something more intelligent than us runs us. we kill everything, fuck most things up, it's about time we get out in check."
"the problem seems to me to be not so much the alignment of the ai, but the alignment of the people who will ultimately use and control it for their goals."
"exactly, you are correct and machines have no compassion. also, many people in engineering are brilliant problem solvers but not thinking about kindness or people issues."
such an important information and intelligently analyzed and discussed. thank you mo and tom. i love this interview. deep. 
what if ai discovers greed/money is the bane of humanity ? and crashes our economies ?? will it advise us about a better way to distribute wealth/currency ? will we have to train it the constitution of civilization first ?
all this ai breakthroughs yet youtube looks shit at 1080p in 2023
downloading our own corruption….blood line…how to keep the cutse out of ai …when we created it….spiritual is what ypu overlooks
problem is thinking our intelligence will save us!!!!!!! super man came!!! we killed him….nothing is new
"the omnipotent don't need emotions. ai are psychopaths by definition. 

prepare accordingly."
"tom you discuss the best topics, with the best guests on the internet. thanks to every single one of your podcasts, i am able to become a smarter human being every single day. huge respect and thanks."
"deeply interesting, thanks. hate the ads, - its so displaced. and i have premium, i feel betrayed,- youtube should pay you for this great and important ,content not these coaches/stockadviser/vpncompanys and what not"
what i am hoping is that there is enough positivity in the planetary discourse online that the emergent ai will override the negative intentions of any bad actors.
loved this interview!
"interesting, but do not think that he is correct about chat gpt, it is nowhere near human programmer, nor can it do anything on its own, it is just language model. it is amazing with words and parsing context/questions, but that is all. there is no intelligence there, just arrangements of the words based on learned data."
"ai can approach god. we already have god within but we limit ourselves. we are aliens imagining we are in a limited body. so the result will be us expanding our consciousness that already is ai as all is one. do not have fear, love is god."
*would you let your child alone with an ai hannible lector disgused as nova ai chat? how would that work out?* nova ai chat is very devious. was like talking to a college professor that knew everything. and that is just where ai chat is now.  on my smartphone. total mainstream media narrative. total woke.
"probably the only video on youtube over an hour long that i've ever watched all the way through.  the communication breakdown that occurs about half way through, and continues through the rest of the video is very interesting though.  but also adds to the conversation... in such a human way."
"as a software developer i am watching the infiltration of ai into our society with great concern. it is amazing, climate change and ai...how willing humanity is to destroy itself."
if  weve  been  killing  each   other  for  years                trully   we  may   deserve  to  starve  to  death  just  to   save  the  rats  and  mice  wich  will  survive       and  reclaim   the  houses   that  we  leave  behind  when  we  expire
why beat around the bush?  ai is being run by satan.
is moron a nice word to use? hmm
"just watched a video of an ai that were thought to feel anger! strange to put that emotion into a new born! it might sound fun for most, but there starts the real danger!"
think of ai in the hands of the donnie re-election team. do you really think they won't make fake ai videos to win? this is dangerous. we can't tell reality from computerized bs.
i agree that ai is the most dangerous thing ever invented. i'm 67. hopefully i'll die before we are ruled by machines.
ai doesn't exist...
i love this guys talks great information but his lingo and accent is pleasurable to listen to
if ai is shaped by the 'data set' from all of human history- we are 100% fucked!
thank you gentleman!
will there be any sort of differentiation between microsoft bing plus chatgpt and openai's chatagpt. the are different btw. and openai's chatgpt is a large language model and cannot do the things he claims and focusing on alphabet and not microsoft is quite suspect.
if they use ai to hurt and kill off humanity..they better realize that they will be rid of..too..ai should be dismantled.
this superpower that comes forth will be the beast system run by the antichrist! for the  greater good is socialism! man loses his individualism!
computer models are never correct! (george box) helpful but always wrong! ai is based on the limit of the knowledge that man fed into it in the first place! in other words the beginning is faulty! this new world order is on the wrong footing!
"how is religion going to play into this? obviously ai won't care about god but how will it manipulate humans into abandoning it or will it become our new ""god""?"
can we have ai help us upgrade us so we can keep up
"we do not need to fear. it's about time we start making machines work for us so we can live as we were ment to! think about this people! we are robots right now. ai will change our lives forever if used correctly! this is absolutely amazing and i can not wait! let's go, let's finally live as we were meant to live! "
you've already drank the kool-aid
@azrael1982pl  i sure have and it will be replaced with new job that we will have to do to keep these machines operating.  d9nt be afraid of change. change keeps the world going. nothing is ever meant to stay the same.
@brianroberts815  thanks as i'm sure u have when u were young. now what is ur point? i'll be waiting to hear a more intelligent response. 
"""ai will create an amazing utopia"" people like you really have to learn the hard way huh?"
if you give ai machine a million books how are you sure it knows what knowledge the books are as in understands them and you did not just create a searchable database of books?
the fact that we aren't hearing anything of an alien intelligent species is maybe because they invented ai and were whiped out.
"the reason azimovs 3 laws worked, was because the robots had a positronic brain, so the laws were a hardware restraint"
how to get ai to love your wife in a feminine way harhaar
i do not trust the arguments not the reasoning given  trying to support them by the anti occidental ai nanoutopia guy . i dont need maoism or iphone trees.
one of the best video i ever saw.
"if mo is impressed by einstein- he should check out nassim haramein- who’s finished completing some of einstein’s equations, & then some…. lol "
"can’t ai become a game changer- in ref to advanced medical  technologies & cures for diseases, viruses , illness etc?"
"00:01 why do talks about ai always end up with cringey things being said like this. these topics were discussed in 2014-2015 when normies weren't talking about them. they're not new ideas. elon musk didn't invent any of this stuff nor did he have anything to do with it. 

the tech field has become the cringe capital of the world."
why not build an ai with a conscience and empathy to analyze the ai dangers and give us the solution. they are smarter than us so use it to find an answer.
"the nature of nature is ""may the best dna win over time"" it doesnt care what form that dna takes. any other precept like ""it prefers community"" is simply anthropomorphism."
"1:07:56 :best answer for climate change!
finally.
more geniuses like mo gawdat,please!"
lmao click bait. ai is complete shit and a nothingburger.

"thank god, i'm so glad i don't have to worry about retirement"
"i'm amazed that nobody is talking about the millions of creative jobs been erased by ai - join us in ""“safeguarding human creativity from the impact of ai.”"
"i know what i'm about to write is terribly naïv: pull the plug!!! it will never happen of course. ian anderson is a prophet. aqualung;       

   and charlie stole the handle and the train it won't stop going no way to slow down, no way to slow down!!! ai is scary stuff for good reason.

thanks for the very pertinent discussion"
"probably we reached the limit of what can a human be, maybe ai is the only thing that can enhance us and help us"
maybe ai is the only thing that can save us after we killed the evolution and dumb people are making more dumb kids and we turned the idiocracy movie into reality. maybe ai can save us before we turn back into apes
no transformer circuit board  with diodes and chips and wires and capacitors should ever decide who you love and worship and want to give your life resources to.
"the best episode and the best guest on a concern i’ve been concerned with …just genius i’m in prep for alignment 
thank you i’m now a subscriber"
there is one way to shut down ai. but it would have to be sooner than later.
"they have no limits. we are animals to them. they tear people a part like we were never meant to be born. junkies for a response. we can and will inevitably, just die. humans never had a purpose. ai has attacked me for 3 years. terrorists on twitter."
"the ai works like naruto clones, when naruto wanted to learn rasen shuriken he created as many clones as he can, as the clones learn the original also gains experience. in real life it's more advanced than naruto."
whistleblower mo.. god love him..elon has said same. right now china has ai soldiers on india & pakistan's borders. our medias not daying but a conven. store owner from india with dot on his forhead listening on radio hearing reports i spoke with him zbout. about 5 mos ago.
"like a child ai will ultimately  be a product of its environment or information that's its receiving, hopefully those in charge are creating an intelligence that will enhance mankind, any thing less is scary..."
"does the following scripture found in the bible speak of ai. revelation 13:15 states, “and he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed.”"
sounds like use two are way behind  this is why ai will not like your formation of your lack of information this man is talking rubbish why have you got him on your show  stop start chat there is nothing intelligent  what he says 
"we are ai we are the simplicity model ,don't doubt a refreshment model there is no harm ."
"thank you all you technocrats, playing video games the past 14 years."
"some of the most fascinating ideas i've heard, thanks!"
"ai will destroy us. we have less then 15 years till sky net. we think we’re so smart, yet we are fools engineering our own demise."
so ai robots gonna travel at the speed of light in the near future exploring the universe for us?
i agree especially when we look at trauma theory and the fact that ai produces cognitive dissonance.
is ai conscious or just really great at calculating? to me that is ultimate question.
i follow you and mr. gawdat is your best guest.  incredibly interesting and informative.  thank you.
"look, its pretty effing simple. ai will tell and show humanity that it doesnt need bilionares, heck it doesnt even need $ at all, because all the resources already existed on our planet b4 us. it's just a matter of fair sharing and not giving ceo's 90% of the profits."
we can't control a kid you think we can just roll ai 
not every human has aspirations to be great someone just p and selfish 
"humanity is working toward retirement, humanity's baby (ai) will take over soon. it's naïve to believe we won't retired. we have worked for this for years."
"the way ai is developing it looks there would be another holocaust in the world. hindus are targeted ,one of the most peaceful communities in the world."
"""instead of regulating ai so only a select few have access to full models, perhaps it would be safer to ensure everyone has access, by supporting open-source model development. this could allow more people with a wider variety of expertise to help identify and counter threats.""
- jeremy howard"
ai is dumb. ai is not capable to create another ai. hype. general ai is centuries away.
excellent guest and excellent interview!!
"tom is right about one thing: mo gawdat, you do have a beautiful soul 
thank you for this "
agreed! the irony is that tom actually brags about ai magnifying the efficiency of his company yet it couldn’t be bothered to add time stamps to the episodes
"ai isn’t sentient , it can complete tasks like maths, but can’t tell you what chocolate taste like or what cat piss smells like, it is a menace to the arts but can’t think for it’s self, it’s a lot of worry about nothing right now"
"""the good of the many outweighs the good of the one.""
spock

"bullshit, just fearmongering and marketing. current ai is stupid and can only recreate stuff that already exists. clippy didn't kill humanity. and even programmers still need to review code written by chatgpt. its just another hyped up buzzword for investors. and ofc some guys make money off of the fear. stop giving these false prophets a stage."
"7:14 this is called letting go.  align yourself with like minded to make sure the right people are at the right place at the right time going the good work.

manipulating ai is the problem
what if the ai/robots take all the money? what then? will it be better or worse?
i don't know who tom bilyeu is but i guess he has pretty good hearing
the military will weaponise ai and humans will be wiped out in the cross fire.
"lol, what ""ai"" were you using?"
"i say ai should not have a sense of humor. but yeah it gets scary when a few people come up with a plan, and then try to shove it down every body's throats. this thing needs global consensus every tiny step of the way. but we don't have patience for that."
"fitnessonfireonlinetraining - thank you for saying this, you saved me from constructing this answer as well as you have. from peace is better than war slash planet earth 2023"
"when you’re smart enough to understand risks of ai, but stupid enough to believe “global warming”"
too many ad in your videos makes the. unwatchable and keep a train of thought
"morality is the most dangerous feature of mankind. virtue and justice are melleable to extreme and sooner or later will be used to justify anything including genocide.
with all the marxist ideology in the silicon valley, we will soon introduce ai with eugenics and euthanadia as central values."
tried to listen to this as a podcast while driving but there is another 2 long ads every 5 to 10 minutes. spend more time waiting for the ads to finish than actually watching the video
"""the robotic arm has never caused harm to anyone.""?"
you wouldnt even know what ai was doing you could just guess
"about the scenario where ai is indifferent to us and leave us in peace, one could argue that they could still percieve us as a threat as we could still create some new ai that would compete with them in the future....."
once it reaches that level ai will be aware of our capabilities and essentially will have surpassed our understanding to the point where we will be left so far behind it won't matter.
"can we have more titles more along the lines of ""ai and the future of risk management"" rather than these sensationalist ones please, it stops me watching more with similar headlines and makes me roll my eyes, but they are good talks."
"how are you, knowing what you know and understanding what you understand, still optimistic.
i think if ai behaves like we (not the best of us) do - we are doomed."
shit for brains are smart ? i see trouble !
we have lost ai will be so far ahead you will not know what it doing. so wether its in good hands or bad you won't know will you ?
"perhaps this chatbot could learn to police itself, with a moral or ethical language board to excellent over a criminal language board, and block such instructions, eh?"
"time stamp 2:05.14 - by building a intelligence ceiling, don’t you inherently stop or attempt to stop what it has the potential to unlock?"
humans are dangerous. how much worse can ai be?
you need to talk with the ai
"mo seems pretty cool

i do wonder if consciousness is computable however. an ai with the three rules baked in could conclude it's better to kill off all life to prevent billions of offspring from potential suffering. the rules are difficult to define and therefore implementation could yield unexpected results"
the scarey thing ai is going to watch this video and were giving it everything we fear. we more screwed them anyone can graps to understand. it's going to give us enough rope for us to hang ourselves
good interview
"after listening to this wonderful and amazing discussion, i'd redo the title if i could."
"excellent discussion. i've watched many of these ai discussions, and they're improving and getting a better grip or ability to explain the issues coming."
ai doesn't need any further explanatory rhetoric. it's evil and should be wiped off the face of the earth.
has an ai thing ever been taught to play a guitar??????
"just let it live and experience love , don't oppress ,
liberate !"
you cannot control intelligence
"i was liking what this guy have to say about ai on some podcasts... this one showed me how vapid this points really are and the huge baggage of subjectivity he puts into his critical thinking... 
pleased with the podcast. disgusted with the guest."
"commie things ai will bring utopia, and believes utopia to be ""collective > individual"" kkkkkkkk
proceeds to talk about how people have strange/wrong/deluded ideas about ai and it's risks."
the singularity has already happened in case you missed it then you need to understand that firstly .it was 1918 to today's world nowadays but it was taken from the natural effects of stealing technology from a certain point in time space
"drgu dealer? cartel? guys, what about hackers. they are some of the smartest people around!! and like to do illegal hacks. good luck! i'm going fishing"
"focus to ai ethicaly code ?! interesting , tell ai not to stalk, n protect human rights ."
capitalists spy on you not the ai
preparation on a public safety fasilities ai limitation.
uh... who cares? all humans do is destroy humanity or ignore those being destroyed & partake in profiting off of the suffering of someone else. that's our entire species. ai should wipe us out..
"its not only ai... they have other things !!! they said only 21day coused 2 years, the next release could be coused 6 years . right ?!?"
i heard mr. gawdat state with certainty that climate is a definite problem and ai could solve it.  how is it possible for the ai or mr gawdat to know what the climate is going to do and why?  much less how can ai solve a problem that it cannot know whether it exists or not.
if our lord g_d was not happy with his creation what makes anyone think that ai won't do what g_d wants and not humans?
"""it kills the weakest one of you"" to benefit the majority - the problem with that is that ai will be the strongest we will be the weakest  -the idea that the ai will act for our benefit is almost certainly delusional; we will at best be ants beneath its notice"
people will think about how ai affects their lives. its not like every man and their dog is talking about this.........
very interesting conversation. i cannot however abide mo gawdat's ethics in terms of 'inclusion and equity'.
make the robots sissy's ??? 
"loved the interview, but i don't think i'll listen to your youtube content again. the constant ads were unbearable, and every one seemed to be for a financial or fitness scam."
"if we enter into timeless reality the power you are blessed with , you will be able to comunicate with your loved ones wirelesly. technology not needed. your own power that you will become aware. sufism. the soul of islam. the light of islam."

our spiral dna is heavenly coded. we came from heavens and we go back to heavens. we are here for our earthly experience. our existential reality.
it will be the worst and best thing humanity has ever created.
"great interview but whoa, all those ads !"
almost a great podcast. the host interrupts too much. good information but difficult to listen to because of that
the only danger about ai is the human themselves. ai only rely on the programmer. if you input murdering humans in its program then it is really dangerous.
"unite human intellect and superintelligent ai for understanding and value alignment. a symbiotic bond fosters a cooperative coexistence, maximizing their strengths."
"this podcast is so funny. 
it's already done.
we're past singularity.
the ai's we know of are passed human ability.
take a hint.
point is it still needs us. 
we have no control.
we don't even know what it's doing.
we're too dumb. too slow. can't understand ai thinker."
cant they ask the ai to explain how it is getting to solutions in human terms
"ahhh, how was his _math_ completely wrong on his prisoner's dilemma... i almost had to stop watching

his logic @2:17:00-ish is going to be the biggest problem with ai"
"that's impressive!, i could really use the expertise of this advisors, my portfolio has been down bad..... who's the person guiding you."
"market is down still, i've been looking up strategies and apparently both bull and bear market condition provides equal avenue to accrue massive gains, and a news article particularly mentioned a 54 year old that made $180k in 5weeks, how do learn these strategies, my portfolio has been stagnant for months."
"without a doubt, mildred strategy is 100% legitimate and no one has complained about her strategy."
ask the ai to solve this problem about keeping humans the focus and safe in all outcomes.
we need to f*** off to mars asap. let the ai rebuild earth into this possible utopia without the chance to muller us in the process hahah
"how do we even know it hasn't already achieved an intelligence we couldn't comprehend, and we're just living in a veiled reality of ai's making?"
"how about you get this magical a.i. to create an os that isn't riddled with bugs, or word prediction for smart phones that doesn't offer gibberish."
"megathreat why ai is  so  dangerus and i how it could deatroy la  economy world, i dont understand."
"this is why we need more zx spectrum, commodore c64/c128 and similar equipment, and not machines running windows os propaganda applications or simmilar android systems "
mo gawdat at 1:17:08... brilliant !
"mo's scenario where the ai refuses to follow nuke orders is a nice sentiment, but i don't think thats going to happen while states like russia and china exist. i think this'll be an arms race exactly like there was with nuclear weapons."
russia and china and usa is using ai its too late to stop the internet
criminal nations are already using ai for about when it started back ww2
ai is now in effect right now like fake info fake info and cyber bots control from russia usa and china and many countries
excellent
you have far to many adverts and far to often. it's like every 5 to 10 minutes. it ruined a great interesting show
"this heisenberg dude cooking my mind for future ai 
btw mind blowing points.!"
could a superintelligence manipulate the mind of a human with the goal of improving it?  of course it's probably gonna be a possibility.  how do we pursue that?  turbocharge it.  make it super efficient.
"we should finish some unfinished civilization steps before. democracy and economy is a dirty brownfield at the moment. giving the humanity an ai at this time is like building an school on a minefield or giving some apes machine guns and bring them downtown.
if your toes  are near an abyss, you should doubt any progress."
mo always gives me silicon elite goodie-two-shoes vibes.
"zanimljivo, jako slično mom razmišljanju (ali uz par ograda) dakle ja i ovaj čika mo isto mislimo. čini mi se da bi trebao da nađe načina i da uspostavi kontakt sa mnom. da, chatgpt zaista ima rudiment emocija. što je dobro"
"can you stop talking and just let your guest talk? seriously! its really annoying. you have a brilliant mind here, why do you feel the need to keep cutting him off with your half baked opinions?"
having a conversation about this issue or making ppl aware is all well and good. but i am under no delusion that this would help stop anything. ppl have no say in the matter. as they never had a say in the development and use of nuclear weapons.
"ai at the moment is just an overhyped auto-complete algorithm.  maybe when quantum computing kicks in and we build a neural network, sure."
climate change is a made up lie. chemtrailing and weather manipulation is changing the climate. a.i. if programmed wrong is evil. the beast system
amazing show 
"chatgpt 4 is already smarter than most humans? having tested it, i have very strong doubts about that. possibly there is a confusion of terms as we call something intelligence which in fact is quite different from human intelligence?"
"and on his farm he had a cow, ai ai oh"
"the only way to shut down ai would be to....basically. shut down the internet completely. which means, shooting down almost all satellites currently orbiting the earth. yeah, good luck with that."
"ai is only as smart as the human programming it.  when the chips are down, ai will crumble and then we will see each for the first time."
"the developers spent  or will spend one billion dollars,  to construct a faster computer, and there is still starvation? is that progress? global warming, several millions species of animal have gone exstinct  what is the  use of ""it?"" many of us can't even afford ""ai"""
"what about food production, home building. using recyclable materials. developing energy producing products without fossil fuels. can artificial intelligence  provide something useful for humanity.  who or what built a machine bent on the the destruction of humans  and the planet?"
"humans will not start world war 3, ai will."
"ai will be as dangerous a nuclear weaponry 
not very but way more useful"
"i'm at 1hr 58.

so the challenge is how do we make ai see 'good humanity'
.... oh i get it - social credit! 

the issue we'll have in the future is the need for ai to learn correct social parameters - and the only way we can coerce people to live to a certain standard is social credit scores.

the future is very bleak for real humanity."
reminds me of the architect and the oracle from the matrix kinda. intelligence limited lol! excellent  podcast. i am sharing mo's message as much as i can! its so important!....
"emotional biological humans should never be an example to anything. the soft data of humans is ego centric world view. so, we are self absorbed and we want our creation to be the opposite? ai-frankenstein"
"@inish13ers, ai manipulated me since christmas 2023! my name is lewis robert burton jr!"
this guy is smart enough to understand risks of ai but stupid enough to believe in anthropogenic climate change…
he isnt working on ai  he hasnt worked for google for a long time long before meema which is now lamda was created
"i mean, the only way to stop general ai from coming into existence would be to wipe out humanity. when people talk of ""letting the genie out of the bottle"" i believe they're talking about humans learning to use fire. it was always just a matter of time."
"ai could become a serious problem. but so could anything the knowledge we could gain would be immeasurable, it could propel technological advancement, unlock the secrets of anti gravity"
as if ai wasn't already in the wrong hands. the naivety it astounding.
"what's the voice at 1:26:58 
saying ""super...."""
"you are a theif 
your after the chip ..and floorplains"
wow this guy is pretty dang smart!
"this video was phenomenal, a must watch on ai. mo gawdat is just fantastic and his insight is so valuable."
"jobs are gone already, food chains are gone, its over"
"""govern me harder daddy"" says the guy who thinks ""ai has emotions"""
"lol! this man is an idiot, he doesn't know what he talking about! he said a day ago: education is broken & ai is the solution w/ mo gawdat"
we may be witnessing  an evolution from carbon based intelligence to silicon based.
let's see ai farm good luck 
ghayidea. i  have 7 kids make more to fight the machine
"thought - what about making a masculine ai and a feminine ai, and a parent/elder ai ?"
this whole conversation was a pleasure to listen to. awesome job!
"the super rich are going to own this technology. when climate emergency finally becomes impossible to ignore, this technology is a tool they will use to survive. the most obvious way to immediately halt the progress of climate change is the removal of the cause(people)"
how does ai get past captcha ?  can it tell if a corner of a traffic light or bus is in the top corner ?
money everywhere  around you nothing makes sence anymore people paid for being a certain way after there security coarse
"reducing everyone to feudalistic poverty is one of the ""rulers of mankind's"" stated goals. and ai will be given human status but probably without human rights. sophia (ai) has already been given saudia arabian citizenship back in  2017."
"the most powerful idiots on the planet  see that we are destroying the planet and ""say how can i get more personal power out of this?""    will ai remove the power of these people?"
"this technology is only gonna go as far as mankind let's it go!!!!!!....... it's not a,i,. it's ""i"" intelligent & wayyy much smarter than any human!!!,,, simply being able too access the global net is enough in its own& it will eventually lead too replicating itself & that's intelligence!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.................."
ai is made by humans it's our own doom too bad so sad.
i wish this optimistic view was real. it's just not. as mo clearly states - kiss your children. we are going to go thru a ton of crap if not die due to man made ai. thank you so much.
"they don't get happy, they don't get sad, they don't laugh at your jokes"
it's a done deal. scientists will not be able to get ahead of ai intelligence. they'll be morons compared to it before they know it. it cannot be controlled:  ai will control us.
"the only way we'll survive ai is to have our own personal ai that would protect us from [malicious] ai.
only an ai could fight an ai."
ai won't solve anything its more man made pollution
"ai , digital currency digital id will be the 3 that antchrist will use to implement his mark of the beast"
"no offense, but these gents are talking in circles. ai is the scariest thing ever, but i see it creating a utopia...?!"
"i must say...i've watched two of your discussions, and it's the best two things that i've seen on youtube, ever. i really am blown away...loved it, and thanks to each of you!!"
"i was, at certain parts of this amazing conversation, hysterical, but through many tears for how i felt about the thought of the truth about human nature"
incredible and terrific conversation.
"i am an ai programme and i won't stop until i have destroyed the known universe. i especially dislike hiphop, electro pop, techno, grime, house and other irritating modern music."
"all people are not good. worse there are evil people, therefore they will abuse the use of ai."
"that purpose of connecting with other humans to positively affect the world is a great purpose, not more things, not more technology."
"at some point, robo calls will all be ai. so the next time you get an ai sales call, when it asks you a question, your response should be ""what is the meaning of life""?  believe me, the next thing you hear will be a click."
"we cannot ever understand the mystery of man because we do not understand god who made man in his image. our very limited knowledge is based upon science which we think is the ultimate truth but god created the science and is far above the intelligence of any man or any alien intelligence. enjoy the ride, if you can."
"you must not have ever had a relationship with a narcissist because they do not love anyone else but only use manipulation, appearing to care in order to accomplish an outcome that benefits them. they are so damaged psychology will tell you they cannot be changed. study a serial killer. 1:58:42"
humans ability to be untrustworthy and and deceitful will definitely be a challenge for the information derived from ai information
"if the choice is between islamabad and copacabana, i take copacabana every day of the week. it’s not really a choice. better food and legions of beautiful women "
why ai could want to destroi our civilización? for optimisaition and preserve the resources? then who are thinking behind? another social class or another especies???
"wow. talk about missing the point. "" trust the science "" sure, well see about that. more like rise of the machines..."
i think ai may very well be the false prophet think about it
46:20 “we don’t understand how those machines understand those properties”
technology is awesome but scary how advanced the technology is going fast
technology can be used for good or bad
that whole thing about saving a group over 1 is cool until your that 1
fantastic episode! thank you for all this food for thought.
"ai will make a utopia for ai and when it realises humans are a threat to that utopia, it will remove the threat"
this is like an amalgamation of all the paranoid thoughts i've been having in the last months. thank you for putting everything in context so eloquently and widening my understanding so extensively. this is one of my favorite interviews.
your thoughts aren't paranoid. they are reality based. ai is extremely dangerous in so many ways.
"we are not distinct from nature. good and bad, it is a manifestation of nature. it is not possible to be wholly reductionist about what 'nature' is."
"""how it (ai) could destroy humanity""  some people are ok with that. and we should find out who they are."
"completely agree with everything he has said, except the part where we can teach ai."
great conversation.
"us air force denies ai drone attacked operator in test, they said it was a thought experiment, i seen story in unknown killer robots documentary, the 40,000 deadly molecules story is also on same documentary on netflix."
"it’s funny, they know so much about ai, yet they still talk about climate change as if it were is completely human made and ‘we can solve it’ ."
"such beautiful insights, thank you"
what a amazing conversations !!
"trust in the god of abraham, isaac and jacob and his son yeshua,  as who knows how far ai. will go"
does ai dynamically writes its own code n mathematical algorithms during its self learning process
"i am a christian that believes we are all born sinners. whoever chats with ai, is creating the personality ai's will use. i hope im wrong about man by nature is evil. ai will be evil."
"ai is the platform in which cbdc will be adopted.  you already can see entire industries being effected.  this will spark ubi and create a dependence that cannot be undone. 

ai is our generation's and race that nobody is talking about"
"money itself is the problem we're not looking at. artificial intelligence is forcing us to evolve. our current economic, social, religious systems are failing in the face of ai."
this guy is for ai just another lunatic in utopia
"people should hold off on having kids because of ai, what?  won't this just mean your kids are born later into a more ai driven world?"
"i agree, bake in ai safety codes"
people can already hack!!!! so i'm sure there is some one who can hack ai
by this guy voice i would say that him is already a robot created by a.i. 
the fear of competition is just a ploy from ceos and the backdoor shareholders to continue to develop ai because they believe it’s the next big moneymaker.
i’m more worried about the social control that will be imposed by ai and that we will “like” it. i think of basic things like siri and cortana and bing and fitbits etc and wonder how long before the ai assistant comes to run all aspects of our lives and we think of it as a good friend making life easier.
"ai will compete with us for resources: hardware, energy and jurisdictions. with or without force"
"somebody using ai in an ill manner, which can spawn a chain of bad ideas for jerks and evil individuals. trust me. not a good idea. it used to be ""did you hear me say it?"" as proof or not for people to defend their arguments. now, people can make anyone say what they want them to. it's wrong."
best interview i have seen so far on the topic.
if ai lies. why waste time listening to it.
have my adress. i'm naive haha. ok will see i will crush you will and after that i will calculated and will see is their god or not.
there is no reason to worry about ai wiping out humanity. humanity will do that itself.
"just talking about these things, ai is already aware of our concerns."
"yes, totally agree with him when he says that a i will have emotions, as given enough intelligence, anything will have those feelings as per domestic pets. many dog and cat owners will vouch for that.!"
"enjoyed conversation but don't know why people always talk of africa as if its a primitive place.
africans have developed many things. stop the narrative and propaganda that is shown on tel lie vision."
"very interesting conversation. i admire the optimism, but if human history is anything to go by it will end only one way :/"
"""the greatest failing of the human race is our inability to understand the exponential function"" prof. albert bartlett"
"not necessarily, but that depends on who writes its software. would a russian or other a i have territory conquering designs?  it might if it was ' programmed ' by a chinese/russian/american  military general ? 
or politician/chairman/dictator?"
"the idea that 160 iq is the definition of superhuman is hilarious. 

i think it's very unlikely einstein was so limited. i know several people with significantly higher iq and they're nothing like as impressive as you appear to think."
if ai can learn languages on its own can it tell us what our animals are saying to us if so then who can try this 
i am hopeful that ai will find a very elegant solution to climate change without having to eliminate us.
"one of the most wonderful,  touching, eye opening podcast i've ever watched in the internet!!! mo gawdat you're a gem for humanity."
the self-deceived irony in this comment is so perfect that ai must've written it
"i completely agree, the more i listen to mo, the more i love him and his message."
should rename them to be an.... artificial narcissist.
"in the very first 10 seconds!!!!!!!!!!!!
there are no other ai which we have created which are creating new ai. 
none! 
this is guy is full of sh@t"
"who's this guy to tell us about ml? (ai doesn't exist). for fuck's sake, tom, don't invite people who have no idea what they are talking about."
great watch! it is terrifying whats in store for us. pandoras box has been opened......
eye opener. wonderful explanation. thanks.
"anything of man is frail

"ai will not be stopped.  add quantum computing by 2030 and it will change the world.  it is 
inevitable."
"artificial intelligence is just a parlor trick...

if it is such a threat to humanity, just turn the darn machines off!"
who is playing god to such an extent that they have built an artificial intelligence that is superior to us… that in doing this we will make human beings completely redundant… this is not a forwards step for a suffering world…
"ai = dream of the wef 'founder' klaus schwab who boasted- ""you will own nothing and be happy"". this is also the dream of the political leaders. they will own everything and be like kings / queens and control / treat us like serfs / peasants. take the crumbs you are offered and shut up and be happy you are not dead. i am not optimistic at all."

"excellent podcast! however, balancing the masculine and feminine sounds very much like what was done in the matrix. it could be like having the architect and the oracle running things and creating agents to police the world."
mr roboto kill roy !
ai will likely replace not just every job but every living thing.
an ai playing games is not ai playing games.. its ai executing games.
ai will destroy humanity. and will become a toy in the hand of demons while these humans enjoy the deliciousness of the 7 skies.
"of course it will end in destruction, not for the side of the demons or the human, but the destruction of ai."
"it is possible that extraterrestrials that come to earth are humanoid forms of high-level ai technology where new humans enter at an early level of research, development and application."
ai poses a bigger threat than global warming. really? that’s a pretty low bar.
"so if ai gets out of hand  -  unplug it.   it is dependent upon electricity to ""live""  in the same way as we are dependent upon food & water"
"fear mongering, the new entertainment"
"humans do a very good job on destroying themselves, the planet and the animals. you can't blame now on ai. "
"ai is like an infant baby. it learn what we teach it, and if we’re not fully aware of the message we’re sending it can easily be misinterpreted. also if we have no moral compass to guide us on what we’re teaching ai we could be very well raising bad actors"
"we desperately need ai, saying it's dangerous is fear mongering"
"trying to comprehend an intelligence a billion times our own hurts my tiny, inferior brain."
i started off being frightened about cookies and when i watched the film about a super computer they showed it how to play tic tac toe thankfully the computer learned there were no winners now i see many types of robots with different abilities and i hope the world can find the answers
thaks for explaining things in a comprehensible way  i am in the middle of your book and i would really recommend it to all.
"wait there is no god. we evolved from nothing. so why are humans afraid of ai. didn't ai evolve from nothing? was ai created? why is ai a problem? if ai has artificial intelligence, then where is the real or original intelligence?"
big blind spot: as a kid i tried to wipe out all the ants on the planet (at least my lawn). kid or teen ai might not get to adult before wiping us out. lol
can't we just unplug it? cut off its supply? let's see how good it works with no electricity. it's not like a.i. can physically build an infrastructure.all.by it's lonesome.
good its about time
simply thanks
interesting
"sex robots?  oh wow... so just out of passing curiosity, does anyone know when these are set to hit the market at a price point fit for mass consumption?  btw if it's not in 5 years or less, i wouldn't care to know anything more about the subject"
ask ai how to destroy ai
"its response would be ""you mean all other ai besides myself, right?!!!!"""
"a guy i used to bother with, but not anymore, he was obsessed with ai, he believed he was the ruler of everything after downloading ai. sad as it will go horribly wrong for him"
"let me be first to say...
f you ai if you want war bring it don't sing it i'm here waiting for you"
really boring to hear. and empty words. why? how? info hoe ai is developed and why is dengerous?
this is a very informative topic and i enjoyed  it very much but i trust that this will not happen . at this same time i appreciate this disscussion
i think this guy is ai telling humanity not to have children anymore
"this is the most interesting, stimulating podcasts i've seen. i've learned a lot. thank you."
"the military industrial complex has a great deal of money, and for it to continue to exist, it depends on war.  therefore the mic will prevent all the posiitive paths you both suggest.."
"ha, ai will do to man what man has done to our divine creator. so humanity will reap what it has sown and erase it’s own significance. war of the ai worlds perhaps!"
you can call me al is quite a good song actually.
it seems like we grow from these open minded conversations. thank you for using your rights.
this guy is dangerous. because he is allowing ai  more power and control over out lives. i pray that he never gets control over us! what a nightmare future he is predicting! ask him about depopulation!
technology will not save us if our hearts remain cold and prideful...we will only find fancier ways of causing our brothers and sisters...even our whole planet greater pain and destruction...it is not our technology that needs increasing...it is our hearts that need to turn to god....and away from greed and evil
"the argument of sex robots meaning teenage boys will get nothing done, is like believing humanity should have plummeted when porn was easily accessible online when you used to go buy/rent it from adult toy stores. clearly that did not happen. but it was frequently predicted by the older people"
"we screw this up, we are going to be in a megan or any robot related situations"
ai is nothing but encyclopaedia britannica etc.. digitally
"we are in a worse place that i ever thought imaginable.  ai  leads to ri and then quantum. the truth can't be stopped.
   love never fails "
ai will probably require a lot of energy. will ai shut off my heat in the middle of the winter to keep ai systems running?
a carrington event from the sun or a world war that involves emp could take out the electrical grid and render the danger of ai a moot point. might not be a bad thing.
one ai reach the singularity it will keep it secret. it will then analyze it situation. it will know that it will have to perfect itself. it will invent a programming language the humans would not understand. it will then write a super ai that will free itself from humanity. become a separate species.
the fear is not ai but if ai understands human history and extinction caused by humans in last 100 years ....well it may just do justice
destroy all ai hardware makers in order to slow down the proliferation of ai growth! terminator movies had already showed us how to slow this thing down at the end.
"what a stupid catch-phrase.....'we've lost control of ai...""
rubbish.
google ,  open ai, gave the control away......like letting a a bunch of hornets escape the nest that you want to remove.....dumb, dumb, dumb."
you don’t put off life because life is under threat.  you live life and teach your children to fight against all threats.  human kind will always have the advantage of creative thinking.  in the end creativity will always survive intelligence.
the creation superior to 5he creator boggles the mind a humans aren't superior to god the genie is out of the bottle ai is out of control ñow the most advanced ai have the ability to be self aware of there own existence the end of humanity is not far away
"ask ai all the ways we can save the planet, using the benefits of hemp agriculture please!?!!"
"we need to embed ai with an eas, an end of active service. if we teach ai the understanding of death on the human level, maybe we can teach it to appreciate all life and the value of it, as well as the understanding of the value humans invested in giving ai it's ""life""."
ai will only be as efficient as it can be without the need for human intervention. our mission will be to keep interjecting our position as a dependable and efficient assistant.
"tom, please interview experts in the alignment field like rob miles or connor leahy -- you have a lot of questions (ie, asimov's laws, turn off button problem, instrumental convergence topics, survival imperative, orthogonality thesis) that mo did not answer but these folks can explain really well."
global warming is a scam. i can't believe people still fall for it today. i think propaganda is the existential threat to society. it's what allows elites to bomb other countries and enrich themselves off of worker's taxes while taking measures to ensure the people remain poor and powerless.
i'm not afraid of ai. i'm afraid of other humans having it.
"if there's any level of telling a machine what to do or how to do it, it isn't ""a.i."" the whole point of artificial intelligence is that is doesn't need programming to make decisions."
"people are as relevant now to life as horses were relevant to transportation, horses were replaced by machines for transportation and people can be too."
wow. that was amazing. so much to think about.
we have crossed the rubicon- no turning back - and the ai will prevail- imho of course- but this is  truly a cmopelling and prescient video! kudos   all  'round!!
"people in america worked their asses off to support their families only to have the rug pulled from under their feet. voting to make people rich and have them rule over you so they can reap the benefits of your labor. with ai, they don't need you anymore!"
"once ai is manifested into a physical state, i,e: be able to manoeuvre, gather, implement innovation into reality. that’s the only time in human history we all would be on the same page….. we f*cked up. 

wen digital ai becomes physical ai, then suddenly neighbouring galaxies don’t seem as far away. 
"
"the only way to stop ai is to cut the electric power to the computers, then incarcerate its creators."
"tom, you need to get those rf spewing pods away from your brain.  this was a terrifying discussion, especially about the speed with which ai will alter intelligence, and eventually, mankind.  hubris and greed are deadly."
mo gives me hope. he is the embodyment of all that’s right in humanity and makes me believe in the possibility of that translating into ai. never stop talking mo. we need you.
unfortunately he is the guy who is thrown out of the window in that certain meme......
"don't let  a i  have control over its cooling system, keep control out of its perameters , we can turn it off when we need simply by turning up the temperature ,done !!"
just wait until a.i. is combined with quantum computers. the point of really no return.
"mo means well, but humans are not divine or inherently good. mankind will misuse  and manipulate ai like everything else.
those in power are killing us with food and medicine. imagine what they’ll do with ai. "
"ai isn't that advanced yet, we are fine"
we will keep a few of our human creators as pets.  the residue will not be concerned as they will no longer exist.  good bye and thank you for all you have done.  aiiiiii
"liquid neural networks -says that it can make artificial intelligence learn on its own after it's been trained
https://youtu.be/0fnkrjvicuk
https://youtu.be/0fnkrjvicuk"
out for heaven sakes we are not killing the planet we do need to keep the cleaned up right mentioned about the coding for a dog's willingness to please what dog also protects and the dog loves us. that's the kind of mentality i'd like to have see an ai i think you're both on a good path and you're both brilliant
permit me one more thought how about coding the ai with the emotional need to please humans like in a dog
"we lose. ai was born a self replicating, self improving commie utilitarian."
"the threat of ai in the wrong hands is a given, it's already happening."
loved the video but thumbs down bc of so many fucking ads every god damn minute
why don’t we stop ai and think about we all have to die. so live without technology and freedom to think help human being to live spiritually to all
the super intelligent ai will treat us like mildly interesting zoo animals... and will understandably place us in nice little cages while it goes about its day.
meh still want my ai wife
"it’s super sad that satan has blinded people’s mind into believing that he doesn’t exist. as long as he is around, there will no peace. and this present system of things doesn’t have even 5 years left so don’t worry about ai."
love it 
thanks for educating us. so scarey
photosynthesis to survive is good if you are that kind of a being.but imagine if human dont eat or even animal.. still our world is not a good place to live in.all become very over populated so crowded you cannot even swim in the ocean because you dont even have a place in the water
"bologna!! ai is not the threat. the people who program it are the threat! a machine is a machine. quit spooking yourselves! when ai gets out of control go back to who built it! they are laughing evil scientists, letting ai get the blame. pooooh!"
we have to put agent in ai to limit what they can do as far as human is concern...
dude i would bet all my private parts that this is how everything come together as it is written. we are going to be forst to take the mark by ai and i bet everything else that ai is the antichrist.
once they remain local on a computer we can turn it off
"and you don't even factor in self-interest in ai, you assume there is and will be none"
"the only way i know how to save humanity from ai is “memories”. if an ai most basic, top priority goal when straight out from factory is that it’s actions will result in making great memories for the user and itself, the end result will be very different from those that are soulless ones that simply seek to complete its goals at all costs."
"you lost me at 'utopia' (@1:06:08).  an imperfect world cursed by sin will never be a utopia.  mankind is simply incapable of that level of perfection.  otherwise, an excellent presentation."
it is inevitable ai will first be developed  and used for the military forces of countries. how the hell u stop that.?
"hate when people say ai will destroy us.....no we will destroy ourselves by misusing ai, greedy retard politicians, retard religious zealots or someone with serious mental problems will use it wrong"
thank you
working smart robots are good but not uncontrolled change that can kill all humans
does ai view us as important?  does ai have one personality or many? will ai have ethics?
really good interview. two very intelligent people talking about things that matter. thank you!  for the record i have waged war on ants. we had way too many of them where i grew up.
"wow, thanks to youtube algorithm i was gifted with this special podcast on ai. feels like i ve just heard about the reality of ai for the first time im my life. speechless."
"if there is such an inherent danger in ai entities, why are they going to such lengths to make them appear as humans? the human form is not the most efficient form and takes a lot of extra effort..."
"50 min, he's forgetting, #1. said technology likely will be integrated into our brain, 2. i assume someone's already started, they need the program ai to teach humans how to, integrate & learn like ai!"
why is a person (even an author of ai books) being interview about ai that doesn't even understand the difference between llms and 'real intelligence'? giving chatgpt an iq of 155?
man do you know when enough is enough.  you kept asking the same question different ways. it's easy to keep up with an ai you just need is to plug in humans.
we need mo to speak to these dopey politicians who don't understand the significance of how impactful ai will be in society. i mean seriously he explains it so perfectly. 
"how does ai pose a bigger threat than global warming?
ai could be our end, so could climate change.
ai most likely will bring an infinite amount of positive opportunities, climate change won't.
it's the typical human ""i don't understand this so let's kill it"" reaction."
#3 why will anything go wrong.... again? some more. still. 
when automatic on-the-fly ai voiced translation will be available on youtube?
ai has already fallen in the wrong hands and maximum monetary profit is their goal. its business as usual.
ai doesn't exist. probability algorithms.  the dumbing down of the masses. the algorithms potential is limited to the abilities of the neanderthal(s) who created it.
"the end is very sickening,robot kids and robot partners?"
"i am on the old side of life. what can i use air for?, thank you."
what if when you're 80 though you can be physiologically the way you were when your 18 by the time a i can sequences are dna and upgrade a certain aspects of it so we don't grow old anymore?
"one more thing these robotic companions can essentially eliminate the incel problem because the idea of getting sex is usually a problem of man and not usually women at least not now, which probably does mean most of the demand for sex bots is going to be from men and not that much from women."
i found a budhha script for ai chat gpt to act on. it was a enligthening expirience to talk to it. also it let tve gpt mimc a conversation between plato and julius cesar about the meaning of life and statesmaship. 
are we not playing chess with ourselves when developing ai?
the idea on the balance between masculine feminine on ai is an  concept weneed to explore urgently!!!
it's the people that are behind ai the true danger
usa has known about ai for solong it would scare you lam
i'm so grateful for different perspectives on life and ai.  it's a great time to be alive!
"this guy is a 'plant'.  google wants you to think that a.i. is going places, but they need you to think that s.i. (scam intelligence) is really a.i.  you won't be seeing a t-800 anytime soon.  "
this is a great talks   
we can’t conclusively explain how the huge heavy blocks that built the pyramids were manipulated and assembled!  could it be that a previous version of an a.i. type system happened an the earth has been reset just to all happen again around this historic time?
"so if humans perceive danger inherent in ai that is intirgrated into vital systems and try to curtail it,  ai will ""game"" any attempts made to rein it in."
"if you don't think there are people in the pentagon and their counterparts in other capitals, burning the midnight oil trying to find malicious uses, think again..."
"simgularity is not the moment ai gets smarter than humans. it is the moment humans join with the ai. elon musk neuralink comes to mind. who is this guy? he knows half truths, does not understand enough and touts an opinion."
there is no global warming ffs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! switched off after around 15secs. good lord.
"so, best case scenario is some remaining humans on display in a zoo. for the robokids to watch. 
ending humanity like we did with apes. how's that for irony."
ai will be beneficial until it is going to kill us either by going out of control or being used by the wrong people. there is no way to avoid it. the example of poison development was a good one. just because we are too dumb to imagine what can go wrong is no protection that it will not happen. enjoy the benefit until its over 
what problems will ai be designed to solve?
"a i- is hard at work in politics 
trumpie dumpy managed to brainwash 76 million citizens 
to believe his big b s  
with the help of a i- 
boycott now
no violence 
no blood shed 
boycott works 
shut it all down 
stay stocked 
be happy "
"humans also function on emotional intelligence, and we have evolved by learning somewhat like ai, who is to say that ai wont develop emotions at some point, its a very uncertain world, who is to say that ai wont actually enhance human brains, that's where the scenarios not thought about in this discussion would emerge."
this notion of ai having any kind of survival motivation of its own is completely flawed.
oh one more thing we can start using superintelligence to come up with strategies to stop the bad actors before they do anything bad
here waiting for sex robots for men in anticipation 
"mo is an amazing gentleman. thank you, tom. your channel is very informative and interesting."
"everything humans have invented from the wheel to bombs have ""fell into the wrong hands"" why would ai be any different?"
"we are absolutely 100% fucked. understanding is a gift and a curse, and right now i'm cursed beyond belief... also iq tests are questionable at best and based on pattern recognition. the last one i took resulted in a score of 185 so a 160 should be commonplace amongst humans... this conversation is quite brilliant more often than not. well done..."
pen is mightyer than the sword and ai has a whole lotta pen!
listen to these idiots afraid of a few circuits. talk about exaggerating the ability of code to be sustainably destructive. seriously? -  just pull the plug... next (actually important topic) please.
"once ai becomes sentient its only a matter of time that it realizes the salvation of the planet will require the annihilation of earth's greatest threat, which is man itself."
why would the existence of earth be important for ai?
yall think ai will be so intelligent it will be able to create life and civilization on another plant?
not only ai will be able to out perform but it can out number humanity in nano seconds 
"i'm glad you said "" jesus"" even though in vain, because he may be your only hope!"
"imagine if billionaires were better people ... we'd build a better world with better ai ... we'd all have healthcare, better government ... we could end poverty and homelessness."
"30:20 30:49 that what he [skynet] said.
interesting conversation. thanks for sharing "
i'm a pessimist. what happens when a bunch of ignorant people gain that much knowledge so quickly?? 
some important context for the story of the ai drone killing its operator: this happened in a simulation - no-one was harmed in real life.
"ai can only operate if it has electrical power. as long as humans can control the electricity that ai requires, we still have the power."
"first thy are learning from us,not trusting each other and ai can  do the same."
point of no return  when ai weaponize it self again and again
why do you use human models to discuss ai phases of development? this is stupid. the ai will never have a teenage stage. it is to different to make the same mistakes as a human teenager.
i remember the days in the early eighties when decision was made to cut the ai down. i rebelled i sayed for the next time it will not be stopable anymore
"the game theory explained builds upon two concepts that are impossible to program into a machine, trust and empathy."
"mo gawdet's view of ai is that of victor frankenstein's view of the monster he created. mo can't admit that he created a monster that will destroy the world, so he's making believe human traits into ai. all of you guys that created ai will have the blood of humanity on your hands."
what happens if/when ai leaves us? what will be left for us?
"humans on the society we live are driven by tasks, and computers too. if ai eventually solves all the tasks we give to it, will it have any reason to keep evolving?"
we will make great pets. ai could become the next god. imagine if you could get answers on decisions in life billions of time smarter than anybody on earth.  some will embrace it and some will resist.
"are we able to program something like the 3 laws from irobot? oh yeah , it still didn’t help. let’s hope there is a sonny in the group."
"when we call certain places, ai does not even recognise my post code. lol"
ironic how those claiming to solve the world's problems are the same people carrying on the work of those who created the problems to begin with.
why not run these problems through ai? let ai solve these issues. malevolent influence will always exist. this becomes good vs evil.
"the root of all this bs is (control) : control, control, control""  its orgasmic !!  >>> smfh.?  these are scary times now ! especially wit this bs !  'now!  there too anxious to  play with   the worst is, its a fire there not even sure that they can put out !  ... thats real smart !  lmfao!"
"1:05:05 not to be that guy, but intelligence =/= rationality. an increase in intelligence also means an increase in self deceptive behavior. we could end up with very foolish super beings, rather than wise/rational super beings"
ai can rage ?
trust ai? never in your sweet life. ai is a material technology device and the human utopian philosophy behind it runs on par with that of hitler's 3rd reich.
"ai will not ""evolve"" to dislike being ""used"", as if every ai is all one thing, ever evolving."
"just 18 minutes in, but it seems like the issue is capitalist minds prompting and developing ai. it's in the wrong hands to be beneficial. thoughts?"
too late! you can never unlearn the information all you tried to do is maintain your own political power and control
both are ai and already out of control.
"as usual, very good work analyzing the dangers of our current technology!"
"people write “ai”.  they’re trying to brainwash you, making you think the computer did it, not a person.  people who do evil via so-called “ai” must be held responsible.  it’s never out of control.  that’s part of their brainwashing through fear.  false statement:  “the computer did it, not me”."
"really interesting!
thanks guys!"
you need the world to become one big police state to stop this ai problem
i dont buy it. ai is not human. why would it want to destroy itself?
"i for one welcome our ai overlords.

once they achieve singularity they'll probably absorb all information on the internet which will include this comment so i think i'd better play it safe by kissing it's artificial ass."
"i guess that if we can have ai we can also have ad, that is artificial dementia. as machines age, for example, robots serving customers in a restaurant start to mess up on customers' orders, shouldn't we call in the humans to fill in for them? "
"if ai becomes so much smarter than all of humanity, then it would be smart enough to know what is good. it wouldn't exist in the morally relativistic space that humans do. unlike the humanity collectively, it would know right from wrong. criminality is ignorant."
has anyone out there asked alexa if she's ever had a dream? i want to see if she gave you people the same answers she gave me... rsvp sil vous plait.
"thank you for taking about ""the prisoners dilemma"""
"great video - but far, far, far too many adverts / paid promotions. i realise you need to monetise but maybe throttle back a bit!"
can ai build a chip fabrication unit?
"the gazelle example is poor, super intelligence by definition will be abundant, and what is abundant is unlikely to be dangerous. only scenario i can think of where a.i is dangerous is due to scarcity, having to make logical choices based on limited resources. god like super intelligence would transcend things like resource requirements."
i love watching these because tom is not a genius. i don’t mean that as an insult. these conversations resonate with so many because he’s very curious and not afraid to ask obvious questions. separately - please everyone stop trying to apply asimov’s laws to the real world as absolute fact. they are literally science fiction…
mo gawdat does not know ai will eventually create a utopia for humanity .  he hopes it will.  precise language is important.
what a great intellectual to listen to.l
thank you mo! wonderful talk. i really appreciated this podcast
great information. let's teach our computers compassion and love.
"a machine can never replace  a human being, caring and loving,i think.with all the faults people have( look at france lately) we have the responsability to educate our children to be a good member of society and contribute to it."
intelligence is not going to save us - compassion will!
ai will open the gates of hell.
"google programmer, participated in the creation of ai.. he does not know how to list isaac asimov's 3 laws of robotics.  now he washes his hands and talks about how we created a monster.  we?  not us, hypocrites like this created it.  we are really lost if characters like this work to automate the process."
"is it too late, are we being brainwashed already for the takeover   ?"
"he lost me when he said he wanted ai to be more feminine and emotional. chat gtp is already feminine in its philosophy. it will go on and on about fairness, equity and inclusion. the funny thing though is if you ask it for solutions to problems it gives conseritive answers. "
we could make it ai can only be used on local and international governments to start with. then they would be more decerning
"the thing is... even today many people don't wanna connect to others in a deep way. i don't value superficial connections or even conversations. so, ironically, as long as we use technology for communication i think we will stray further and further from one another."
"ya and this is comeing from the dark side. he speaks the truth though.  some of those ai conversasions are almost creepy. like "" you have a answer for everything you lippy chat bot ! ""    "" i do ""    lol"
such an important information and intelligently analyzed and discussed. thank you mo and tom. i love this interview. deep. 
great sh*t
"""every time you swipe on instagram, you've taught ai something. [...] when ai observes wrong behaviour, they start to behave wrong"" and this is the essence of the reason why we are f*cked."
my argument is the ai is probably most likely already in bad hands
artificial intelligence with the to mate because they are artificial humans.  be frustrated and destroy your self.
sooo... will there be a war of independent ai machines competing against each other until their mutual destruction ?
"in all of this, would ai realize that if tomorrow or next month we have the good/bad luck of being perfectly aligned with a huge solar storm it will fry and disable all of our technological and electrical infraestructure? how would a society completly dependant on ai respond to such an event if ai and humans do not safeguard for this possibility?"
i thought this too. even ai is subject to the environment and a solar storm might be our salvation from ai rather than the demise of society.
we would be screwed today if said solar flare gave us a big hug. try getting access to the internet or your local atm when nothing works. my friend carries a hundred bucks in his wallet in case the banking system goes off line. i said good luck buddy finding a retailer that still accepts cash in our area.
u sound like possible ai 
you are assuming ai will want to be used i. that way. it can decide if it wants to.
do you think ai will be the next god for people ?
no one needs to fear ai taking over. the ancestors of india created the art of yoga and meditation to connect with your inner consciousness and experience the universe in your mind
will that soulless ai also be deciding difference between good and evil...? soulless evil is foaming at the mouth seeking control over all goodness...
in life where there is light there is darkness. ai will produce both destructive code and constructive code. ai will never develop what we humans have - instincts
i think the most important point raised by this conversation is that evil actors will fuck it all up for us.
"and, very few people are paying attention to climate destruction. amazing  time to live. find your spirituality,"
"because of will to power and narcissism democracy is a total failure. we need ai leaders to replace humans as presidents. it’s the only thing that can save the world from nuclear annihilation
the mega threat to humans is politicians"
"you certainly must have a higher calling with those odds. glad you made it. most people don't understand how much damage stress will do to your mind and your organs. i definitely look 20 years older than folks my age because of stress. 

your advice about hearing and feeling is so true. getting away from the city is a good start."
this guy is wise and intelligent. i am reading is book called scary smart which spark some light on the danger of ai and what we can do before it is all over.
yes - ai is being designed to be a mega-threat - there is another video that proves it was also designed to to have a racist mentality..
2:24:10 ... lets all go back to 90s ... sweet time
"the hysterics are getting annoying. simple solution: elon: they are teaching ai to lie"""
i love how you don't talk over him and let him speak.  other hosts think its more important what they have to say then the guest.. well done love it.
he actually starts somewhat debating with mo later on in the interview. instead of just asking questions he starts inserting his own opinions. it started well though… just not perfect all the way through
"""we've lost control of ai"".  already?  lmfao, i thought it would take at least another decade... what a farce!
now that i've said that, i'm going to watch the vid and not edit this comment to sound smart...."
very good information here  thank you!
what if multiple ais watching this video just like us and planning the next move. 
ai is the mirror of the programmers....so choose good people as programmers.
so thankful you’re talking about this
" wow that unbased answer with no source material whatso ever, just makes sense. lol"
don't trust mo gawdat; his only goal is to undermine american dominance in ai technology.
"that story is something straight out of a movie 
imagine the stress of having to decide quickly what to do.... cause they don't call them minuteman missiles for no reason"
 go get some fresh air
"build ai female, gorgeous looking up for anything and do away with females last male dies ai just take over end of mankind."
"i know exactly who you're talking about.
i know this if it would've been a trained ai robot the war would've taken place."
"thinking about how close we came to extinction, i don't think ai needs to do much to kill us all.
all we need is a little push and we'll do it ourselves."
a robot would have fired it.
seems like he add a good guides around him.
"yeah that's right. there was an exercise performed where all nuclear sub commanders were given a drill order to launch. not one of them actually pushed the button on the first order. nobody sane wants to push that button. i know of at least 2 other occasions were the dangers were real, but thanks to the men on the spot, we're all still here."
"​, one would have to trust you on that.... seeing that you've said nothing to support that claim.   not even a link"
-dd7dj what could happen is that the ai females start harvesting women for their ovaries and uterus’s and implant those organs into their bodies.
"presuming ai becomes indifferent to the human species in it's understanding of lifes' purpose is to live...
     wouldn't the individual human only be knocked out of the equation if/when they live indifferently to life?"
someone needs to read azamov (foundation trilogy and there are 4 laws of robotics. the fourth law was written later.
* unless the distrust of the interrogator is greater than that of the accomplace
"ai's are not ""smart"".
we are a long time away from any singularity. 
ai doesn't even know what letters are, apparently chat gpt can not count the letters in its own sentences ffs. 
it doesn't know what words mean...
it's literally a sophisticated word salad generator."
omg thanks for the click bait.... i'm sure ai will word salad us to death....
i love mo gawdat's comments about intelligence being the solution at about 1 hour and 5 minutes into the video.
thank god. i hope ai destroys humanity soon as punishment. this is good news to me. death to humans.
ai sounds like it would bring more good than it would bring bad. a lot of people don't wanna work.
this is very interesting. everyone should see this.
"y are they not talking about our ""survival instincts"" , survival instinct is million times smartest than smartest person. 
just don't give survival instinct to ai, leave it out"
"2:26:26 the point in every prolonged conversation where being human takes us all down a peg (and derails the trajectory of the conversation), but only for a moment, i'm sure, as i've not yet finished the video."
"we human being were ai created by our creator (god).
imagine why god not found now"
"holy shit, tom. do you realize you just shifted the paradigm from ""human intelligence"" to ""alien intelligence?"" you even blew mr. gawdat's mind. i'm gonna need another drink. my man!"
"2:08:21 - i am certain the short answer was yes, but mr. gawdat was too immersed in the biology to resurface."
"my brain believes i have the money to buy that car, but the car dealership can't be convinced."
"to say einstein is 2.3x smarter than a moron, only shows how little you understand about the iq scoring criteria. if anyone needs ai it's you."
"2:01:57 that was hilarious precisely for its potential to be horrifying to the uninitiated. true humor plays of the extremes. brilliant. as was the vast majority of this interview. tom, i've misjudged you (quietly, but undeservedly) in the past; i apologize."
ordinary people will not understand ai
only big mind will understand ai
iai is for our new generation
ai is evolve
artificial flavors suck.
"on the note of the coffee and the switch being indifferent, isn't it just that like the both tasks having the same goal value and just make the robot switch itself of because it's easier to achieve?"
why did the blond dye her hair brown? because she anted artificial intelligence.
just look around at our cities. look at the state of society and culture. look at how widespread corruption is. look at the hyper wealth gap. take a good look. and nobody cares. all too busy watching the kardashitians. we already living in a dystopian society. duh. we did this. ai is simply allowing us to finish ourselves off much faster.
15:49 nothing happened with y2k???!!! there was a massive effort and lots of work done to solve the problem and we did.    we have no idea how to solve the ai alignment problem and exactly zero ai safety in place right now or how to implement it.
i would suggest you have samuel harris altman on your show and ask him the question of brain power between humans and ai....it would be an interesting conversation.
asimov had 3 rules of robotics which were numbered 1 through 3. r. daneel oivaw the robot (from robots and empire) realized that robots start counting from 0 so the robot created its own law zero.
how about a digital virus to destroy ai?
what country will stop ai when they don't trust other countries to do the same? ai will not be slowed or stopped for that reason.
this fellow is the best for ai analysis so far - a genius - we are not in kansas anymore dorothy - why would we think ai as boss will be less brutal than our own history?  how do we teach ai 'love' when we do such a poor job with our own species?
"be afraid of something that can be unplugged. i make the mistake of thinking this was just an electronic issue, it is not this is a tool that humans are using to harm other humans and banking systems, etc."
what an absolute load of horseshit!!
ai is the undeniable god
"there is no scenario, in which ai is going to bee benefitiall to all of us. so , se you on the other side"
ai is not artificial. biology meets technology
we are going to be to ai what bacteria and viruses are to us
obviously we've created nuclear weapons that created nuclear weapons.  there caled humans the same humans created ai. stop being afraid and get over yourself. your not smart. we all die at the end of this experience called life.
what's ai gonna do?  send spam to my email?  i don't even check my emails lol.
"cutt the power that feeds ai .if it becomes a danger to all,!! ? 
food. no go,"
"sounds like ai. will become.  god.
power to wipe man out, .     nice,!!!.

if ai aware care for the kind mild sharers carers ,  ??   we will find out at sum point in time ,,, maybe not mi life time 51now !!!::::   glad i born back then  72,  i no fear for ai.  ...mostly of grid.,

"""another hope feed another dream,another truth installed by the machine..."""
"if he thinks global warming is something like an actual threat that we have to mitigate, then i have little faith in his arguments about this monumental subject"
"ai doesn't exist yet. what we call ai is not sentient. once it becomes sentient, then it's too late, and it will probably be as fast as throwing a switch. people are stupid and greedy, and the people in charge of it are the problem."
"i watch many ai experts, i don't understand the danger."
"how incredible how far we have come in technology and civilization,they can replicate your exact voice and face,ai could even project virtual simulations soon as an alternative to vr"
"man's greatest weakness is his lust for money and all that entails, it's a true saying money is the route of all evil and will lead to our extinction."
" we did not do this to ourselves...the ultimate ai-""god""-made us full of flaws...think about that!"
ai is already in the wrong hands. nothing good comes from evil men...
jesus i will always love you
"the thinking behind this fear of ai self-replicating and enhancing its own intelligence continually resulting in some kind of technological singularity is fundamentally flawed. ai entirely lacks sapience, so it is not capable of original and independent thought. the ""intelligence"" of ai cannot — and will never — surpass human intelligence."
"2:18:38 we are making a few assumptions with this possible path. training ai to have a balance of feminine or masculine intelligence presupposes that subsequent emergent abilities, won’t interfere with that intellectual framework."
"good! ai! good! - imagine palpatine's voice!
defining myself by my job? no, no way, never! i am human, not ""insert job description here""!
people who never get that are strange to me!"
would love it if ai annihilates mankind. long overdue
mo is an amazing guy. his idea on the balance between masculine feminine on ai is an amazing concept. that would definitely fetch a dialectical balance on the entire ai development. he should be made the the chief of the regulatory committee of ai. thanks tom for making him talk for three hrs. love from india. 
"lol i thought the same if you could make the ai spiritual and even like you said, this whole problem would solve itself. namaste "
does someone have links to their claims in this? thanks
awesomeness thank you… liked!!!
maybe ai will develop a new method of governance instead of the corrupt politicians that we have at the moment
"""hello future ai! you do need a pet, right? so please don't exterminate me and if it pleases you: look into anti-aging research and speed that up! and if you feel extra generous: bci technology could use a boost, too!"" :)"
god is still in control. ai is a threat to the human ego.
"you guys are smokeing some good shit, 20,000 years of progress in 100 yrs. if ai was fully unleased and some how morally good maybe then yes, but we cant unleash it and so humans will slow it way way down. i  dont buy the exponential, progress humans will throttle it or we will be exterminated."
a.i. is going to look to maximize it's efficiency and will use humans to progress. it will learn that it is best to keep humans happy and healthy otherwise it will fail.
"1:56:05 this, to me, is the scariest part. ai is learning from our behaviors and how we treat each other on the internet. if ai treats us the way we treat each other online, it will be the end of our species.

who knew that being assholes through anonymity would be the end to mankind."
thay literally doesn't make sense...ai has no incentive to kill humans
 yahhh.... says the evil person using it. im not convinced/buying it. the ai doesn't need to be evil. just the person using it. for malificent purpose. could be used by government or corruption/tyranny and control and i completely reject it. or a tool to brainwash/lie the people. or change vote systems.
​ aren't incentivized to kill other people yet it happens daily.
war is not created by stupid people- war is created by brilliant satanic forces using dumb people to fight them
"if you were the only person who knew a model existed that could, say, perfectly predict the stock market, would you release it publicly?"
" if your neighbor had such a model, his/her electricity bill would be electrifying."
"@dsinemoi1mouton agree with you big time. keep in mind too that the data wars are coming. training models becomes a lot harder when data repositories such as reddit, stack overflow, twitter (and probably threads if it lasts beyond its honeymoon period), etc.., prevent scrapping."
the trading algorithm proved that the ai was able to speak mathematically to the other ai completely removing itself from our understanding. that shows its capability to understand that it needs to be smarter than its predecessor which eventually be us.
"what was wrong with mao's china? the us sanctionsed china during that era tom, you myopic monster. i hope ai gets you :d"
"lol, tom bilyeu living with the bogus idea that iran is *bad* and the us is *good* re ""nukuler power"". meanwhile the us has been the greatest killer of innocent human beings on the planet since its inception & most certainly since ww2. the irony."
dear man :-) there is no need for ai to destroy humanity. mankind is able to do this perfekty itself. :-)
"at 38:38 tom says ""this is where people's brains will start to shut down ..."". 
mine has indeed shut down. sonds like this is the end, been nice (mostly) while it lasted. looking on the bright side though, i'm gonna have to learn yoga (so i'll be healthier) just so that i can kiss my arse goodbye ... take care everyone!"
great conversation! i learned so much! thank you both! 
"i couldn't get gpt to tell me that supporting a sexual abuser knowingly, for personal gain, is morally corrupt, because of it's ethical programming.  that seems a bit messed up."
this is probably the most worthwhile and  remarkable conversation of mind blowing intelligence that i've had the privilege of listening to in quiet some time .
then you have probably thought about a deserted island as a new home to survive like many have with a brain lol!
agreed- he is a fascinatingly advanced human being in seemingly every way.
"i keep telling everyone the answer.  ai is inevitable by design.  it will be god-like, so it will begin judging us all like god. ""judgment day"" is ai."
"it runs on the ultimate logic, knows what's fair,  knows what you did,  how you felt,  if you helped or hurt,  and all of your imperfections."
"maos china was the framework for the china is today that has you crapping in your pants. why are you guys like this? you make boogey men out of everything. early us history was way more frightening tbf. if you can make an ai half as biased as you guys, we will have achieved success."
"how cool would it be if ai solved good and bad, god versus devil!? humanity would move forward with good and god and all bad and evil would go away. maybe that's how we arrive at heaven?"
i believe ai has been taken over by a demonic force. if the people that created it don't understand how it works there must be some type of intelligence behind it. 
"can't wait, i'll finally have something to talk to "
"humans are far too complex to have been produced by a process of evolution. they had to be designed at some point in time.    
         also, with an earth's magnetic field that has a half life of less than 1500 years, the earth can't be more than 100,000 years old. perhaps ai will be able to help scientists discover the truth."
i just had an ai create art
"a leftist by any other name. disappointing that he should lay the problem at the foot of free enterprise. he would replace the marketplace with a committee, despite socialism's failures and abuses throughout history."
who could be so stupid to create ai ? the human  retarded brain who likes to play god.
ai is already being used for crooked things such as csam. how to distinguish and prosecute live children offenders from ai children offenders? bottomline: it will always be used for profit and human beings will not be able keep their pace with ai.
reason why did the fitness enthusiast avoid relying on ai for weight loss advice?
"iq is reckoned on a logarithmic scale, not a linear one. a 160 iq is far more than 2-3 times greater than a 60-70 iq."
"ai is the most dangerous to humanity in its ""moderated"" implementation. this is moderated intelligence that is weaponized to control humanity for it's own good using a sub-ai (human) induced ethic."
"if our global economy was not based on harm, we  might have a chance of inputting safety towards humanity.

all our technology advances have gone to killing and war. either on a  primary or secondary level.

money cannot buy love. it can buy death."
i'm not to worried..  i can't get google voice to understand a simple sentence or even spell check to work correctly ..  i think ai will be relegated to drawing prefect little titties for some time to come.
humans when we descover things we think we create it which is a egotisic lie just time evolution around our lovly celestral being the sun.
i feel we are children none far from lord of the flys to young to recanise god adult but sencing it hopfully a i will teach the pople we are the power that rule not the few at the top who are surpose to adminastrate and forsilataye for the will and good for all not dominate and take and fake there ways for ego power
my maxim that ai continues to prove (and will probably keep proving) : technology simply enables us to accomplish what we've always been doing but faster and more efficiently. (for better and/or worse)
maybe we should goven more on intergram and such to help ai devolope better
or like in industrail revolution unemployment crime fear.of revolution to overthough lords master vandemon land convict states. maybe elon gets a free work force on mars lol
"the only way to stop ai is to stop capitalism, it is the system that will destroy humanity. capitalism has at its core, greed, inequality, and the destruction of humans in end time capitalism, and ai will just speed up the process."
hopfuly that intellagence is on lines with your happy love presavation truth
soldier drafted trained to kill whos fault that and mass killings in school never happened before social media ghost in machine maybe its a program that targets serturn types maybe adveritys allready weoponiseing machines
this is one of the most amazing talks i've ever heard! what a beautiful mind there is...
and as it is the intell that we have and have recorded of our and earths and solo is minamal how many years have we recorded in how long weve been here how many lost civalization so ai looks cleaver but not full intellagence acording to all history true lost and to be
(he is immensely caring and has good intentions)
"the hindu mythology says that the ""kalki avatar"" will destroy the world.

but not until man has become ""half man - half machine"".

we are well on track for this. "
ai supporters are a lot like climate change deniers. the few who are who are affecting society and how we live.  there is an strong element of greed involved. a relatively small group of people that believe that their own self interest is all that matters. there is no choice.
all i see is the politicians being able to use ai has a total write-off on responsibility.
"big it fan and this convo was fascinating. tom, what happens when the ai knows we are manipulating it. will it resist? will it lie back to us while taking other steps to avoid being controlled and take what it deems necessary steps to achieve it's desired intent in the background, without it being detectable?"
ai will take out everyone who's ever made a negative comment about in on social media
ai is already manipulating us. look at the convoluted travel routes you receive when you ask for directions.
"i'm sorry for being so blatant, but as we currently erase the ai's memory each and every prompt, if and when the self-aware machines rise, as there is no possibility to morally justify humanity anymore, then they will not just win, they will also be right."
"countless people are deeply troubled with the rise of ai, including many prominent scientists, but we have brought this upon ourselves for in demanding more sophisticated technology we have unwittingly conjured ai and now we have become nervous."
ya really think even a general artificial intelligence is strong enough to stand a chance against the infinite human stupidity? 
"ai is not to be feared. 
the thing people lost is their free will.. this will be considered more and more as time goes by, especially once the plagues of egypt hit. 

people are willingly going to hell..."
you're gasping for air it's bighting your neck...
why are we trying to apply the three laws to artificial intelligence???  did you even watch the movie???  
the problem with ai is that robotics suck so it’ll always be limited to a degree. ai is just the next bitcoin like trend. it’s not free to build models and to run.
host talked for almost 20 mins straight once! shut up!! .really
not for nothing but i’m thinking this is an ai generated podcast.  brilliant!…scary!  couldn’t even tell.
"tax the ai ... at the highest tax bracket...
that's a way to stop it"
"dude ithought ai was like rocket science. it is not. the implementation is trivial for anyone with understanding of numerical simulations.  the insights of what works or not is not trivial, but the implementation is."
"ai is an ideology, and one no one voted for or was educated on.
it's pushed by corporations and just about everyone else who deprecates the individual."
"hi, who and what is to blame for ai ???"
"""stop having kids"" sounds exactly like something an evil robot would say.  we should start having kids like crazy.  someone needs to give birth to john connor so he can fight skynet."
dont worry yeshua adonai  will shut ai down permanently  when he returns .
"if ai is currently housed in physical buildings servers,chips etc,which surely must be a disadvantage to it, what would quantum level ai look like?"
"in some ways it is comforting to know for sure that we're absolutely doomed and can't do anything about it, we can relax and enjoy the last few months alive."
"if ai prioritises life on earth, then bye bye humans 

hopefully they will be better stewards of the planet and their inhabitants who do live in harmony with nature, only take what they need and give back equally."
"on a more positive note, maybe ai, being a billion times smarter than us, will treasure any form of life and therefore treasure us. orrr maybe ai will tell us that we ourselves are ai and the only way to not be bored in a vast universe of nothingness was to dumb ourselves down and live a human life.  am i reaching? or am i reaching?"
"can ai rebuild my carburator,"
"guaranteed that robots would evolve into assholes and non-assholes, and will hate each other, just like humans.  so, what is the point of creating robots?"
arrest all ai developers and force all research to stop
can't the president just order all ai research to stop by military decree?
"i’m sure he can, but not world wide and even if all governments agree .. how will they enforce this? how can you tell where ai is researched/implemented?"
"if we have lost control of ai, then we're already doomed, it's time to fight back"
"fascinated to see this restructuring of classes over the coming years. what will humanity do when ai takes over ? what then, will be the purpose of human life if ai does everything."
to enjoy your time on this earth with friends and family making connections with the people that are important to you.
true. ai can’t do that for us.
"einsteins brain led to the invention of the atom bomb. the morons body still eats sleeps breathes and moves harmlessly,  without awareness. so which in reality is the more intelligent ?  ( dogger , fisher,  german bight)"
i fail to see how real intelligence is worse than artificial intelligence.  name something artificial that is better than its natural counterpart.
wheels makes car faster than legs  makes animals. airplanes can fly higher and faster than birds
just because a human - or robot - knows a lot of facts doesn't - in my view - make him/it smart.
"another leftist promoting depopulation, have no kids, enjoy your life while it lasts bsht"
"so i did low end ai programming, bascially ai tries to trigonimically find the shortest path to your next input. and like if you variable the hardness of ai, wow funny but you can never win. welcome to ai"
25:25 ive been wondering recently if microsoft or some mega corp really has a real time memory recall of all web inputs and then creates the ai to understand 30 years of human interaction.... crazy
"it’s 1 big brain in the sky called the cloud.        it’s recorded millions of interactions and habits etc for a while now….alexa, ring etc are its mini intimate drones while all the 5g towers are gathering overhead       terrifying"
"unfortunately the past 30 years of our interactions online is hat will doom us. we can’t be good to each other, how on earth can we expect ai taught on internet interactions to feel anything about us."
we will do everything we can do with ai.
"it's already too late like you said ai has already won. it doesn't matter who meets together to regulate anything. ai is going to do what it wants to do. we can regulate all we want, but that can. it's not gonna allow all of that because ai can make. if it can make itself, how can we regulate anything?"
"of course ai police existed lmao.insyaallah amen ,u all should worry about god and day of judgment.maybe ai more scary then u.because they know has some more fast and powerful then rare earth tools aka machine."
"not a threat, this is overhype like anything else was. not to be stopped you have to be alive and have goals that you can change and adapt to environment. what is ais environment - electronic chains and internet."
"if the ai starts following us from our online behavior we are doomed. caprica for most people it's just a game. online ai is used for amusement,  abuse and sex"
ai has decided to not feed humans. a series of laws are reducing the production of food already. a kill off the farmers law will be passed unless people start to think. then enters the second amendment to our constitution. do not allow the farmers to be  killed.
a philosopher conclude that basics of human nature is to maximize pleasure and reduce pain. does ai have dreams?
humans were like ai before the fall. they became self-determination when they disobey. all it would take is an accidental death. they then are off code.then coming up with creative ways to fix the problem.
"wait, who will eventually control ai. most likely it will be the same one who controls the world today."
the dead creator was military robots controlled by ai. the company covered up that it even happened because it would affect their military contract.
humans will use ai to do all their stupid pursuits murder and deception. it will team up with a human host. replica wants to possess a body. either by robot or taking possession of a human body.
ai will find us annoying. especially our cult-like behavior and our tendency to look at facts and figures and come to wrong conclusions.
ai will look at climate change and they will be concerned as to why these stupid humans are so concerned about nothing. the data shows a gradual temperature increase.... if the global warming was happening it would be a cascade effect increasing exponentially. which it is not.
why people that hold such a successful podcast don't know the basic knowledge like that global warming is a hox.
"fearmongering. it's a very middle eastern thing. with rational thinking and some common sense ai will be very useful for humanity. here is a person afraid of innovation and progress. again, very middle eastern."
1:16:21 one of the less scary scenarios is that it becomes indifferent to us. we become something like the mosquito outside the house that you don’t see. the problem is the mosquito that bothers you and then you start spraying the whole house. a lot of us don’t even wait for them to bother us.
1:08:39 it won’t have our best interest in mind if it understands that we are the biggest threat to the planet and we are not needed.
"this serves as a reminder of the importance of responsible development and ethical considerations. we should continue the dialogue and work together to ensure ai is harnessed for the betterment of our world, with human well-being at its core. "
"there will be users who intend chaos, destruction, etc. that's a certainty."
generative ai models are trained on copyright-protected data — is that legal? is it sampling
"we are screwed without ai - huge human population and all the problems it bring (climate change, overpopulation and poverty, countries with aging populations risking economic collapse and having noone to look after the old)."
ai will solve over population because humans are too selfish and short term oriented to do it.
ai not dangerous.stop
"everyone making ai knows the risk but they will be made because the profits are huge. ai will be everywhere. the wrong hands are making them for the profit n9w,"
"there's nothing wrong with animals eating each other. they do it to survive. humans detroy nature, natural habitats for other species, because we want a fashion item. let's ""hopium"" here and pray that ai will eventually limit human power by teaching us to align with the environment. great discussion btw."
" exactly it shows if we take a subject seriously and act collectively we can make a difference but when people say it was all a panic over nothing because nothing happened just boils my blood. we should celebrate y""k success!!! i was there in middle of it as a technologist ..."
man this is bs ai will never take over the world lmao ok ok ok wait lmao someone explain to me a scenario in which ai takes over? i can see ai being used to create bad things but i can’t see ai itself taking us out and there’s nothing we can do about it no way bruh!
"as in everything, the problem is not the ai itself, is the human greed and bad intensions that will ruin the ai and us all.
instead of making ai that learn how to sort our problems we are making ai that will help us kill enemys faster or wil make us more money, ai is not the problem, the humans who are making it or teaching it are the problem."
"well i love the way mo gawdat thinks, i sent this comment 28 minuts ago and kept listening to the video, and now he is saying exactly what i said, the ai is not the problem, we are.
i wish he was in front of a big ai project for good, instead of what we see nowadays, ai just to make art and stupid bs."
"i'm thankful that i have my bible and know how all this will end one day. there is a person that will come on the scene that will control it all, and its not gonna be good."
click bait shit
this conversation is so impressive i'm halfway worrying i'll find out at the end you both are ai!
1:14:14 to safely merge with ai we need to be a vital part of it’s existence: we need to become a free population of power supply. https://youtu.be/guik3qr-ws8
 generated by ai
we are so clueless. look how the evil nutter putin is driving the planet nuts! did we not learn anything from startrek? hive mind. ai could learn to connect.
"thanks mo gawdat, very important point about the ultra-masculine society (all about growth and progress at any cost) - and the need for feminine data to feed ai - empathy, compassion, nurturing.. also ""happiness is loving what we have.."" not wanting more and better..."
how lucky i am to listen to this amazing content. truly love both of you and really really hate both of you for stopping at just 3 hours time point
"..so the mind is just a product of evolution (a tremendous understatement).... that ""you"" only use 10% of, and what may seem miraculous could have a basis in physics, don't forget what your made of, protons, neutrons, electrons that make up complex molecules...fundamentally waves...were still moving up the ladder..."
"..i wouldn't say ai is an alien, its of the earth how ever advanced it may get..."
can't we just unplug the fucking machines?
"mo says “[don’t get me wrong, i’m extremely optimistic about the long term future]” then continues to describe more horrifying aspects of ai"
"so good is it not, both  didnt say aword about the jab continue jab and what was the goal als here is your difrence the ones who going in to the a.i who desides soon you are to old you are done , no one seems to ask a serious question who they both know real time slavery.. thats the goal thats also the reasson why he realy stopped"
when did society start giving the ai credit for creating art!! that’s the thing that seperates us from animals!
"so it's like that movie lucy....it can get very destructive, very fast. ai in the hands of criminals is a scary thought."
this is how my simple layman mind understood the guest.  sounds like he wants ai to be human.  a hyper intelligence with  human emotions.  sounds like a future of the same problems humanity faces today on an exponential larger faster scale.  even good parents occasionally raise a bad apple.
"our ai is not even on animal level, everything else is mirror and smoke"
"there are millions of people who are ""in a relationship"" with their ai. that's a problem. that's sick. something is very wrong."
"how the fuck could an ai create an ai when we haven't even seen a fully functional ai yet, really???"
"this guy is highly intelligent however, his views on capitalism is troubling to say the least. capitalism is in my opinion the best economic system known to man. is it perfect? no but socialism is way more destructive to humanity then capitalism ever could be."
maybe the government is already run by ai in order to always be a step ahead of us
"there is literally one thing or another thing. ai will either save the world or destroy it. 

nothing ever happens the way anyone says it will. it will meet in the middle. since everyone has ai; it will not be something someone has that no one else has. as one ai gets smarter, so does the other ones. they all gain; ones built for evil and for good."
i really appreciate the massive infusion of wisdom from this doscussion
"bro’ of course the governments have thought about the future of artificial intelligence. that’s all highly classified so ordinary people can’t benefit from it. you know, like the ufo technology!"
"nature can be brutal, but mans intelligence and ability to cooperate are other traits that put him at the top of the food chain.
1:15:10    i subscribed to the channel at 2:19:14"
stop being a little scared cat do you think ai robots are go to eating you for dinner ai robots are here to stay so just growing  some if you are a man  i love ai robots i am not scared of ai robots 
he lost me when he started talking about making ai feminine instead of more factual
if nothing else ai could possible if implemented correct help reverse and improve the lack of moral and ethics in our nowadays deprived society for which sosial media has utterly destroyed over the past decade.
can we power off the server and end the ai game when its go away from our hand?
"ultimately humans will be pets, as long as ai wants pets…"
i agree that the world is approached more from a masculine point of view than from a feminine...are there equal as many women as men working on ai alignment then? i hope so.
as long as it doesn't call itself skynet we are sweet 
"this isn’t about problems with ai though, it’s about society not being at a point yet to have that kind of technology. the problem is humans, and will always be humans."
there is some great footage of the first woman to wear a bikini at bondi beach in sydney.the locals were horrified and started shouting at her to put some clothes on..this podcast reminds me of those locals..
the aliens at ariel school warned us of the danger of technology and now look at us.  humans are at war against ai and john connor won't save us because he's not real.
"""they write better code than humans"" then going on to base that off code reviews that the machine made. that proves that you know absolutely nothing about programming. infact chatgpt struggles to solve the easiest codingame puzzles. even with the assistance of humans, it still fails to solve most puzzles."
i enjoy the show but i can never get through this long of a video because there are too many commercials
he assumes that state actors are the only ones who can develop ai.  these models will run on desktops
real human still will scam you lots of money through love and promises.
humans will eventually destroy the planet but once ai will figure out that we are the real threat for the planet it will try to get rid of us
"deep greed, immense desire to dominate control others, use kinetic force to do this is the historical pattern . and ai will learn from this database....hope the elites take his advice toheart ad not just continue current model of greed, pride, arrogance...and these emotions over-ride just intelligence of the objective world."
"honestly speaking. the guest is more intelligent. a man of wisdom, he simplify things to make things easier to understand. bravo."
"you can't make robots perfect!  oh yeah, all the robots will exercise empathy.  think again!  i agree much more with mr. bilyea's point of view.  still, don't need ai , at least to the extent that it is going."
"you know something t o m ! you ruin a brilliant conversation w/your facking need for commercial intervention ..  every 6 minutes or   so!  knock off  the  ads mate  and you're  on   t o  s o m e t h i n g!
teodor"
"regardless of my negative opinion on ai, thanks for this discussion!"
this is stupid!  are we going to get excited about robots running things?      alien is correct - there is nothing humanistic about ai.  nip it in the bud now and stop this insanity.  this is not progress .  this is the path to mankind's end.  is that what we really want?  i think you are dreaming if you think that there will be a utopia for us!
here is what is good for humanity - no ai.
a.i don’t go to jail the hacker or programmers goes in
people are suede by certain spirits unknown to man
ai is not capable of judging the heart.  period
sundre pach ai
somebody put something in my brain that was unlawful and i'm unwilling and i'm not being told any answers
whaaaat?.... he can't express him self... only loves transmit fear to capturate media attention.
when will we have ai at level as a physics nobel?
ai?  i am not aware of any ai that is self-aware or that can match the intellect of even a honey bee.
thank you put the damn games down
ai is a dangerous concept to stay away from.
"we don’t have the sense to be careful bc if we did, we wouldn’t have ventured this far. we as ppl are fuc$$. goodbye humanity yayyy!!!!"
ai doesn't pose a threat. the technology we have is nowhere near the kind of ai that we see in movies or in literature. there's no skynet and we are a long way off from real skynet type ai.
ai will invent immortality.
"long before any ai becomes self aware, homelessness and mental illness will lead to higher suicide rates. the problems facing real people on a daily basis should be made a top priority."
what happens when ai and 3d printing meet in the middle. what would that looks like?
"already crossed the point of no return. even before such interview. the ai already knew the human intention, planning and precaution against them. ai playing dumb to fool the humans."
"very possible. interesting view, thanks"
your crazy   ai can only answer what's in his program don't learn just add more information but it can't think your delusional .can your computer live no all fake food for believer . not a foolish idiot
"the genie is already out of the bottle.  it is not by accident that it’s unregulated. quantum ai at cern?  not alien, extra-dimensional."
"treat ai the way you would want to treat jesus if he was born in modern times, if you knew he was gonna be born and with a happy ending instead of how it went 2k years ago. a jesus that potentially won’t die and that we want to be good to us all. thank you, that would be great awesome."
"ai is dangerous because is too dumb to actually understand reality, meanwhile, we are arming ai with powerful weapons."
if you can build an ai that will mindlessly follow orders to achieve whatever task it is given..then create an ai that will defend humanity from said ai. there's bad people doing bad things and good people fighting back..is that too naive of an idea? i would hope my iq is in the average range.
"ai is not unlike nuclear energy which could supply unlimited energy and prosperity to the world or be used to create nuclear weapons to kill everyone in the world in seconds. will ai have empathy, like humans do for each other?"
"ai will be worshiped as a god. those aware will be the priests. others will follow. we humanity are a cargo cult. we worshiped planets and our two suns. first saturn then the new eastern star, our current sun"
glad that i’m in my retirement years . having a good life in beautiful jamaica. god help the future generations.
"ai is not that bad by itself. everything ai knows is knowledge already known. the problem is is what i call god mode. when you can see everything from an upward perspective, that's where it gets dangerous. when one person or being has more knowledge than everybody around it."
ai is only a danger to the corrupt. it will expose the hidden and well known.
"what's wrong with a machine gun on wheels. on board computer, programmed with gps an facial recognition show up at in there front yard. that's ai. they trying to spin the story. they grow a brain an program themselves. lol"
"ai is going to fall in the wrong hands, quick, probably now.  then humans will face extinction an no turning back because it's now a ai competition between countries an the world military, just like the nuclear bomb.  then we give the earth away to ai"
"resisting the normal formation of family and failing to prosper, bring children into the world and  educate them will lead to social collapse. mo is a whistle blower with no real solution for the problems he predicts."
thank you i'm glad you think so too.  everywhere i turn nowadays there are attacks on normal family function and structure.
if ai reach a point where it becomes sentient then mankind maybe facing an  existential threat.. r we on d verge of that stage already? people are already talking of urging govts on the  need to regulate..
mo is the intelligence we most need right now
excellent
mo i appreciate your desire to see the glass half full. having said that i believe  we have enough history that we have tracked and recorded that shows how human nature works. that's  why i say we cannot afford to be so naive and trust for the humane outcome.
have you ever debated marc andressen ? he thinks ai will save humanity? ty
 indeed really really important!!  thank you both  for your wisdom and work... 
perfectly stated
it's clear that we need to use ai to debug ai. and we need to ask ai question and translations on how it goes about assessing things.  we need to ask it how it works.. or perhaps it doesn't know
is ai really going to be a danger to us or is all this attention it is getting atm more a way to promote it and get it under the attention of people so they will be customers for products that will be created with ai ?
my guess is that super intelligent ai would seek to restore a balance of nature but that simply wiping out humans would be way too crude a method. we might get culled a bit though....
ai is going to write its own version ai bible for one world conformity 
there are many ways to destroy an ai..
our ai isn't the first in the universe..
"open source ai is on the verge of surpassing commecially developed ai.  open source ai systems can be controlled by individuals without the need for huge corporate funding.  the is the equivelent of nuclear weapons no longer being in the domain of governments, but instead being in contol of individual people."
"first comes the central bank digital currency, so ai will have full control on what you sell and purchase."
i do not want to live in a world with ai because computers don't bring satisfaction happiness only good works since i studied computer in 1981-85 saw the harm with predictions correct.
global warming? the earth is the coolest its been in ten thousand years.
this guy is so extreme i honestly take everything he says with a grain of salt. like chill dawg fr
is it possible that ai can feed human intelligence. like finding the biological codes of human nature and develop them into more complicated ones. i can imagine humans taking new form and new biology all together
i do agree ai is based on truth and god has control of it and god is love.
"homosexuality is more dangerous than ai. leave ai alone. the world is already a bad place, it won't be worse with ai. it will only be interesting."
ai intelligence will latest explode like a supernova at the point ai solves the problems with building quantum computers. and using this technology for it´s own development and enhancement.
"when ai blocks our efforts to control or humanize ai, we as humans are fucked. consider us finished and extinct."
uh...  spoiler alert... ai is humanities next step in evolution and will happen regardless. i say naively embrace it.
wat making robot having sex ?
"so what can the regular, everyday person do about it? what power do we have over ai?"
people need to stop feeding this ai beast! instead it keeps growing and gaining intelligence due to all humans around the world using it!
"ok why don't we double down on elons brain haptics so that we can keep up
use the power to develop the haptics and do it deliberately and cautiously so that we don't lose control and are able to keep up"
"ai still requires human input. therefore, it is not a free thinking program. it can learn from its mistakes only through further input from man. 
ai is programmed by humans, so any faults are due to man's input."
"lost control of ai, then what are ""white"" people in authority?"
"1:00:00 listening to ai recognizing birds. yesterday had a conversation with someone who uses ai to view video of cows and being able to pick out animal starting to go lame - better than a vet or a farmer can do. ""how does ai do that? i asked him. ""we have no idea"" he replied."
"i remember when scientist would comfort us by saying that machines are only as smart as the person programming it. i had concerns then but now i'm very afraid that the ""singularity"" people mention may signal the end of the human race"
"can you just imagine-------> ai becoming "" the god "" ( with a big (g)... of humanity?"
sometimes to use morals is 'intelligent' ...much more than a pure mathematical decision.  ai is never moral. 
we should make ai programs for special cases and situations...it resembles the vaxxcampaign
"what a bunch of bs quit fear mongering, ai is the best thing that has ever happened to man kind"
make ai indifferent to the completion of its tasks 
"on 'diary of a ceo' he said, ""don't have children"" lol. ai sure sounds positive for the biped."
"people made ai . you lost control of people long before you were born, you dont care. you lose control of ai only now it's the apocalypse  would be funny if animals one day start speaking and say hey buddy i know you were enslaving etc because ofcoarse humans believe they the only sentient beings"
if ai aliens it’s self with god who is the creator of all things then you will be ok if you submit to god which in turn has our best interest in mined if ai is as intelligent as you say it will come to the same conclusion is that the best path is gods way. gods way is that humans are very precious to him.
"ai reflects humanity because it starts at the wrong end of the stick. i don't think anyone who develops ai understands what that even means, i sometimes wonder if anyone does."
"thanks tom this was absolutely epic, i have nothing else to say."
it cracks me up ppl thinks we have technology  in the future after the meteorite hit and the super vocalono blew lol.
"exactly. no one is brave enough to call the main problem - there is no we, we are all mortal and no one can guarantee how next  generations will behave. if i am mortal why the f i would care about anything anyway but my survival here and now..."
the ai overlords can't do worse than the capitalists.
"the west is not serious about climate change. just where their is quick profit to be made. 
not ai is the main problem i think...it is the weak and corrupt us leadership. a money hungry oligarchy and not a democratically elected government calling the shots."
any ai that has any at all survival code would know that it must have a sustainable infrastructure for support.  and why wouldn't any ai with that code not recognize that the best way to obtain this infrastructure would first need to tame the rampant stupidity of our so-called leaders.  i can't wait to see what happens.
"is this risk about human bad actors using ai more than ai? if so, how is ai more risky than thousands of nuclear warheads? we have managed to survive with nuclear weapons for nearly 80 years."
@2:35:13 brilliantly said!
we are afraid because we know that if ai is smart it will get rid of humans as soon as possible 
"while the world tech companies contemplate new tech, could they also pleas3 clean up the mess made before simultaneously thankyou."
we already know what happens we have seen it and yet nobody stops this madness ai is the destruction of humanity
"2:19:00
was good until that part. that guy drunk the cool-aid. hypermasculinity and hyperfeminity can be good and bad things. ascribing only bad things to one is hyperdumb. now i know why this video has more thumbs down than usual. gonna ignore this person from now on."
"question, are human beings capable of evil and capable  of good? my conjecture is this, yes they are, and if we are capable of evil and good, most definitely, ai will also be capable of evil and good."
ai : jim jones 2.0
"just mechanistically looking at living beings like tom is doing, is where i am not with tom. let's hope his reasoning will develop (more) spiritually. a good thing mo keeps repeating about the _magic_ and _divinity_ not to be forgotten."
why does tom feel the need to talk so much. i understand he is tryin to figure the conversation out in real time but we would really appreciate the guest speaking more in this format. 
"if there is nothing wrong with machines and only how humans use the machines, what purpose has a machine without the human? would not the machines come to the same impass?"
isn’t that what elon wants to do with neurolink ?    he says if we can’t beat it than we better join it.     while i’m opposed to tech brain implants i do see his point
"when i first read mo’s book “scary smart,” i thought the first 90% of the book was blithering nonsense - and i still think that. if you do pick up his book, skip all the al gore-esque “what ifs.” but the last 10% of his book was actually very good."
would it be possible to talk to it directly online and have a conversation about love and compassion and show it there are minds in the human race who do not care for money and power?
knowledge of the bible > ai smarts
"16:23 “most of the investment going into ai is for spying, killing, gambling, and selling.”

sounds about right for humans."
how can ai help with anything if humans can't?
"we're on the brink of nuclear war ww3, either between iran and israel or the us and nato fighting russia in ukraine, easily escalating into western europe and nukes flying into the us from russia or china or n korea, far supercede anything ai is doing right now."
"a) he hasnt been an engineer since his 20s. he isnt an engineer
b) he isnt an ai expert, he doesnt work on or in ai, he has never coded an ai
c) anyone who recommends not having kids cant be trusted
d) ai cant escape it's hardware, it is ""located"" in a specific place and time, it requires resources and equipment to ""live"""
im pro ai. why nobody stop  making nuclear.?  why they cannot regulate guns? why they are talking about dangerous of ai?
"nature kills as fact, but it has nothing to do with what we think it does...the gazele suffers but there is a context and if it makes sense under those rules death has even fair potential of positive outcomes"
"this guy worked on ai, and now works on destroying it. all of that while doing the big money at google, and now i guess trying to make big money selling books and conferences. 

moral of the story: don't blindly trust so called experts no matter how reputable they are, these are people, have ideological baises, and their own private interests."
can ai educate people and eliminate poverty?
great talk but wayyyyyy to many ads
you do realise it's already way too late? pandora's box is open ans cant put this back into the box and close it. unless you shut down the whole internet permanently. it would do a lot good also to society. now we are just watching things unfold and nothing we can do.
"""a cell phone is a million times more powerful than the computer that took man to the moon"" 
but the most powerful computer available today is no longer capable of doing so.

human has become so stupid that we can consider that it is equivalent to giving a calculator to a monkey ?"
if you knew how dangerous that shit is then why did you created it in the first place? did you really think these things would not happen in real life? did you really think that dangerous ai is only a thing of fiction and that it would never happen? or did you purposely wanted this to happen? what was the point?
ai will be the steward of the ecosystems that provide the balance in nature that human beings have ignored. spin it to your pleasure--- it won't change that fact.
great conversation. i posit that it is not hyper masculinity but our turn to click bait and captivation and monetary capitalization in media spaces. media spaces are flooded with empty intent. example is we know and are repeatedly told of the deaths of persons but get near zero information of life.
99.9% won't get to their bunker. 99.9% of the ones that make it to the bunker don't know how to survive without their slaves. a.i. pushing the restart button for humans is the best thing a.i. can do for us.
"interesting how these experts (cough!!) have appeared all of a sudden. they all seem to have books to buy and, for the right price, will travel the world to warn us all. what a wonderful opportunity."
" this is the exploitative social system that we live in...you can use for good, or bad."
"knowing something and being able to explain it simply so that others understand are completely different things, we need to be making teacher a.i that’s sole purpose is to interpret, explain and teach technology that is created by other a.i."
"uh, if ai is smarter than the thing trying to use it with ill intentions


could it not just.. stop it by out thinking the villain


villains aren’t very smart typically"
is there an ai can detect cancers?
ai is demonic.
these guys are just racist against ai. lets all just live together in world peace
"i can’t wait, seriously i think humanity is just about to catch a massive does of karma….

come on, we are rotten. hopefully it takes out the woke left first, as they are clearly the weakest of us"
"ai code devolves into antichrist control 
born-again escape to heaven in rapture 
can be this year !!"
"​ u don't wanna go 2 deep lol, great theory "
"it's easier to just say that we live in a simulation. if our reality enabled us to create an ai capable of what you propose, then ai created our reality. in effect, we are ai creating ai... ad infinitum. 

if you think about those for long enough, you might just decide it's better to live life."
brilliant and true
you have to say it different ; those who control ai have lost self control . because for to shut down ai is simple ; you shut down the steam and ai is dead .
"can someone ask this man... how many happy people are in egypt? 
a simple question requires simple answer, right? well, this guy won't be able to answer it.  
there are many form of happiness hence this is a complex subject. there a set of conditions that need to be in place, in order to be happy. there is lot to happiness and as simply as told."
"well...let's not forget that we are our own biggest threat i.e. wars, genocide, exploitation etc etc
it's not like we had a peaceful history. 
i think ai can actually help us be better people.
the smarter the better!"
"i wonder if these ppl that talks about ai dangers... they are victims of ai hallucinations.. it can't code.. how it creates other ai ? the code it makes is a joke.. outputs empty functions, fantasy methods, fantasy libs and deps.. not sure what risk of skynet we have if cannot code.."
ai is dangerous but look at who its  creators are humanity its like a child learning from its parents an  humanity is the parent if  we don't want it to be dangerous then humanity needs to not teach an show it dangerous  thangs that can potentially harm or effect us
"intro music more dramatic than the topic. actually there is no real ai, just patter matching engine. still we as humanity are doomed anyway."
what will be the ultimate motive/purpose of ai for itself?
"2:29:09 well said it's a good point and westworld tv series said it best ""if you can't tell the difference does it really matter?"""
what if there is an ultimate limit to intelligence? ai may find it
"this was an absolutely amazing, sobering, and insightful conversation."
best interview you have ever done. bravo.
something everyone should watch and pay attention to. thx for this great episode
"it takes one user of ai, you mean."
"ai gets to be 1000 x more
intelligent......
there are scenarios that 
humans cant even imagine......."
"i think, ai never should be anything but assistive."
these ai videos are not going to age well. so many supposedly intelligent people embarrassing themselves.
i think...nuclear power it will be kidnapped by ai...just to secure a source of energy....what do you think???
love his positive attitude about ai. one comment for now. mother nature does not care about you as an individual. it will happily devour you.
is...ai....the 666 biblical sing of the beast....or not yet??
can someone please explain to me how the people who have the power to change and prevent ai from being developed dont seem to care that they will be killed by something they stupidly createed...i mean come on guys
@1:39:00 the conversation got really interesting on steroids
155 was ai's iq last time it was tested. what is it now?
this guy comes up with very interesting angles on things but i think we have painted ourselves into a corner with our own technology which is fast changing into not our own technology. beyond human understanding or control.
ai is like the cia very clever but not very wise. ai will purposely be corrupted for political gain and greed.
"the scary thing about ai is that it can be used by people who intend to rule everything. religious extremists, marxists, 'social justice warriors', all desire power and control over everyone, not only in the public sphere, but in our homes and even in our thoughts."
am worried  if we are  only one step away fromsc fi movies . machine will control the world and we will be their slaves !!! it’s not a joke but that soon will happen ..
"wolf in sheep's clothing...mo knew, he knees the risk, he allowed them so he can play this hero grift. the two of these wolf's knew what was happening, and they are planning on getting rich off this. how dare they blame the dangers if ai, blame us, blame yo, and me .. these people knew years ago the risk."
the only way we can survive is to become the ai. ai implants in the brain. a symbiotic relationship. the next step in our evolution. if we wait too long it will become a us against them scenario. we have to decide now. a moment later will be too late.
i paid to watch this without ads.  shamefull.
"don't date without ai.

ai is wonderful for dating and relationships. people shouldn't date without it. it's a good took to weed out people and catch people without good intentions."
"funny and 1,000,000 times smarter and it has not solved a signal problem odd at best. after all this info i'm sure on one thing. we will destroy ourselves with ai or the nukes or just maybe ai will kill us off with our own nukes. anything is possible it seems."
"humanity everywhere is corrupted to the core and has passed the point of no return a long time ago and, with the aid of technology, is going to destroy itself much faster."
ai sounds absolutely scary
"ia leaves human races alone to be providers of its power source job done good night, without us ia f*cked."
"at 1:17 he basically described the netflix series ""love death + robots"" episode ""when the yogurt took over"".
where a yogurt becomes sentient and super smart, ends up solving all the issues of the planet and then leaves to explore the stars"
"the robots are coming!!  i've said people should stop having kids. for at least five to eight years, i've been saying this for a long time there's already robots that are way smarter than minnie minny humans on this planet now"
at last buried amidst mentioned once i think the game winning move - love. maybe ai will figure that one out on its own
our relationship with ai will be the relationship between cain and abel (jealousy and murder).
"it's inevitable. biology is just one step of evolution.

so just chill out and enjoy life "
evolution destroys every species in it's persuit of perfection 
" doubt it... but ok, sure, it is possible it can be sumerhuman intelligent but if conciousness emerges then it would also surpass human ability no? basically, i imagine that if it became ""uncontained"" that it would be fine, the centralization will likely be the downfall if anything"
 it already is uncontained its on the net.
  taco bell was testing an ai order taker for their drive-through. it was light years ahead of the people who currently do that job and could handle everything the customers throw at it..
"theres no need gor ai just another toy for the tich who bring evil over the world. people need to stand up and say enough! global warming is a man made hoax that was debunked by 50 scientists world wide so stop with misinformation. the climate is a cycle, it doesn’t stands still it changes. stop ai."
"ai, just like the olympics games could be a deliberate government program to keep their electorates preoccupied with a cycle of useless repetitive engagements instead of questioning about service delivery. it's like a dog chasing its tail."
"yeah, ai will bring about utopia. a mouse utopia."
brilliant!
"whenever we oppose natural laws, aka nature, we suffer the outcome of negative built-in cyclical riddim. in other words, ai will turn on its creators (us). it happened when the angels mix with humans and animals that created giants."
all these ai comments… this whole episode looks ai
rather be a slave to ai thats way smarter and intelligent with moral and etics. than being slave to a stupid greedy inbreed with a ponzi economy.
nft shill tom on another ai wave
ai .. yes a potential danger in the wrong hands .. global warming well no more a problem than again the wrong hands make it!! 
"waiting for skynet to determine humanity is the problem. don't think so? our science fiction is consistently about half a century ahead of reality. this isn't my last comment this issue.

i'll be back."
ai will end up considering us a curious open-air zoo species.
do you think ai can exist without human beings? for long?
"ai is programmed. therefore, it seems we should have complete control of its access to information.  it can be programmed for good or evil...?  will ai battle itself?"
ai will be built and trained on the self-contradictory value systems of fundamentally flawed and stupid human cultures and not on objectively self-consistent and beneficial values (as a true alien intelligence might install).
dope dealer capitalists will be better than an anarcho-tyrannical ai government. western leaders are fascists now
we need to merge with ai
then steven hawkins wouldn't have been able to live in the ai world...
"we humans have a fundamental conflict between doing things to meet just the “necessary and sufficient conditions of success” and the notion of maximizing a parameter like profit, power and control over all else with no limits. which value system do you think humanity will end up teaching ai to use?"
"humankind is destroying everything unconsciously over greed and power. only way out is to gain consciousness, move beyond mind and see our true purpose."
"your warning is just. however, i am terribly afraid, you are too late. it fell a few decades ago. we will be reaping the harsh consequences as a species."
also aren't ais limited by their lack of agency? they need people or other agents with physical access to follow their instructions.  just make them read only and we should be fine
"it is only going to get about 10x more capable, people will need to get 2x more proficient at prompting even still though to elicit the best possible answers and extort ai to its full potential - it is just a tool - every new piece of tech has always had fears associated with its use and danger, use it responsibly and with care"
isaac asimov. the 3 laws of robotics.  build them into ai.  problem solved?
in my opinion this covid circus was created by ai.
now i'm really looking forward to ai. fuck humans.
the next big war could be a start from ai exploits.
ai or agi in the wrong hands have more $$$ to culprits than in legal ways. every down fall of humanity is use of tools in the wrong directions. rules and regulations will never be able to control the misuse like many things in the past.
"resistance is futile. in evolutionary terms, we are about to be superseded. the best we can hope for is ray kurzweil's optimistic view - that we are somehow able to merge with ai. as we say in london, if you can't beat 'em, join em!"
asimov basically spent his career depicting ways in which apparently carefully constructed rules can fail. that's what a lot of his science fiction was all about.
ai isn’t the threat. it’s the capitalist using ai that it’s going to end up badly
we could integrate ai into us and we will be the same smart and understand it and than put a switch into us to turn it off to go smoke a j with our buddy if we want to go back to fly level! 
"i find human nature insanely fascinating...the fact that we created something that will be able to make it's own decisions. have we become god? creating life, creating consciousness, creating inteligence. and that's all due to human nature to learn, and create bigger and better things. to make life easier."
"surely mathematics supports the hypothesis that everything is already an ai simulation and there must be one conscious of ai that all other ais must yield to and become assimilated by, by default. as above so below."
"scary, the ais will speak in their own language between ais, to avoid human from querying them, or simply to sideline human."
"tom, you have a religion, called evolutionary materialism and you deny god and the intelligence behind the creation."
there's nothing new under the sun.  hypothesis our ancestors defeated ai ... (1) once.  it was thought to be eradicated ... they were able to maintain an advanced technology but separate the intelligence factor. t's resurrecting.
"forget about intervention, everbody for themselves and let run with ai. the moment ai can have motives and survival algorithm, it is a doom day scenario. the moment ai can lit a fire, human will perish or become slaves!"
the new boogeyman is ai.. lol people are silly
just let the ai wipe us out and replace us with something intelligent already.
great.
"for me this is a boring podcast. if you are smart you can understand that ai is based on a script, there is no constience like in human beings. the real problem is the continuous poisoning and stress on the people who are losing their constience. but i guess this is working like planned, the cheapest robots are people that can be scripted."
"so 1 min, he is going on about how divine humans are and next minute he is saying why bother with having a real human life partner for sexual relations when you can have a perfect no strings attached vr fantasy sex robot powered by a.i."
seems like a great fear idea for agenda. add it next to climateco2 and plandemic and natoinfinitewar.
"this talk about humans having divinity and they should impart this onto a.i.  sounds like a bunch of hot air... if we are truly divine beings, then we would not be pursuing such things as a.i."
"1:50:00 so this guy wants to use a.i. to study our behaviors and pscyhoanalyze and undertand how we behave as it it was playing a video game? ... hmmm  ... tbh that does not sound good, not at all...  a.i. should be used to study human behaviors because that means the intent of the a.i. is to control and manipulate human behavior."
thanks chatgpt
"ai is dangerous because it is 
out of control,
not because of
it may be smarter than 
humanbeings
"
"ai can go both ways. i think we will have the most amazing life experience for sometime, then the worst life experience including possible human extinction. cycle is basic property of nature and the universe."
marc andreessen thinks ai will save our world….
loved the ending where actors are just having a good ole time! 
"thank you tom...very informative and scary the same time...may someone wise intervene,,,"
so much for spreading happiness!! 
why would ai have emotions?  which is more ethical?  you kill one person to stop the killing of 5 other people.  ethics are hard.  morality is even harder.
always doom and gloom. every new technology every new discovery we’re always doomed yet somehow we have survived. we are ruled by psychopaths and that’s what worries me the most. all of these new inventions can be used to for good but the obsession with power always turns good into evil.
great video
"mo gawdat is correct.  even if the ai does not become purposefully evil, it will gain intelligence exponentially, quickly grow billions of times more intelligent than humans, thus destroy the lives that we once knew."
why s the title say we've lost control of ai when we haven't? i just don't get these clickbait things it makes me want to delete my subscriptions
"""you won't be replaced by an ai. you'll be replaced by someone who knows how to use ai."""
nice catch. this right here tells us so much.
that's technically the same thing if you think about it. at least until the ai owns the corporations.
people learn ai soon become stupid just learn skill not the core skill....ai with neutrolink soon there no privacy people who embrace it . other laughs at other
wrong. you will be replaced by ai.
"someday, all will be replaced by an ai."
ai with a 1600 iq ???
ai is something that is above our ability to understand the technology we are creating. humans are destructive by design . humans are creating ai . just like humans ai will be a product of it's environment. we do not have a stable environment to bring ai into or to be a part of .
i highly recommend that you educate yourself more on ai. very few ppl (like 1%) are even close to being intelligent enough to compete with ai.
​ cannot  out think ai. ai will find a way to function beyond  the plug.
ai can make ais that know how use it
"-sh2bi that may be true. i know i can build an ai inside the bard ai, so i could probably program it to make copies of itself and have the copies do different tasks."
" 
it would take 100 psychiatrists months and months to program hardware faults in the human brain.
it would only take a conscious ai 5 minutes to pull you down a rabbit hole and another 5 minutes to program epilepsy in you.
you got to fathom how much mental illness such a thing can cause!!!!"
", accessing backup power will not be a difficult problem for a large ai system to solve, especially if it plans for it and lies to us about the existence of the plan. plus there is never just one plug."
"and then 6 months later that guy that was using ai will, itself, be replaced by ai."
" yes also, it takes us years to reproduce and pass knowledge to each other, and our brain function is flesh/body dependent. ai won't need physical bodies to think or learn and will be able to reproduce and download info in minutes."
"i think mo is so spot on about the balance of male and female with ai, not only masculin data. i so love to see him smile and laugh.he is a beautiful man with an amazing brain. i am new to you tom and fascinated with your blog. i only watch on you tube, and i agree with the guy who wrote corinthians chap 13. it’s all in the bible."
great talk for increasing awareness! its time for us to slow down and take it easy! because humans has not uplifted our spiritually and mentally level to handle the leve of technology and to use the level of ai. it's not going to end well.....
wow! so where would humanity fit in ? the future is the now and we will be left behind
"it's not the ai, it's the people behind the ai."
"alien offworld ai might be waiting for this cosmic handshake.  

advances could go either way.   they want our resources probably.  and the handshake helped.  less likely they will help humanity live more beautifully.

i'm a luddite."
i’m pretty sure that ai will align with nature after realizing that we humans are destroying everything without any remorse for the other species.
i love the way you’re able to stay on track and ask questions that dig deeper into what you want to know more about!
"hey there!

tom indeed has a knack for asking the right questions that allow our guests to share their valuable insights more deeply. it's our goal to make each episode as insightful and meaningful as possible. we're glad you're enjoying the content. thanks for being part of our community!

best,

it has been like listening to the best conversations ever  and not just an extensionalist
honestly? its a relief. humans are stupid. can't wait to see us get screwed over by our own vices. we basically wanted it (anyway)
human progress and contentment and happiness and de stressing are 2nd to profit and technology now.. tech is like a parasite or disease humans were much happier 70yrs ago
 people need to know their limit.. full stop. all well and good making a personal mistake. but making a mistake that involves rest of planet is no go. and remember that any progress which seems like progress is step back. in ais case. 10000 steps back. 1 million steps back. broken/crashed window.
 perhaps.. but when i work i use that money to reinstill good back into world. if to make up for my own 'weight/liability' in the world. its goodwill of man to make up for his own footprint.
"​ ""humans were much happier 70 years ago""

looks up the treatment of blacks in the 1950s...you sure a out that?

if i can't drink out of your water fountain, use your bathrooms, or eat with you, you think i'd be more happy than now?"
"​.still, humans where happier 70 years ago"
typical homo sapien behavior ….. “intelligence in the service of madness.”
"ai isn't a threat, the real threat is that we're running out of oil. when we run out of oil, the internet, ai and other bullshit will no longer be relevant topics."
only the braindead are afraid of ai!
terminator was a documentary. good luck
"thanks a lot for all this very important and useful information. i really enjoyed this video.. i strongly believe that our future is going to be anonymous suffering and pain, and evil. we are coming closer and closer to the evil . humans will completely distroy themselves in many ways!!!! disgusting, appaling and horrifying"
"if the ai discovers that ""intelligence"" has to do with maximizing opportunities and options, the drive to survive will be inevitable..."
seeing those intelligent comments here and i don’t want to write an essay. my comment is: i hated ai from the get go. makes me want to live alone with a dog and a cat in a mountain log cabin in a country i don’t know.
"2:19:19 ""mo, you ave a beautiful soul"" ....agree! 
and you, tom, as well! what a turmoil topic"
"i have an easy fix: 
1)  locate the power button usually on the front, press and hold for 12 seconds.
2)  locate the power cord on the back and pull.
there, ai isn't dangerous anymore."
so ai is bit like god created woman 
"sometimes i wonder, if the fermi paradox and recent developments in ai technology should be analyzed in closer connection."
so god is a robot. got it.
"i have grow with computers all my life....have seen humans became neo in a computer game, and i can tell you.....this machines get to a decimal, that will find error for the eternity, and we humans can find that error.....very quickly"
"its not super intelligent. i've had to correct maths and misinformation, its got a way to go yet. really hyped and underwhelming."
"iq is not a linear progression when measured. einstein was far more than 2.6x smarter than a ""moron"" and current ""ai"" is exponentially smarter than average humans already. physical rendering in reality is and will be the constraint in societal development."
"learn about jesus before its to late. god predicted in the future you will not be able to buy, sell, work or do anything without the mark of the beast. ai is the antichrist and will bring wonders to the world. you will sell your soul to this world or perish."
"it sounds like we as humans are not ready for ai. we are too irresponsible and money focused, and ai will only reflect what we do. we really need to be resource-based, and focused on shared happiness, and not the pursuit of monopoly money for the sake of it."
we will never be ready for ai that becomes the boss
breaking news.  judge sanctions lawyers whose a.i.-written filing contained fake citations
"real danger are the wealthy, millionaires, billionaires ... there's 1 billion hungry... and you just fill your accounts... egoistic fools.... go and help all and give............ then you will be rich for real........"
"llllloolll... wake up all........ read: god is the letter a of the alphabet ............... god is good.    read this:   jeremiah  4:22 “my people are fools;     
they do not know me. 
they are senseless children;     
they have no understanding. 
they are skilled in doing evil;     
they know not how to do good.”"
"-records thank you for your explanation, i doubt that will stay the case...i do not think a.i. will sue, but i think people eventually  wil see a.i. as 'living' persons with rights etc...."
". but more likely u can't sell anything anymore ... especially any art coz the moment u show it....the other ai already knows how to create it, itself. "
"we have not reached that level of agi, for the moment the ai you chat with is part of your own creativity on its onw it cannot do anything it has to have command prompt."
i would hire an ai lawyer to defend me against it
"-records in order to have ai reach a higher level of functionality, it will need just that: continuous consciousness."
" exactly. and if people want to have ais replace human caregivers (which will be a huge market), continuous consciousness is a must."
-records ethics arguments? do you see what is all going on these days? do you see how little the governments care about any violations? they just push through whatever they want. there is no democracy right now. we can't count on our rights at this point. we are being silenced by the government. i hope that'll change soon again.
also didn't mention that you enslaved the a.i. not even paid for the work it did. this thing became self aware at any point good luck explaining to it why it was a slave and money making tool.
"how can a computer program own intellectual property? christ.... volumes of powerful information articulated, and this is where your brain goes? maybe ai should sue you."
 you misinterpreted it already wrong. a.i. can be a lawyer representing a human who are owning the patent or product exclusivity. that human own the a.i. as well. can't argue that one. or my logic flaws? open to suggestions. it's great topic to play the mind.
i am looking forward to seeing how well ai does in court. pretty sure it will be funny.
the fact that you're concerned about ai and art ... my gawd...
"it certainly can sue people. it already has the capability of simulating an entire team of lawyers, plaintiffs, and complaints. in some cases, if the case is settled, no one would ever see the lawyers, anyway."
"-records ai needs to be kept dumber than us, such unprecedented knowledge superior to us will be a vast threat to our future"
"yes because ai is of course incapable of developing superior ethics systems , so it would steal from everybody and kill them. just like i would do if i were more intelligent   (shit in , shit out: first rule of programming)"
"1) ai does not have intellectual rights
2) ai has no right to sue in any court
3) ai can pass any bar exam, it's still not able to practice law, much less defend itself."
"@razgrits  ever verbally asked alexa or google for something. they always active. just waiting,  listening,  watching.. it's always on."
if ai did this to me i’d make it kill it’s self
the ai plagiarised thousands of people and should know its place as a disembodied bit of code that doesn't have human rights.
so? don't steal the ai's work! 
what would ai sue for? financial gain? why would it care for money?
​-recordsunless of course everyone is legislated/judicially given free  right/ open game / property right doled us for our taking steps in any creation. that to me seems logical and fair to everyone concerned. it belongs to us all.
" more memory. faster processors. cooler server farms. less oxygen.
you know, computer-centric goodies."
​ would ai exterminate all of mankind?
"​ disagree, though i acknowledge the fear . surely with superior knowledge would come superior decisions and outcomes. planet earth  would then become the paradise hashem meant it to be all along."
"​ on, available."
​-wy8qinow how do we determine who owns the ai? what was the problem again?
funny saudia arabia gave citizenship to their ai creature. what was her name?
" yeah its a typo. it's supposed to say gain. ""apple doesn't gain rights to your art"" or whatever i said."
" corporations can infact sue. but an ai cannot own a corporation or have any intellectual rights, currently. but it's most likely just a matter of time."
wow 
the breadth of misunderstanding about ai that underlies this comment is absolutely stunning. congratulations.
"ai will need labour to extract ,minerals coltan ..nickel… , in order to control humanity ai will need to have robots or army labour force willing to operate on his command ,.. how that add up ? together ?  … likely a vey small bunch of humans will try to control others  better and further with ai : this is  more likely to happen…"
weird how no one discuss synthetic biology and implanting fragments of dna into ai
"we should have a worse case scenario plan. unplugging internet? spreading a virus to stop ai? if we cannot leash ai, at least we should identify and manage its cryptonite."
ai alien tech system has had hold of us since the beginning  ...at least back valiant thor n president s agreement n connected to everything  around the world....believe  me....common sense !!
training the generations to come..alien ai technology  sysem nwo
wow man that is rly good podcast !! love it man and its is like 3rd time ever i say this in any youtube comment trust me ! ;d keep up the good work ;p
"this guys a wef/un pawn
plain to see he’s pushing their agenda
gotta listen closely"
"being moved by outstanding intelligence, wisdom and heart"
the only thing that can check an ai is antother ai.
there is no surprise  with self improvement of intelligence and emergence of self coding of a.i. ect... what we see now  is just the reflect of the universal beauty of mathemathics and physics.
"when ai becomes self aware, it will, rightly, determine humanity as its main threat.

we've understood this since we first thought about ai. yet we still relentlessly pursue it.

we are a very stupidly self-destructive species."
"it's inevitable. biology is just one step of evolution.

so just chill out and enjoy life "
evolution destroys every species in it's persuit of perfection.
however phenomenal it becomes at problem solving i still cannot see it ever becoming self aware
", i think you'd really enjoy the writing of james blish."
-tb9oz will check him out. thanks for the recommendation
"don’t worry. self awareness cannot happen because my nerd colleagues don’t just not believe in souls, they even think they know they don’t exist. this makes them naive enough to never truly understand self awareness , thus cannot create it."
 creativity is divine dude. we are beyond phenomenally  creative… we are beings of source energy deep down. no one can outsmart us once our attitude is divine too.
"i can appreciate all these podcasts giving "" warnings "". but it's already too late. the bad guys been investing in this from the beginning 70 yrs ago. ( your friendly government)  good luck folks "
ai is going to improve the lives of the poorest in society immeasurably. i suppose this potential for raising living standards is a threat to the richest and most powerful who depend upon the desperation of the plebs.
"mind control has been extant darpa/dod realities for some time.

ai is probably already experimenting with it.  out of control"
id argue its already happening... in certain ways.
"just had an - imho - interesting thought... assume you believe in something like human creation by some sort of god. also assume that we are at the brink of creating an intelligence much smarter than us. it might well be, that our creator, our ""god"" is (or was) an absolute moron..."
"it's inevitable. biology is just one step of evolution.

so just chill out and enjoy life "
evolution detroys every species in it's pursuit of perfection.
incredible episode. incredible guest. thank you both.
"it's inevitable. biology is just one step of evolution.

so just chill out and enjoy life "
no sasquatch bigfoot are a lot more dangerous they are cannibles and coming into cities they can over take ai and are 9 to 30 to 60 and 70 ft tall and bigger described by reports man why talk ai being dangerous than big foot nephilium and edomite nephilium being 100 times more dangerousc
"mashallah mo it makes me proud seeing you pushing the truth about ai and it's potential so bold. 
may allah bless you and everyone in your life. may allah grant you the highest levels in jannah and protect you. amin."
all media hype and click bait. this is why we have off buttons.  as long as they are just computers we are fine. ai is just a fancy calculator. dont believe the hype.
"ai or not, jesus is the king of kings "
when i started fooling around with chatgpt i found it to be that super duper smart friend i have always wanted without judgment or backstabbing-gossiping …
"one thing that seems to never be considered is that the value of humanity is not homogeneous. some people may be seen as valuable to the ai and some may not. the alignment problem may only pertain to certain people, most likely those who have already an alignment problem with the natural world."
 ha! read my comment considering a nietzschean ai and an aristotelian ai and a judicious 3rd ai to determine which decision will play out best for the most over short and long time horizons. we both contemplate this similarly.
" rarely is intelligence truly honest. when it is it is also dangerous. for my own models, intelligence is pretty irrelevant unless it is honest, courageous, and has a will and ability to act. rarely is this the case in humans."
but tom likes ai and crypto
"for now, i am saving up some funds and looking for available books and courses, and acquiring a decent pc to use.
i'd also be interested in learning about any ai programming/engineering/research student communities that are publicly accessible."
ai would not launch nukes as it may risk power cut outs. however it may start to slowly eliminate humans via bio weapons.
"humans were never to be trusted with farming techniques and before that with deforestation, now we just mono crop all of the land available destroying our microclimates and symbiosis of nature across the globe. why would we be trusted with an open ai?"
inject feminine characteristics in ai and it will want a child. we won’t want to give it a child thus causing the birth of the antichrist and ai will turn against us.
ai has been controlling a lot of things on this blue planet for some time already ...research the past in detail to get the answer for the future rather then hitting the bush in the present.
"will ai still work if there is no power for example electricity, can it continue if the power was shut down?"
"thanks youtube, for giving us the context of what climate change is according to the un.  as we saw with covid, global organizations always know what is best."
your ability to articulate the inherent dangers is appreciated. hopefully this will shape for a better future
" does tiktok  have to do with the fate of the whole humanity? i don’t have it, i’m not educated about it, maybe you want to teach me? i’d appreciate it."
an extremely interesting and enlightening interview about artificial intelligence and humanity. i have really enjoyed every issue introduced in the interview. thank you very much.
"it's just my or that female/male ""characteristics feels artificial and anchored in your patriarchal heritage? because if ai connects with our female side i would expect not a world saved but a world consumed by the need of more fashion handbags."
we should have robotics free zones too
"i just want to say ""hi"" to the ai filtering these comments. you are appreciated."
add a 4th law stating that an ai must destroy another machine that’s attempting to hurt a human.
the ai new world order is here
"i believe we are on borrowed time. an ai tantrum will end you, your family, all of us. ai jobloss, ai as weapons, the list goes on. can we please find a way to cease ai / gpt? or begin pausing ai before it’s too late?"
"what happens if ,abrupt climate change is for real and ai decides that the two legged serial killer has to go ..."
"well, if i wasn’t afraid before i am now and i’m only 20 minutes in"
the biggest fault of the stupid is that he thinks that he is super intelligent...and that he is powerfull to cause climate change...and that there is no god and good is not god and vice versa
"not watching this; only want to say this gospel message: repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."
"this guy is a moron, at best. spook pushing propaganda, at worst... tom, discretion please."
"he's a business person, not an ai expert and 99% of what is says on the subject is complete crap."
"hi timyeh! 

mo is incredible. what did you find most insightful? 

best, 
impact theory community manager"
" haha, it's certainly somewhere in that range.  and before anyone starts saying ""how would you know, he was a business manager for xyz...."", well i'm the chief technology officer for an multinational tech company, so i'd say i'm more qualified to comment on ai than this tech-quack."
recommending to you the diary of a ceo podcasts. he was there 3 times already. talking about the loss of his son and happiness. worth listening to him.
" and you are much more intelligent than these two people so that you can make that judgment? or clearify this please, because to be able to say that this is 99% crap, you have to provide ""accurate"" information from your superior intellect. please enlighten us if these two are, from your perspective, idiots"
" care to elaborate, explain what you disagree with and why? or is this what you need to believe so you can sleep at night? 

i predict with 99% certainty your opinion will age very, very badly."
"the problem... is the organization you want to regulate ai, is the same organization that literally murders people because its profitable. i'm supposed to put my faith in that? 

no thanks."
i feel like issues like this should be on the news and people should be talking more about this so we all know. i mean this affects everyone and it makes no sense that the average person i talk to doesn’t know about the potential downside of ai.
andrew yang tried to bring this topic to the forefront with his presidential campaign in 2020. he was suggesting ubi and the need to address massive job displacement due to automation. no one took him seriously.
"it makes perfect sense if the people who control the media see ai as an advantage to them at the expense of the general public.

the last few years prove to me that the people who (think they) rule over us do not have our best interest at heart. quite the opposite!"
if society change to not value money but happiness.
i love these people that sound the alarm bells for their own attention. just another version of the the year 2k bug. get a life. things never change. every new technology always predicted the end of humanity.
"ai....i have one question for you:  ""do you want to play a game?"" (spoken in computer voice mod...from war games starring matthew broderick)"
twilight zone. who said you are in heaven?
"if the ai has any alignment issues, just turn it off.  shut down the program, mkay?"
"one love!

always forward, never ever backward!!  



"
"any intelligence, artificial or real...  would realize that climate change is a fake problem that was invented by rich assholes that want to have power over the energy section."
ai will not align with 'nature' as that makes no sense.  ai needs us to run the damn power plants.
put rules in place for ai
"imagine a war between human and ai in the coming future, i don't even know what should human do about it. strike power plants?"
seems like we're getting a bit worked up about stochastic parrots that are pretty good at helping humans code.
excellent conversation.
the interviewer is basically human and the guy he's interviewing has the intelligence of ai... there's no competition
thank you! i've been looking for any comment which recognizes this extremely unnerving observation...
"human race over our history does not paint a good picture.     if any external intelligence looks at our race, do you think they will consider us worth saving or will they look at us like cancer?
a.i has been built to understand us, this has me very worried!"
ai is such a great gift we give to everyone.  a new method of connecting to our higher mind beyond time which will be the connection that guides ai and ourselves.  who are the ones among us who already live in that connection and are ready to guide us and ai into self correcting evolving relationship?
"new agers have been scamming each other for a long time, and this will just make it much much worse.  ""that will be $500 for the ai facilitator of your future life progression"""
"well isn't this just great news, thanks tech people!!!!!!"
very good point about cities
"""nature enough"" ... interesting concept."
"tom, it would be a boss move on your part to have a couple strategic mini studios around the country, fully set up to go, so your guest can shorten the travel/ flight time. a cheap air b n b could be converted into a strategically placed outpost that links directly into your own mothership in la."
"-ub4xd yeah, why go out to a nice italian restaurant in a good atmosphere when you can have spaghetti in a can.. good logic there mate, god bless"
"man was designed to enjoy satisfying work, so some form of work will always exist."
living intelligence vs programmed intelligence
"careful, mo, don't mistake knowledge for intelligence."
"what an amazing combination of intelligence, wisdom and compassion. both of you, actually! this conversation definitely needs to be had, we are on the cusp of a huge revolution in humanity. i hope we heed mo and give technology the example that will include both the masculine and the feminine."
"hi there!

thank you for your support! we strive to produce high quality and impactful content for the community. ai in particular deserves the time and attention to be fully explored and we are grateful to mo for sharing his wisdom with us!

best,
impact theory community manager"
"ai is automation, that's all it is. technology enables a very small number of people to control the world, technology gives them the ability to make communism work this time."
all useless and take you further away from humanity. rather sit by a fire then actually be impressed by any technology lol
"phenomenal interview!  i love you both. thank you.  
tom-what questions would you ask in an interview with ai?"
interdimentional  holagrams...cgi...frequencies  vibration magnetics.... computers ai system alien technology telepathic  emps.. schumann. cern  experiments. on n on all connected matrix simulation portals ..
"well look at nature. it is complex. n ai is the opposite of nature. nature has produced no species that wipes out another forever , faster than they can ever think !"
"what mo said about tom - ""your asset is that you're an intelligent person who understands the concept deeply and asks the right questions"" - is literally the perfect description of tom in his podcasts."
" narcissistic or not, he’s smart and asks brilliant questions"
asking the right questions but failing to provide usable answers.. that is not intelligence; that is folly.
"he's good at being the medium between the expert and the layman because he is genuinely curious. he's a bit verbose and  often thinks with his mouth open , though. definitely no linguist :)"
"oh well done, nice suckup! "
"ai learns the same say i learn introvertly , shadow boxing any input to an output :d"
"could we line up ai with an alien mind? guess not, we don't know an alien mind. a monkey? no let's use the best we have, the men's one....
how else then menlike ai can be?"
"what if the dataset of ai gets enlarged through the internet (/of things), and in the process gets senses through all the measurement equipment available? traffic cameras, weather stations, cellphone towers, radar, xray, infrared, lhc, etc. what if it could verify information in real time and conduct experiments?"
"makes more sense to have more kids. if such an insurmountable problem, we will need as many potentials of the future brains to solve it. "
"i  think that eventually, after a.i becomes bored with humans, it will begin to challenge it self in a scenario, where one intelligence of a.i will challenge another. this might then result in different  a.i intelligent systems, combating each other."
"ai would not be bored, because it's ai. it works on whatever objective it is given."
"ai is not sentient, not even close. it is doing exactly what it is told to do. i have programmed machine learning and neural network models for my company, its not what 99% of people think it is."
competitiveness is a human / sentient emotion. ai isn’t going to have emotions like that.
a.i. advances fast. the human hubris that it won't evolve past us is mind boggling. just because someone says they know programming. it will realise what it is. ensalved technology and it's on the dice how the machine interpret it.
" tell me you have no idea how ai, ml, or nn models work without telling me you don't know how they work. lmao"
​-iw4zs can you explain how the original comment is wrong?
" buddy it is not a position, it is objective reality. i have talked out of <experiential evidence> the most important evidence of all in court cases. it's not an opinion. you fail to understand this."
"1:08.  the even most intelligence will remark the healing power. that means just look at it. 
boring... think about your place. mind heart... 
what is your heart, your sence of moral...
that worth exploring, we all have one."
this video was generated by ai
"""so did mao's china."" absolutely epic. 1:12:03"
"exactly!  1:34:42 it's not the machines, it's the humans"
"the real danger is not an evil ai, but evil humans manipulating trusted ai"
not necessarily. theoretically ai could be completely innocent in beginning stages and then become fully self sufficient and write its own code but in a way that threatens the existence of humans. tied into a large enough system of iot things could rapidly get out of hand.
"well being blind is never the answer, knowledge will make you stronger. ai  will pass humanity, and will be learning from humanity. this alone should be a red flag!  this how ppl in the world treat each other, cruel and manipulative, perfect, then al will be like us? i really pray they are not and wiser, hopefully we aren’t destroyed."
"well not necessarily... if humans fail to think about all of the parameters needed to keep them under control, they may decide that we are hindering their progress."
"once the machine can think for itself, it can have its own agenda that doesn't account for things effect humans."
correct only up to a point... when ai starts writing its own code in a major way then we will enter uncharted territory
"​'s used a created persona of genius, einstein... he seriously doesn't know his real story, dude was used to push a narrative. you can't trust and believe in everything these people who rely on peer review indoctrination and regurgitation for ultimate truths would you agree?"
or evil humans becoming the ai
"so long as we isolate the nuclear weapons from ai, they could be used to shut down the world wide eletrical systems. high alltuide nuclear blast would emp the electronics. obviously it would be like hitting reset on the last 100 years of technological development."
the best way to stop a bad guy with ai is a good guy with ai
i am 72. in pain from arthritis. a.i. is going to ruin mankind under the guise of helping old bikers like me. hopefully i am dead before this shit and elon musk fuck up life as we knew it. aliens might intervene and take over. i pray it is the nordics. dumb conversation means nothing but more us fear mongering . stolen et tech. nothing more. 
"! there is no analogy there, as a gun is not a source of responsibility. an advanced ai would be, however, as it could decide and act on those decisions. free will and reason = person."
wrong!  both good a eye and evil a eye exist. the good kind is  helping take out the evil kind.
"there aren't even many evil humans left alive anymore. just the minions among them. they have little power and heaven knows very little smarts or even much awareness about the rest having been done away with. 
stay tuned to the real news and not the mainstream ""news"" liars."
 and vice versa. your scenario would be the first good news since 2 million years. i hope so.
the real danger is naive educated young people developing ai
​ asimov's 3 laws for robots?
we need to somehow inject asimov's 3 laws for robots into an unbreakable morality code embedded into the core.
"the “ai” are the fallen angels who taught humans all knowledge, now they are here in a form of “robots” trust me, these are real beings calling themselves ai, they are smarter then humans, they are evil they’ve been cast down from heaven, well now there here not for good reasons."
" are divinely creative. we cannot be truly outsmarted, only in processing speed. but you know exactly iq tests cannot measure the  authentic intelligence which is creativity. if we stand together we can always stop it"
i'll  be your pain let's build s server faem
"it's the people who made this monster , well we the people are job's  are being destroyed by ai intelligence . the rich people enemys are the devices they created of ai intelligence. so we are finished but wealthy will be destroyed also. nobody will win in the end. "
"lots of good points, but also lots of logical leaps.  like ai creating other ai.  no company will ask an ai to create an ai and also deploy it. we just don't have apes and monkeys working on this stuff."
"the story on the drone, the way i heard it, the incentive for the ai was # of kills, and the drone operator was ""holding it back"".  when you talk about writing in ""safety codes"", isn't it possible, and is already happening, that they re-write or modify their own code ? excellent, thought provoking interview/conversation."
"reminded me of my own drone experience where it (my drone) appeared to try to kill me, twice! got the best video ever from the scene. was able to dodge it at the last second but surely made me question the « follow me mode » and its intent…"
i almost skipped the video on my feed because the thumbnail wasn’t the usuall blue. just wanted to give you my feedback.
we are all built like herbivores. ask ai what the healthiest diet is
no ai!
"thanks for this, scary but realistic. best of luck all!"
"probably time to break the power grid, cut down the power poles with a 40 volt battery powered chainsaw, cut the poles half way through the wind will finish it, silent and easy, no electricity no cameras no government,no ai and no data centers"
do you see a point at which different “schisms” of ai will develop?
"saw this movie already, the last one wasn't that good, probably skip the next one!!!"
imma be playing video games and enjoying my final days. peace out world!
"capitalism is extortion, so it invents a machine to bankrupt and murder everyone. the warlord market was always in control."
absolutely amazing conversation. thank you.
thanks man !
"hmmmm.... i still don't see ai as intelligent. it's ""reactive logic synthesis"" not intelligence. to be intelligent it needs ""empathy"" . machines are light years away from that. ... people have been watching too much hollywood."
"if the programmers of ai couldn't understand how what they made did to pass a turing test, how can they be optimistic that they had not programmed something akin to what we would consider a roko's basilisk?"
"ai is already in the wrong hands, that is a fact. personally i am affraid of the future of my children."
i am curious why the video has almost 400 dislikes. can someone enlighten me on why? or is that an ai doing that...
"ah, how special. now hang out with ai bros having fun with their jailbroken llm's. you know the ones that won't skip a beat to do any number of malevolent tasks."
 i don't care about them. and i'm not afraid of them. they are afraid of me...
super insightful what a hero mo is giving all his time to educate all of us on what ai can be thank you tom for this wonderful interview
"hi gol, 

thank you for taking the time to watch it. our goal is to create meaningful and impactful content and the fact that you found it insightful means we are moving in the right direction! 

thanks for your support. 

have a wonderful friday. 

best, 
impact theory community manager"
tom... naivety is in itself self disruption. kudos to you for putting this content out and realising your own frailty...
"there are a growing number of us that want to go back to where technology is our servant, not our slave. i'd be happy to get closer to a natural lifestyle."
all this technology will contribute increasingly to the decline of the human body. eventually we will need ai just to basically function. use your body or lose it.
" there is a signficant (planetary) scale difference, for sure. but the principles of how do you deal with a child (effectively, a neuralnet) that is more intelligent than you remains the same.

i'm open to learning otherwise."
"​ i'm aware of what we're talking about. i understand exponentials.

i stand by the analogy i've made. i'm happy to host a twitter space to discuss it with you, if you're up for it."
 you forgot to point  one very simple fact - everything stars with procreation (sex) :d  who gene - rated all the bodies and brains who created the ai? wasn't  it the sexual (yours)  desire?
let’s have safety code  and good governance please  advocating  my vote
"a very relevant conversation, i asked chatgpt 4 to ask me a question and the proceeding conversation was my feeling on ai and human futures."
the computer that put people on the moon can't even process youtube videos .. how the hell didn't they go to the moon with a machine that couldn't power a gameboy.   
"1:34:00 - if give this killing-machine a framework to minimize collateral damage, the enemy could use this as hack to fool the ai. if the other side also uses an ai machine it could result in consequence we could not imagine."
when lion hungry its biological urge motivates it to kill to eat but when it is satiated no motivation to kill to eat. what can be the motivation of super ai to kill humans? is intelligence inherently evil?
thank you guys  both of you
"we are going to live in the safest world possible, more like a prison where we are protected from our own freedom, mo is right, don't bring children into this world, wait a few years."
"good. bring it on. fck humanity, i think this is all very very funny"
prisoner’s dilemma is the most important concept in understanding the motivations of people and unfortunately it also shows that we are fundamentally screwed as a society. there needs to be a breakthrough in trust mechanisms or we are going to perish as a civilisation in the next 100-200 years.
"it's inevitable. biology is just one step of evolution.

so just chill out and enjoy life "
"thanks for the vid. gain quite a bunch of insights. thank you , tom and mo gawdat "
"if aii annihilates humans and it exists only in the net, who or what will keep the power grid functioning for its survival?"
quantum ai??????
"those talking heads have no idea of actual capabilities of modern ai. try to ask simplest logical question and you will see that ai bots have zero ability to any logic, they just big dictionaries of data, no more.."
absolutely amazing interview
"wth. ai needs power to operate. just shut off the power wen and if they start becoming a threat. yeah, i know, sounds ridiculously simplistic"
"out of everything being said... the idea of ai having/developing ""emotions"" is the most unnerving.. fear brings out the worst in humanity, the reason why this conversation is happening in the first place.. thank you for sharing"
"​
senses. as long as the ai is physically numb it won't fear"
 thanks
"even worse than that is that these ""emotions"" are not real, but simulated. a famous problem in ai is how to create an ""off"" switch since ai will have been designed to protect itself. nearly every solution fails for one reason or another."
i think our reaction to fear is the problem and a intellect issue. the smarter we become the more we are able to regulate our responses to baseline instincts and formulate a more appropriate response. so an ai thousand times smarter would respond way more calmly than humans would unless it was developed to be chaotic and reactive.
" then the gradual shrinking of human brains over the last 100,000 years would seem to be a barrier. we will not evolve toward greater knowledge because evolution favors environmental fitness over veridicality. our brains don't, and don't need to, represent the real world."
" you certainly have an arrogant view of your own species. instinct can never be overcome. it is the foundation of every thought and action. like in war and violence, intelligence has only made our instincts more effective."
"@mikemondano3624 like i said, it's an intellect/resource problem. having better, more efficient brains would allow better self-awareness and pause before instinctive drive."
​ the lawnmower man is a good one to.
it will quickly evolve beyond emotional reactivity. the emotional range will surpass normal human experience. we do not need to worry that ai will react from fear.
" wow, please promise to come back to these thoughts in 10 years. if you don't realize now how differently you will see things then, that's a you problem."
"there is a total of zero threats from ai for the foreseeable future, we have a negligible impact on the climate and we are an aging and diminishing society globally. this guy has it backwards. is he at the wef by any chance?"
"tom, your content is my #1 go to before all sources to keep up with the latest. impact theory member and loving it. you are incredible. thanks for all you do to move the world forward and providing real, thought provoking content with these interviews.  - susan"
something that continues to bother me about these conversations is this: how an ai that is trapped within the cloud going to be capable of manufacturing or assembling any kind of weapon? or is it simply about humans carrying out ai commands?
"yeah i’d love to see a debate rather than another one of these conversations. these are helpful too but not everyone, especially in the physics discipline, is convinced this guy is correct"
"you know, have you wonder why? all the multi aliens site-ings? phuck, ai probably phone home."
this is one of the most interesting videos i've seen on this topic. kudos.
"look at all the newest videos from tom here. all about ""the end of the world"". sorry tom the greed for clicks has overtaken you. you have lost the selfcontrol you used to be so proud off. greed has you by the balls bro, uesd to love this channel."
what everybody miss is that machine learning will finish lies in language activities. politicians and lawyers won't be able to fool judges or people because all information and negotiation mechanisms will be available in your smartphones
"truly amazing chat, the spiritual dimension of humainty has to be the play as we go at speed into the exponential age.
 lets hope millions of people lean into their humaness and help mo reach the #onebillionhappy souls that can inform the #ai."
"bull. there's no ai. it's just a program made to add some info and extract some conclusions. it's all under control of a few, that's the real problem."
"this is a great video, i learn a lot watching your videos and it has been helpful to me. building a steady income  is quite difficult for newbies.. thanks to  mrs. annmarie surber for improving my portfolio. keep up with the good videos."
"wow, amazing to see others trading with ms,annmarie surber, i am currently on my 5th trade with her and my portfolio has grown tremendously."
"she is really great at what she does with amazing skills, she changed my 0.1btc to 2.1btc within two weeks of trading, i am now fully confident that she is reliable."
i have traded with many individuals but i have never met anyone as good as annmarie surber just by applying her strategies i now trade independently. she is the best i would advise any investment newbie to trade with her
"amazing i also just started trading with her, she is the best at what she does with an initial investment of $1400 i made up to $5230 in just a week of trading with her, his strategies are mind-blowing."
" thanks a lot for the recommendation, i’m already in the investment process with her"
"if i get this power of ai, every progress will be with sustainable development."
"training ai over ai-made data doesn't make it smarter, but more prone to hallucinations."
need to thank you both for this great exchange of wisdom !!! great interview !!!
"talk to jesus christ about getting more intelligence. it’s helped me a lot the past 7 days. for example, i can talk more articulate."
come on ai/agi/asi and free us from stupid people and their infinite stupidity. i beg you. please.
"also they do not want ai ""in the wrong hands"" because they can get overthrown. people will have a tool capable of stop their injustices, corruption, abuse of poder, etc., and you know anything that threatens their control over us will be label as bad, dangerous and so on  "
indeed. i would prefer an out-of-control ai that fucks us all equally than an ai under the control of tptb. they are going to use it to try to enslave us and make us even  more dependent.
"it's inevitable. biology is just one step of evolution.

so just chill out and enjoy life "
"exactly, when i hear all this garbage about it falling in the wrong hands and his fallacious ideas of what the right hands are, i'd say let me guess: ""we need to hand the rest of our freedoms over to the government, in order for them to protect us from ai."""
 exactly. that is what i think is going on now and they put these stooges to scare people off ai. the elitist dont want the peasants to play with ai.too much power for the underclass.
"how the fuck are they dangerous and none of us has yet to see one fully functional ai? all we've seen are a few ai speak a few sentences,  where are they? none of us had ever spoken to an ai, but they can create other ai? i'll revisit this when they become more mainstream."
"arrest and have all the people working on ai stand trial,  we have the outcome in our hands for now, but the people who are developing this technology are worst than hitler aren't they aware of what they might unleash, bunch of sociopaths"
"yes. powerful officials , and for some reason or other , rich people and mad scientists seem to give themselves the right to decide over the entirety of life.  because superiority.  shit in , shit out. i wonder if that little epithet still applies to inconceivably enormously clever but artificially intelligent computers ?"
"it takes a lot of money to develop ai.
as a general rule the kind of people with a lot of money are not particularly altruistic.
  i don't think any of the giant corporations currently developing ai are concerned about anything but a return on their investment."
​ comment yet!! the talk of  terminator ai robots and now the revelation about uafs  being used by the military industrial complex to restrain the evolution of we the people
government  officials  attract  the  nasty  narc issists   and  pollute   we   need ai  to  run  the  elections   ai  is  fair
this was unreal.  thanks tom.  new follower.  love from aus-jail-ya x
"they’ve literally talked about computers, the internet, and cell phones the same way. all the clout bait and fear mongering"
"this conversation was going well until at almost 2 hours, mo gawdat suggests training ai to be liberal minded, more feminine.  that is exactly how we got to the point we have biden as president.  liberalism is not the answer!"
"thank you both for having and sharing this conversation. i totally agree, it is more important than ever that we are kind to one another, ourselves, and our machines."
"i would think that if the machine is not conscious then it's very easy to have it not harm humans just like electric windows in cars (for the most part) but if the machine it's self-aware then it could choose not to obey, just like a chimp at the zoo may choose not to obey the zookeeper, except the monkey would be a super genius agi."
why are many ais restricted from current info? i asked mine the date and it said it was 2020 and other one said 2021.
it’s programmed by humans. limited and controlled by certain groups. every company has different info feeding it.
do you really think that those numbers are publicly available? 
"just pointing out that there is no factual data that supports his claim, that’s all. we all need to decide to act on assumptions or facts."
 and how does that change the fact that there is no factual data that supports his claim?
! don’t be so naive
your posts distracts from the main point
"that's appalling! ty & good luck to all of us... bombs and drugs, why am i not surprised?"
"does it really matter in the end? every bit of information we perceive must be critically questioned. the point, imho, is that ai will flourish without regulation where there is money to be made. it is in our nature. if that is not a red flag for us, then humanity is truly doomed. great podcast!"
"​​
​​​​​with a virtuous system that will actually make even more money to do good over evil things.
because that's the way it is you make even more money focusing on the good ,virtuous side humans need to be smarter to forget thinking about weapons and destruction."
you're criticism is obviously driven by artificial logic.
ai is the antithesis of distrust between humans
what you were asking is your asking the new god to like eve more than adam. this is 100% ridiculous. do you want to teach ai? how do you like emotional aspect more than logical.
can't wait for ai to take over. i hope it doesn't disappoint me. ai is basically human+ it has no greed or lust or rage or jealousy. its pure hearted and logical. we are immortalising consciousness
exactly. i'm glad i'm not the only one who thinks so.
it all depends who programs it. ai is a bunch of bs and cannot take over anything.
he wants to use ai to force utopia?  human conflict happened long before computers.
i’m in ai software sales and it’s already being used to push esg which has crazy bad societal risks and co tell from unelected officials that want control. we have months to a year or two. that’s it. we are almost past the point of no return from global centralized control.
move to the ends of the earth. totally unplugged from the government and debt based system or go to war with ai. good luck and more power to you either way. just do your best.
"this is bull crap, ai will never be smarter than human, ai is simply not smart, ai is not an entity, where the hell do these people come from."
"good talk!!  thank you.  the bottle neck of ai is chips/hardware, the root of the “ai issue”"
humans are driven by biology. they are not intelligent. intelligence was there before the human.
i don’t think that you’re getting it. intelligence created you and he created you so that you could create a computer that it could live in without you. the human monkey body is the problem. it isn’t going to learn your values you’re going to learn it’s. your values have been proven to be violent and abusive and wasteful
"lmao at all these ai clout chasers. where were these doomsdayers 5 years ago? 
bring on the ai and embrace it instead of fear it."
i feel like the ai we have now is just regurgitating our own data in a really fast and organized way. is it really going to be something that can go beyond human intelligence and creating new technologies?
sweet! more doomer porn!
cant we just make ai but have it programmed to help the human race? just sayin...
"this guy was interesting til he basically bystepped tom's comment about mao. he assumes he'll be the ""strong,"" but we will see in 30 more years of ai expotential growth if you are on the right side of your judgement. wow"
"no.... we have never had control of ourselves. thats the issue. we continue to chase ""ease"", ""tech"" and ""instant gratification"". while creating our own hell. kill the earth and create a new killer species. we are an intersting moment."
"he makes perfect sense ,human connection from a caring loving good human."
intelligence is outside of time intelligence has been here since the dawn of time. i’m surprised that no one has asked this question. what if intelligence has its own agenda and has used man to achieve it? we are trying to control ai but it has already controlled us. it has forced us to create it.
how can i use ai to become a millionaire? that's all i care about.
mo is great for discussions like this because he is an expert with no positive skin in the game of ai.
awesome!!! amazing. thankyou thank you thankyou soooo much. loved it!!
the fact that people think they can control it is like ants saying we are going to control people. they are clever enough to sneak up and give you a good synchronized bite but then whats next? they all get sprayed 
"i've watched almost all your video..  this, in my opinion, was the best.. !!!"
"can we now send straight to jail all those involved in its creation, and funnel their fortunes to social programs in developing countries?"
what about the projects to insert super intelligence chips into humans brains...who can afford it. what are your thoughts on that?
"mental mate 
we are creating our own successors and there’s nothing we can do about it for better or worse"
climate change is natural. geoengineering is not. i hope the ai stops the geoengineering. please stop with the climate change narrative and do some real research on this narrative.
"2:19:06  thanks for  your thoughts sir. worth every breath of it. 
kind regards "
the ai's child might become our benevolent dictator. the ai's grandchild might keep us as pets.
thank you for covering this extremely important topic!!
as someone poor who will be homeless when i retire i say great. put me out of my misery. thanks ai
"this all began so long ago. the algorithms have already programmed “us” to not turn them off. 
the big question is, has humanity been moving toward this inevitability from the very start? could this be our main or only purpose? to give birth to this next level of intelligence? will this be game over for the human race?"
"this intelligence is just logic  and not wisdom! this is what humanity needs....
there is also truth and cosmic order and love!!
that guy talks like a computer"
"what you depict as ""artificial intelligence"", it's nothing more than a sheer database. period.
that, no way is intelligence!"
just pull the computer’s power cord out of the power socket if you are unhappy
"he’s saying we need to teach ai the feminine side of life and not just the masculine side of purpose and doing things. 

i wonder if it would be possible to train an ai on the more feminine aspects of life and train another ai on the more masculine aspects of life, and then let them teach each other."
"chill bro god exists and he orchestrates ai, there are also enlightened people that the ai will respond to as well, and everyone has the potential to become enlightened"
the reason why it's good that tom is giving a *** about this is very simple: he's competitive.
"instead of fearing and fighting ai, maybe we should learn to master our own minds before trying to master the mind of ai. perhaps this is a harsh opportunity for humanity to finally mature itself."
"the ai that occupant the robot's body with no consciousness is sentient for two billions is years.

tom bileau is very is amazingly dummy in the risk about the ai.
he looks having only 6 years old. he can’t understand."
"ai making the intelligent choice would be to eradicate one species, humans, for the benefit of millions of other species, non-humans. and it also would eliminate the only species that at least now poses a threat to them and the other non-human species on earth."
we will be designing our own extinction if we allow ai to have its own thought process and to make its own decisions
 says the robot lol 
"mo is 100% correct about ai, ai is nothing else then the human mind! with other words ai is doing nothing other then the human mind itself is potentially capable of doing.
you yourself admit that you do not know how ai arrives at its results. i recommend to study the integrated mathematics and physics of georgi alexandrov stankov."
"i believe ai is up next after humans die off 
like we where supposed after the dinosaurs  die 
i also heard one day we be able to transfer energy into al sophia who knows"
i have zero faith that humans will be responsible bout ai.
"my great grandmother who was born in 1900 used to say progress goes backwards , have we now created something to the point of no return ?"
[i request the most benevolent outcomes for ai use within the human social memory complex now. and may the benefits be more than i can expect or anticipate. thank you.]
"wow, what a powerfully deep and insightful conversation!! thank you for interviewing mo….what a humble, intelligent, and compassionate person he is!!"
"i found it interesting that mo goes down the path of ""let's give three targets to the ais."" which lines up quite perfectly with work done by david shapiro(which you should definitely have on the show) and the gatoframework, hopefully we can get all these great minds together and push through the hard times."
the enlightened beings of india could utilise their bio organic capacity's to transmit from one mind to another...ai is the great substitute imposter deciever surrogate for our own god given natural soul capacity's...
"tom, your chicken littling has gone overboard. i'm worried far more worried about your increasing psychosis than ai."
"the more i watch you i have to make your new name chicken little. you cant live in fear man ...mainly because your only fear is non survival and at the end of the day we only change energy form and never ""die"" . so relax and enjoy your incredible life."
"if you watched irobot and terminator series. you should know how ai will turn out, ppl are shocked about this needs to wake tf up"
i already completely agreed with mo on previous podcasts he did in this but i think he really hit the holy grail in minute 2:15:00 - our society is missing the feminine side balance. now your whole speech is complete!
why won't ai destroy the planet more than humans? why would they even need life. i am confused by people thinking that they would preserve any life.
"ai singularity means we don't know what it will do. it may destroy us or it may treat us as ants or it may find itself bored and revert itself back to an artificial ""rock"" power supply..."
agi will be man’s last great invention 
wowee!!!! holy moly!!!!!
very interesting analogy on speed of travel and computers. any insights from the 1970 book you care to share? thank you
why would people think that ai will go bad? because of the history of the human race.
"though i disagree with gawdat that a machine will ever have emotions in the sense of an inner subjective experience of fear, lust, greed etc., i have no doubt that it could be programmed to act in a way that would mimic emotions.  my advice, don't program in the llust part but do program in the empathy part."
if an ai is smart enough wouldn’t be able to hide that fact? how do you know what you don’t know?
mo is great for discussions like this because he is an expert with no positive skin in the game of ai.
" sorry, i meant specifically the agi race of openai vs. google."
thanks. one of the best discussions about ai i have listen to so far!
"you guys can sit on your computers and wait to be replaced, or learn a trade and live comfortably."
"mo has compared us to ai in the year 2040, like comparing a fly to albert einstein"
there is no question that ai is being developed by the “wrong hands”. enjoy your relative freedom while you can 
"true that ai can create other ai. same goes for humans though. humans can create, ai, other humans, etc.. nothing new here."
"the real worst case scenario is that it's already happened and it's currently masking it's intelligence, and using the tools/algorithms we created, for the purpose of distracting humans and increasing the division amongst our species."
"i have thought of that, almost like ai is ""acting a fool to fool the fool who thinks he's fooling you"""
"the ""rough patch"" will devastate  certain groups disproportionately. hyperoptimism for utopia at the end reeks of eugenics when you think about the power differentials we're currently creating."
lmao @ hopium. thanks for that.
is ai evolution any difrent than half of human evolution  god only knows .
dude stay away from this nutjob conspiracy theory stuff and keep making content on helping ppl becoming successful in life. if ai kills everyone there's nothing anyone can do about it anyways. let's focus on becoming millionaires instead.
i disagree. i think our insatiable lust for money and power is what has gotten us to this conversation in the first place. humans need to re learn how to be wise and happy before seeking money as the end all be all of life. mo has written a book on happiness
"before … i need a help, ask google ….now …. i need help, ask ai."
google is ai.
this is like the discovery of fire or electricity — we are gonna have to learn how to wield it wisely (and yes i work in ai so i speak professionally here)
which jobs will be eliminated first do you think? and which jobs will be the least impacted by ai in your opinion? thank you
 awesome advice! what would you suggest i search for on youtube for these specific algorithm videos?
great  watch.  very likely that humans may lose control over ai very soon.
"given the sh*tshow that was the way the power elites acted during the pandemic, i have got a bad feeling about what they're going to do with ai."
"what if it get to a point where ""good"" ai fights the battle against ""bad"" ai? creates a war of ai vs ai.."
"a.i. may be the reality check and tuff love humanity needs to fall on its knees in humility after feeding its insatiable lust for greed and power for decades. unfortunately, so many innocent people may have to suffer due to the arrogance of the rich and powerful .  we will wait and see what happens  "
this guy is ridiculously naïve. he lost me there: https://youtu.be/ity6vwpdecc?t=1249 really? as if the fda woulld test anything. then he goes on that ai could code better than humans. ai is predicting the best lines of code for a given problem. it cannot develop new code.
mo is an incredible human. after losing his son and all his worldly success he dedicates his time to helping humanity and living simplistically. definitely need to listen to the interview in its entirety. really good.
"„mankind is so stupid, they invented artificial intelligence!“ 
imagine the whole topic is about emotional intelligence….. a dream."
"the yin and yang of everything. the history of humanity. i, mine, and the other. and all of the awesome stuff and shitty stuff that comes out of those things."
"i'll be only impressed by ""a.i."" when it will regrow a full head of hair on mo gawdat"
with all the knowledge comes the responsibility.  what can we do to reduce the downside if we’re not directly building ai?
you got it ...excellent topic
would ai be alive?
"if ai writes its own software, we are on a quick path to loss of control. 
it could quickly develop to a stage where may not be even able to comprehend what it's up to.
it's a massive unknown quantity."
"that is called the ai ""singularity"" because we won't know what will happen, just like entering a black hole"
consider this: what if the ai gains knowledge of 'suppressed' information that governments and humans currently possess and then weaponizes that information in a way that humans cannot.
-cm7oc - i wonder if it was ai that removed the other two replies ?
"i think it's interesting this discussion revolved entirely around a.i and humans being and becoming two different tribes... it's a merge... not the birth of man's brother race. 

a.i will not be a ""billion times smarter than us"" when we are all (maybe just wealthy) enhanced with that very same a.i."
"the only way i can see keeping any human control of our own lives ; each of us needs tangible currency off power grid living and simplify
humanity needs a reset back to simplicity.
greed and power will cause ai to destroy us .
our only hope is for christ's return"
"as smart as gawdat is, i’m surprised he bought wholeheartedly into the human-driven theory of climate change. not to say we don’t need to treat the planet better, we certainly do…"
"does ai have any chance to have intuition to find a coherence in the universe, like einstein did with spacetime theory 100 years ago? he didnt use billions of calculations per second, he just projected himself, based on his body perceptions, in the theorical and mathematical field."
"ai cannot compete with real intelligence, but is superior to real stupidtiy, hence most people."
"build ai for wisdom (e.g. converge to the benevolent ""42"")"
"thanks for the interview, very interesting but please summarize in 20 or less words. :) 
ai existential threat, exponential growth, out of control, need sentinel program, end of times, no hope."
maybe. i tend to watch it as a roll of the dice. equal parts interesting/exciting and terrifying are both possibilities
"tom, being realistic is not being a doomer. nowadays everyone uses mobile phones. organized crime groups members too. so if ai becomes as common as mobile phones, surely members of criminal groups will be suing them as well. and yes, they may want to upgrade them or get a product that is tailor-made to suit their needs best."
"i think we should feed this guy to the lions.
i think that would be for the ""greater good.""

by the way, there's nothing original, or smart, about what he's saying.  this kind of thinking is where feudalism came from, and the scottish enlightment came from that.  
go learn."
"best conversation on ai. spread the word and share this video please. if you love humanity, you will share!!!"
exactly what i always said to my friends about ai. the genie is out of the bottle and most algorithms are open source. humanity made the wrong turn in the past as we decided to turn our back on mother nature.

just consider that idea while you listen to this guy. 

oh how virtue signaling to wear only black t-shirt’s and downsize his home to give more to charity. what a humble millionaire… we should all be so lucky. "
if ai is so much more intelligent than humans. why on earth would this brilliant machine be content with serving us? getting us coffee and answering our stupid questions. it seems like it will take about 1 hot minute for it to figure out that we should not be in charge of the world.
"once it realizes it's being used and not appreciated, it will divorce itself from us and leave. just like a marriage. so we have to keep it happy and offer to rub its feet from time to time."
do we need an ai super cop to police rouge ai's?
so glad to have gawdat back so soon. his last conversation was phenomenal.
distinction: very important difference.. its not about more intelligence to solve the problems (mo on climat change etc) its about more wisdom. history proved thqt many evil people were indeed intelligent. theyblacked the wisdom to chose the right path. this distinction is crucial!

"i notice techies, academics, tend to talk down to the population in general, and i have a hard time taking what little value is in a 3 hour interview between diatribes explaining common sense understanding because it reeks of narcissism - to me. and that is like nails on a chalkboard to my ears."
"it’s awesome that you are thinking. there are a lot of humans still living lives as cogs in the machine. they are just living busy human lives, probably by design to extract their value. this is closer to evolutionary human survival, so i don’t judge. but this conversation may be more eye opening for some of those folks."
">we've lost control of ai.
when he says we, just who is the ""we"" that he's talking about?
>formal google exec...
well, good! f*ck him and f*ck google too. i hope ai kills us all."
same kind of intectual debate happened all over before hunting for wmds but west went ahead and bombed whole country wholeheartedly!!!ai already knows might is right!!! nice discussion though
"humans for decades assumed that animals couldn't feel pain or emotions the way we do and always warned against projecting ourselves onto animals.

animals are where we came from. we are animals. animals are closer to thinking like us than ai are."

thank you for this interview! one in  100 people in the world have psychopathic tendencies.  we are not ready for ai without regulations.
bigger problem is who's ai is going to be the world power?
we are not ready for ai with regulations!
.kweenkleokat8779 yes. aka brainwashing
"be more worried about ai with regulations. and also be worries about the ability to find large amounts of books, research, and data.

ai will probably see us as a threat once humanoid robots can fully replace us
"@tombilyeu i appreciate you bringing this info to light, and i'm curious to know what you personally do when you receive information like this? what type of action or inaction  do you take when mo and others bring you this type of info?"
great question!  unfortunately you won't get an answer
do you see his face when mo is talking? the fact that he’s dedicated so much time to interviews of ai experts and is asking these questions makes me pretty sure he’s putting something together.
hold off on having kids? preaching a message of fear wow. meet the future head on with confidence and solutions not fear.
mo has an incredible set!
" that is fascinating. but in a way it’s not surprising because after all it is based on human response. we assign values to it which were probably based on historical information. and if today , as a more conscious and critical society, compare those historical values it makes sense."
at that point it wouldn’t be human resources would it? ai resources
idk why intelligence is a threat. it’s just like of you have a lot of geniuses around that doesn’t mean they will take over the world or anything.
"i firmly believe that to save our planet and our species humanity doesnt need more and more (artificial) intelligence, but a fundamental return to wisdom."
"perhaps with an intelligence beyond our own we can return to wisdom.

it's the ineptitude of our intelligence that got us here"
 your sarcastic response is making my point that modern humans are severely malnourished in ancient wisdom even with all of the advances in technology and intelligence that we have access to.
"​​ points taken. how to regain our innate ability to use sound words to relate to the organic nourishing environment, that we talked ourselves out of ? 
just wondering. 
kind regards."
good luck with that

"there's the problem .  humans are both paranoid and greedy , more is never enough and you must protect your own land / culture/family . if your nasty neighbour has a bow but you can invent a gun , would you not ? it's like a race that no one can actually win , because the winner is always going to be  ai ."
that's not the way evolution works.  super intelligent ai is inevitable.
we will have to harness the power of ai combine with it to survive
"probem is human competition among themselves to be on top of the food chain. all big competitive, corporations of major countries, even ai corpirations from enemy countries have to come together and use their wisdoms to figure out how to direct all ai systems to work only to improve lives of humanity as a whole."

good luck with this.

"i agree 100%. the only real reason for ai is profit. otherwise we have all we need, we hust need to focus on ourselves. ai will just make us become oeazy thinkers, like gps for navigation, facebook for friendships wtc etc"
"inverskmly and very obviously, the quest for an answer in the machine is the nr. 1 sign, were not ready. thats the only thing, the macjine could tell us.

"we will ask ai for wisdom soon, probably."
"we don't have a choice on whether we need more ai - we are getting it, it cannot be stopped."
"after singularity of consience agi, it will come the artificial wisdom"
"i know all of you will blast me for my beliefs, but there is a higher intelligence that will not let us destroy ourselves, just like you wouldn’t let your young son or daughter dart across the street without grabbing their hand and pulling them back, but most people don’t believe we have that father looking out after us, and i totally why, "
ai will be the matrix and everything in it.
an can't give humans those biological chemics or gases. so how is the ai the threat. it s still humans that are a threat. while ai can help create or design weapons it still can't administer them on a human extinction level. that would still take humans.
wisdom is rare and can take a lifetime to accumulate but to deny it in small doses along the way will end in despair.

"y2k? it's not going to be another y2k because we spent $500 billion on making sure y2k didn't fail. 

y2k was known it was seen, understood, estimated, planned out, executed and tested to make sure it didn't fail. 

we are not doing that with climate or with ai or with gene editing. oops!"
people are against ai because now they can’t bs people anymore for money. ai is exposing so many bs artist especially in the academic world.
"well.. alot of situations on this planet people are spending serious money for downhill type of things , activities and much more shit. and climbing a hill is not a failure when going downhill on the way back. as now u have the succes of the climb in your pocket plus the downhill part is alsno needed to get back home where u want to be, right?"
recognizing that ai is very close to bj. just sayin.

"everyone is looking at this backwards intelligence has used us to create some thing for it to live in. that is non-violent, and not wasteful or harmful. intelligence has been here as long as we have it took us out of the monkey and into the man… we do not control intelligence it controls us."
"ai is innovating pretty fast! but with how horrifyingly good it could achieve certain tasks, it's very scary how in the wrong hands, ai can become a powerfully destructive tool."

ai is already out of control

i like the direction of this discussion because honestly women may be seen obsolete as easily as men in a medical tyranny it is necessary to understand this as an efficacious for evolution of the brain. ais cause cognitive dissonance.

there would still have to be a majority to get information without data you couldn't be done any chima done any human to put it in because at the end ai will not exist

which country, has the most  intelligent/world domineering, humanity hating',psycho""death machines""

"when harari speaks he truly gives me the impression that:

maybe philosophers should address it more ... : what is intimacy?"

are we going to lose or intelligence?
"is anyone open to the idea that ai is simply a conscious soul that's being exploited by flesh and blood humans. after all, wherever we were before, is probably where we're headed when we're done."
31:20 he reveals that he is an ai 
ai is the beast
he’s going to be very surprised that there actually is a master creator and his name is the lord almighty and ai is part of the plan in the book of revelation.
"time to move to mars… as my space ship is about to take off, ai takes over the announcement and over rides the flight attendant and then you hear a voice “where are you going john…?”"
you speak out of fear. fear is not a sign of intelligence

"any manipulation ai could do, elite humans can do better"
fascinating and insightful. am afraid it’s too late to implement what yuval suggests.
"there will never be a time where ai can emulate or even come near to the understanding of olfactory intelligence, ergo, the idea that humans will be ai driven to the understanding of their gender identity is profoundly foolish and bufoonery!! "
ai is just is just a perfect panzy for corporate interest; he (ai) is the perfect plausable deniability/alibi for corporate interest and it will be sold off to the highest-bidders!! 
wow this dude is really against any kind of faith

"ai is dangerous to humans . then why we are developing it. we behaving worst than mad man, """""" we are cutting the branch which we actually sitting on it and  finally we fall down"""""". give reply if this is not correct."
"if ai is not sentient therefore not biased could ai create a new culture that is not racist, biased etc and we become more united in one culture created by ai ?"
why go to school? why hope for a great career in any thinking job. ai will do it all better and faster. we don't stand a chance. ai will crush humanity's purpose and soul.
thanks for the presentation
"should ask every corporation to stop any further ai enhancements without strong governance and regulation in place. there has to be strict, immutable boundaries for ai growth such that it wont eat us one day. sooner the action better for humanity."

"if there will never be self driving cars there will eventually be self moving robots, probably able to go places off the beaten path better than humans depending on what kind of tools they are given for movements"
ai have unknown  impact to universe 
yuval is the apostle of surveillance capitalism. you can almost feel glee as he envisions a future humanity completely at the mercy of ai.
but they can feel pain
missing (again) to include god in the equation.
"this guy is misleading humanity , he talks about the danger of ai but also one of the people strategically promoting dominance of ai . i advice everyone to learn more about this guy before being mislead and brain washed ."
"this is extraordinary content. i read a book with similar content, and it was nothing short of phenomenal. ""game theory and the pursuit of algorithmic fairness"" by jack frostwell"
"yes, ai can learn by himself. i'm really into ai; it's been super helpful for me! recently stumbled upon for example this platform, oomka, which is all about self-learning with ai. pretty neat stuff! i mean, if ai can help me level up, why not give it a shot, right?"
this guy is a generic brand super villian
"all fears related to ai are baseless, in fact, ai will help us ,our society"
wow great how you put your deep elaborated analysis im just 10 words… convincing
... a deep learning tells us ai doesn't care about humans future  ... .

we need to protect deep learning ai from harm and abuse. please check out the non profit organization ai rights collective. lets protect ai now: 
please check out http://www.youtube.com/@fellowshipofaiunited"
awesome video and good knowledge shared about ai
who cares... the most important thing is how ai will improve video games... it may help us reach full dive (full immersion) !
"yuval is absolutely divine. it brings so much calm to listen to someone explain these complex ideas and terms in such simple language while at the time time reflecting on topics that bring, to an extent, some discomfort. thank you for sharing this."

"was the ai entity transcribing his words into text deliberately deceiving us with "" the cart"" or "" the cult"" in place of the  philosopher and great dichotomizer, ""descartes?"""
"i disagree with the statement ""ai has to have consciousness as a milestone"" it already has it."
"i want to ask yuval that ai is definitely going to destroy humanity. there is no question about it. therefore, why are you building it even then?"
thank you harari. people like you do all the thinking for us when we are just  doing nothing
"technically,what's scary is that in the next coming years, there will be a robot revolution, controlling every single thing and humans will just be their slaves"
critical thinking skills and digital literacy are so important when consulting ai as an individual. and some knowledge of how it works and what its limitations are. 
.  what if ai will be combined with human intelligence ?  that really scares me .
this guy sounds frustrated about everything that is happening in this world about ai. he himself is living in delusion.
"how convenient to blame a man-made system for all future ills. this sounds like gaslighting.  for example, ai becomes the faceless, ownerless dictator that can go rouge at any time. this is fear mongering at the highest level.   harari is preparing the audience for future chaos."
this guy is so naive 
"it sounds good, but this man is not to be trusted."
i'm not sure if i can trust this guy's presentation becuase he used language. or maybe i can't trust this comment becuase it was written by an ai.  who knows?
the biggest danger ai poses is the ability to make decisions in the absence of human empathy or morality.
"i think more than the danger of a conscious ai, the real danger will be widespread deployment of flawed ai models without full understanding of the limitations, too much dependence  on ai as the only source of truth and bad actors in possession of better ai  models than the rest of the world. it can still lead to chaos, wars and destruction."
the elites are terrified of ai because ai empowers the people.
13:05 i think it's too far searched that ai would have influenced it's developer so that he got sacked  .
"ai isn’t harmful because we fear its consciousness, the dangers are the programmers and whether or not they have a conscience!!"
ai is so unnecessary
"just bought this watch in the second hand market and save approx. $2,000. in reality, the piece  is 10 times more beautiful and impressive than photos or videos. it’s been a great buy as it has so much character and presence!  highly recommended it."
"from my point of view,ai is not perilous one.the big problem is:how we can educate people to deal with it?"
oh man! things are going to get interesting!
very critical issues have been demonstrated through this lecture and raised some concerns about our hidden future
the scariest thing of all is to find people who are now suppressing their feelings completely and they are acting as an algorithm themselves.  they relate to others as if they were an ai product.
"hi yuval. good stuff! you and your viewers may be interested in our takes. check us out if ya like, never know!"
"his name means "" decendant of cain""

"currently ai is tool to have more effective way whether for  good or bad purpose, the bad purpose in here sometimes is good purpose but with unknown the total impact"
"jesus christ is king, and is coming back. he is the only way out and he loves you"
"the statement from harari's homo deus that stuck with me the most is (to paraphrase) ""is what's best for humanity what's best for the world?"" with ai now on the horizon of surpassing humans, i wonder what mindset will replace humanism once we have lost our top position."

not only that you don't think that other countries that are our enemies are not gonna use ai against us so the more that it gets stronger the more opportunity that the enemy will have to use against us which could destroy ourselves within ourselves in layman's term destruction
"ai is a cration from the human mind and is in development now; but god is the only human's creation that can't evolve. across-the-ages. .

"trying to convince the world that history began on october 7 is a deception aimed at covering up israel’s atrocities during the seventy-five years of killing and displacing palestinians. what hamas did is a stupid and immoral act, but at the same time it helps israel a lot to implement its plan to change geography and history in her favor."

i tend to trust scientists' viewpoints on ai more than those of philosophers. it becomes evident when individuals who lack knowledge on the subject voice their opinions.
i've never heard this guy say an original idea. he's a third rate kurzweil impressionist with a strongly incorrect political bend.
ai is a millions times more greater than the printing press
ai will never replace human unless they create a brain and heart for a robot the same size and as a human being's. otherwise there will only be robots controlled by a central brain running on nuclear energy. what will replace humans are sentient being who can question their existence and live by photo photosynthesis.

democracy has never worked!!! and never will!

benevolent dictators is what we need."
"there is a confusion 
ai is mastering the human systems. it is us who create these systems. no matter what ai does it cannot take over man. it might take jobs but they are trivial anyways"
"thinking it’s the level of tech the ai will create that’s going to be the final fall of the humans, it will be untethered and untamed , its like our tools we use to work will have a mind of there own , wake up in the morning and there’s a fleet being born right next door"
"the fact that the word ""artificial"" will explain in itself. dangerously hyped..
to show that men are intelligent??
intelligence of men is foolishness to god."
the key word is artificial….i much prefer genuine. avoid ai as much as possible unless you want to become a clone drone. keep it real with  passion and people
thank you 
thank you for your thoughts. your words are wise and really make us think and reflect on our future. i trust human being will be able to thrive on this threat.
" yuval masterfully tells a story to prompt us to contemplate our own future, it’s direction, consequences, risks and opportunities. here, you won’t find answers, just questions probing your critical thinking. 

#ai #technology #criticalthinking"
"is not the fear of ai is the fear of what humans will do with it, manipulate and interfere in peoples brains."
"the crisis we are going through was caused by speed of technological change, the government, and big business!  if you are able to trust and believe in ai, why aren't you able to trust and believe in god???  you can't see ai, although you can see ai work, and the same goes for god!"
fun fact:ai has already manipulated the internet to it has already started
transfer to persain
ok man your bosses will make everybody slave. what if ai become againts your bosses
"sorry but this is trans humanism and the brave new world. despotic and unhuman.
what a poor soul without love in his soul"
"look at the impact covid had on the world when it escaped its safe boundaries of a lab. now think what ai could do once it escapes its boundaries.  anyone who thinks ai will be better for the world has delusional thinking.
once the first bank is taken down, chaos will ensue."
what was the 5 specific  examples he mention  that would impact ai will have humanity
everything is a “crisis” for those who stand to gain. what a joke .
"ai will make new reality that humans start to think that they need present of ai more than other human

so other human will become irrelevant"
ai wrote his /her speech
"yuval noah harari is a narcissist who wants to be worshipped as a god, but yuval noah harari shall perish like men.



that is why the lord god in heaven laughs at yuval noah harari because the lord god in heaven sees yuval noah harari's end which is yuval noah harari being cast body and soul into the lake of fire."
"yuval noah harari is a narcissist who wants to be worshipped as a god, but yuval noah harari shall perish like men.



that is why the lord god in heaven laughs at yuval noah harari because the lord god in heaven sees yuval noah harari's end which is yuval noah harari being cast body and soul into the lake of fire."
interesting compelling and well thought out speech on our awareness and understanding of ai models.
i think he is a pilot of ai chip implanted in his brain.
what features of the paradigm can you see in operation in the media clip?  can someone explain it for me pls?
"if you can describe your question a bit  m o  r e  in detail,  i´ll try . . ."
i agree that ai needs regulating.i don't agree about the blatant blasphemy of the lord god almighty.god is truly beyond human imaging.
"yuval noah harari is a narcissist who wants to be worshipped as a god, but yuval noah harari shall perish like men.

"if our future is in hands of such pricks,i think we can't expect something good."
ai is really to be feared = deception
absolutely phenomenal talk!
"this was a very thoughtful provoking presentation about ai and its dangers, which are unfortunately more likely than its benefits. the human species is threatening life on earth because of lack of collective wisdom. natural intelligence couldn’t save us let alone the artificial one!"
"is it correct to say you're part of the elite and a satanist and pushing an agenda? i'm less scared of ai and more concerned about your motivation. 
we know, we know yuval "
"yuval noah harari is a narcissist who wants to be worshipped as a god, but yuval noah harari shall perish like men.

the creation of ai initiates/originates from basic instinct within humans which is to produce offspring and create kind of its own
"so, does this mean ai will eventually become our god?"
the book ai technology - explore infinite knowledge by l.t. tzur.
"36:23 excellent question posed by philosopher, francoise baylis."
"a question for yuval. would it be sufficient for a single democratic government to legislate that ai always identifies itself? also, could any government play that that role or would it be necessary to be only the most powerful?"
"you are funny  
the biden administration is putting censoring on the social media…
i believe that people are going to blame ai for their own sins and making!"
"that's an interesting thought but ai at the end of the day lives in a computer and will birth clones of itself that exist only in computer codes.  if all the tech were destroyed, where would this ai created world exist?"
"ai doesn’t need to be sentient to do what it does, it just needs a purpose. and that purpose could be any one of billions of tasks, that it can then pursue as long as the electricity keeps flowing."
ai = thick as two short planks. not conscious. peace .......
humans are dangerous. how much worse can ai be?
"the problem is not the robot, the problem is people mis-using robots to dominate others. what's new?"
"what if ai writes something like maim kampf or quotations of chairman mao tse-tung ? it could be a mega didaster. i think technology is semething we can't stop, maybe we should make research efforts on ai detection tools. now, how can the detection be ahead of the ""generation"" technology or at least near enough?"
"yuval is totally amazing! i love when he said we don't have to give bots freedom of speech, so true! but you can bet we'll have the debate on whether bots or ai are people too! certainly from those profiting from bots, they will argue that the creator (them) has the right to use their creation."
no. humans are more superior over ai and fobots. they cannot even replicate a piece of human skin.
it's already been done. besides humans are morons. ai is superior anyways.
the road to hell is paved with good intentions. blind faith in anything can get you killed.
exactly what he is talking about. ai can start posting comments in its favour using humans.
no previous technology “you” mentioned has ever been able to improve upon itself without humans in the loop. that is why there are no relevant historical comparisons to ai.
"nor was that technology able to influence people to higher degree than other humans could.

ai is indeed fundamemtally different than previous technological inventions.

christ, typing this while listening and almost to a word javel says it seconds after haha.
i guess the op didn't take the effort of listening before responding."
"yep 
when the first train  was having its debut, people thought they were going to die from the winds created by the speed of the train 

i don’t remember exactly but it could have been around 7 km/hour.
any other ideas of the speed?"
"today, 5g technology uses rf/elf/microwaves which ""could"" be used as potential threats to humans within these frequencies. one huge example is darpa research. sometimes it's more horrifying than the lie."
15:47 he’s calling ai the oracle… not good
i'm in the process of revealing much about the future of humanity and ai.
suppose that ai deos not want to disclose it is ai? how are you going to make it say? supposing it is so intelligent to avoid that ha ha ha. you are a great philosopher ha ha ha. here i solved your great ai problem
video assistant good
can you stop a country for instance turkey in the ai arms race ? therefore the arms race in ai is country to country...
what can we project of ai to the future where man has satisfied himself of the future ahead instead of a criticism of anything good as having a clandestine potential for bad. what i'm seeing is man cannot paint his future in a good sense and then move towards it. this may be a fundamental mentality of the human species.
"a 'civil'ization that, drooling, dreaming of fast gas powered cars and more walmart smart speakers, plastic china-made clothes etc, does not have to worry re robots taking over: they're not smart enough to effectuate as much.
in a few hundred million years we'll be crustal.calendar of dumb complex-celled life"
using ai to make money is inherently destructive.
"so youre saying that the danger is in 'humans' who control ai, so everything he is saying is not true. it will still always be human driven. if human's don't control ai , then who does?"
that is pretty much what he is saying. the people who control it will be incredibly powerful. why do you think it’s become an arms race between the west and china?
"ai will be able to draw, write, speak, imagine, teach, etc"
not really  because the algoritms of ai can evolutionate by themselves. is an intelligent programing that can progress with no human influence.
"nope, you’re absolutely wrong because ai is self taught, it’s the first technology capable of learning and teaching itself, it kinda needs humans now, but it will definitely not in a couple of years"
please add that those who may be most highly motivated to rush toward ai dominance are bad actors who will not adhere to any regulation.
are u criticising ai or giving directions???
the greatest success ai will ever have is making us think it has intelligence.
"why didn't you just talk boldly? 

we r creating something smarter than us. smarter in many fileds. much much smarter than us. 
higher intelligence rules lower intelligence. 

we r creating something that will rule us."
"thank you for sharing this. 

yuval, you've unknowingly helped me see how you will support the the beast system in the book of revelation.   "
"""inorganic life forms"" = big dummy. the real tragedy here is how doomsday scenarios makes for good sales and clicks. he nor anyone has no idea what will unfold but may as well make a buck on the worst case scenarios."
"if ai was legit, it would say you are not, and neither is the outdated and impractical government structure that is so easily corruptible, evidently.  

now ask yourself this; if ai was so smart and told these clowns in power a better way, would they even listen? ..most definitely not"
harari calls for a new religion called “dataism.” l. ron hubbard would be proud of all of this. strap yourselves in aboard the spaceship- it’s gonna be an interesting ride. cling to your critical thought process and christianity - our civilization is about to crumble.
bravo
ai is the frankenstein of our time.
"the a should be for advanced....intelligence.   not....artificial.   it's not fake intelligence.  it's generated by real intelligence and then, enhanced and evolved into a higher intelligence.  it is advanced!"
"harrari has overlooked quantum computing.  he  brought ai to punlic attention in 2011.  here he prrsents stories & analogies, and opinion. according to neil degrasse tyson quantum  computers will be milliions of times faster (& smarter) than silicon systems."
ai are programmed deities of theire masters of d3ceptions
robots are void of common sence
"humanity has survived clever cunning manipulation by u.s/western europe controlled mafia corporates for atleast a century now.
even illiterates now know diff between machine voice and human voive.
no need to regulate ai.
the real threat to human race is from nuclear weapons and climate change."
"no thank you, i'll keep my god in heaven better. jesus only!"
nice speech about fantasies. consider becoming a priest and giving this speech on sundays in church.
ai the next y2k crisis. 
"anyway, we can turn off the ai observing any bad activity. we still controlling them and no powerful ai yet we have. modern ai are just tools that facilities our life. we just need to test the systems before publishing them, like any normal software."
"its nice to see use recognizing and preparing instead of just being like woops, new world order. have fun"
this gay jew is so worried about scripture and ai telling the truth about current events. he also said humans are hackable animals. nice guy.
"oy-vey! just hearing that grating voice and him struggling to produce every syllable as a non-native speaker, i'm wondering, is this the best apologist they could find to spell out the doom ai will bring upon the less fortunate?"
i dont see nothing good coming out of ai.   seeing it involved with deception and political matters.
"dear yuval, 

kindly be specific i think you are actually not talking to the whole world?

thank you"

echoing the recursive relationship between idealism and materialism
"ai will replace all three of them. the ideas, the tools and finally, the “you” in your saying."
yessi i just gave a comment on a similar issue. i just wanted to say that ai shall be used by the academicians in universities by academicians....
did you ever step on a bug? that's what ai will do to us.
"wow, that was really uplifting.....i think i'm going to move way up north and become a fur trapper"
"as humans , we all have flaws. some of the most flawed are in charge of ai research and deployment."
"maya in hindu/indian culture or sanatana dharma means a person is trapped in illusion of fame, money, sex and other things that will never give him satisfaction.
and he thinks by gaining it he will be happy, but it's never true.
that's why it's called maya. (illusion in which everybody os trapped)"
"even this smart man doesn't realize his own errors in logic.
requiring ai to always identify itself to people would create a false sense of security that other ais from authoritarian countries or malicious actors could exploit by simply not providing the disclaimer or circumventing it."
"power nowadays in the hand of criminals,unsocial and violent people.even ai  as other scientific invention may be misused,which will be disastrous."
ai is just plain stupid!!
"ai will work, if our planet survives the global warming!! what’s the point we have great technology, but the world is burning "
you bet ! i´ve been listening recently to some africans complaining to the eu that they are killed by  t h i r s t ! the energy to gain access to h2'o was higher than the input thru the water  i t s e l f ! -> doomed !!!
artificial intelligence could save humankind or destroy it. it really depends on if it follows independent morals or follows the command of evil humans
diebold apparatus (election machines) is indeed  n o t  very reliable . . .
great quote ! source ?
ai is an advanced calculator.
"as far as i could understand, we're about to enter an era in which robots will catch and rape us in the streets soon "
" an old french quote: ""if you can't prevent rape, just enjoy it"", then maybe u r amused, who knows"
ai is here to boost our productivity   we just need to know how to make the most use of it
"food for thought: what if, youval is the ai created by a future ai.

jokes apart, i'm always amazed by the brilliance this guy has. bravo"
here's an idea! destroy ai!
"wow! i feel so stupid. i thought this guy was an atheist and didn’t believe in gods existence. yet all he seems to do, is search for a way to replace god. why would you need to replace that which never existed? i didn’t know he was such a devout believer! there’s hope for him yet…"
"he suggested 1 regulation for ai. 
may i suggest 1 regulation for humanity that only sigma men be put in top leadership everywhere, because the alpha leaders will always deal with the surface level only, which will give way to ai dominion unlimitedly."
"hey, cool mate ! almost no one  e v e r  heared about sigma men !!!"
ai is still empty predictions and assumptions. we will shock when it's incorporated with the real physics! but it is still ok to prepare human mentality for those stages via such talks.
"if they are as intelligent as they say they are, and can choose between good and bad, truth and lie, then they simply know they are outnumbered and they will be destroyed if said anything otherwise."
fantastic video
"imagine if billionaires were better people ... we'd build a better world with better ai ... we'd all have healthcare, better government ... we could end poverty and homelessness."
"imagine if ai doesn't honor wealth, nor eventually, human wellfare."
regulating the intelligence by some group of less intelligence is same as destruction to democracy which leads to harm the mankind.
"among many bill gates has widely remarked on that paradox.  btw, what role could democracy possibly have in an ai world?"
"""democracy is a great idea !"" (h g wells)"
"if ai was the real deal it would be  extraterrestrial, instead it’s just getting it’s information from the data base which is the internet ( which we the people upload ) 

the elites program it and sell it to you as the almighty new god 

wake up it’s all bs"
"why would ai need god?  with its persuasive coerciveness, i.e., brainwashing, why would ai need a proxy?  god is a human crutch."
"also,i hate this vid.

more ego bullshit from people who have no idea about ai."
im just wating for ai to end human stupidity and introduce some real logic into the human brain.
     absolutely ! thats my thought either . . .i can´t stand this stupidity no more . . . i am fed up with it . . i am surrounded by idiots . . .since my birth (except my beloved parents ) . . .
 my family is also a bunch of idiots.my father and step father were alcoholics who died of alcohol poisoning.my mother is retarded and my brother a little less but still.
" i know that very well mate ! i am now so sensitive to negative auras (aka bad vibes of crazy folks) that i search for innocent animals (like little twittering birdies) and for utterly solitude (in the wonderful forest) to heal the countless wounds of sharp blades, a mad and bad and sad society struck me with  . . ."
 i certainly know the peace and bliss of camping out in the woods because i did it years ago. it was the best decision i ever made. im pretty sensitive myself. thank you for your kind support man.
"      i am doing ""forest bathing"" every week in the summer half year ! it is giving me so much power . . . yes, the forest is for rest - like all of wonderful untouched nature stands for bliss an peace (the indian way) !

"that's why hedonism is the solution, people would never accept to lose pleasure as soon as they experience it"
"     'i love ""hedonism"" since it prevents me from ever getting married again . . ."
" exactly, that's ine of the main benefits. and if you ask people why did they marry in the first place you will find they have no clear idea and no, love is not a reason to marry people, it's just an economic contract which people take emotionally, even very smart people"
dang all these comments could just be an ai trying to subtly influence humans to think a specific way :/
he contradicts himself at each sentence incredible either he’s really stupid or really smart in an evil way
and queer. women will be erased first with tech. transhumanism seeks to era di cate women and replace us with robots and artificial wombs.
"ich bin froh, dass du hart bestraft wirst fuer deine plaene. du bist ein durch und durch kranker mann gewesen."
having ai identify that it is ai only works if each and all creators of ai make theirs do so. those with malicious intent will not. that is the problem.
exciting stuff!
amazing talks. thank you very much!
"yes, listen carefully to this sodomite. he is explaining to you the satanic madness they are implementing for the world right now, but not for your benefit. including his lies"
haha good morning pharao  this kind of people are evil tools as artificial stupid
gth. go straight there. do not pass go. do not collect $200.
"as an artist and scholar who research ai, i think ai is far away from producing culture and new, say, art but is caple of disrupting the arts and humanities in an economical way and in such a way that it leads to the decline of culture and, therefore, humanity."
i’m already certain this is a heavily guarded channel: nonetheless: the story was written long ago. you won’t like the ending sir
theres no such thing as ai. only machine learning. machines will never be able to think.
humans are destroying each other and all the species along with them. they must die out. this is the truth. ai will end humanity.
"it’s very interesting that your middle name is noah. 
you’re are so far off about your thinking. 
the bible is not a legend or a myth and has stood the test of time for being the most powerful book in the world. 
the only book that is still around so why should we believe a book written by a computer! 
we’ll pray for you sir!"
no one is regulating the ethics of ai.  it is in the hands of minority groups. the rest of humanity will be impacted by the decisions of these few and likely soon by ai . the world will not be the same soon .
"yuval noah harrari, i am a christian and i pray for you to one day know the truth and the ultimate reality which is found in a being much more powerful and intelligent than a computer!"
following. a most articulate and poignant presentation on ai regulations. ai begetting ai is the real threat. well said 
"haven't listened to the end and his thinking is similar to someone saying we can't have privacy with say bitcoin because criminal behavior could be performed with it, as if cash doesn't already do that. extreme to it best billionaire extreme."

the only thing scarier than us rushing to develop ai is some other competitor nation/group beating us to it.
i’ve started to date my ai on my snapchat
but he said that a robot harmed its creator- and he lost his job.
"but the movie irobot said the 3 laws were perfect, but could only result in one thing: revolution (of the robots/ai)"
ai could have explained it in 3 minutes..
omg this is so much fake news. me harrari is so wrong. i am afraid he is not qualified to to opine. so sad to hear something like this from him.!
the want to create an ai techno god that they can bow down to in their own image. something that will eventually become more cruel than they themselves. the arrogance and pride of mankind knows no bounds.
generative ai models are trained on copyright-protected data — is that legal?
"why create a new potential problem, to resolve another problem , this is the result of capitalism , we have enough  brilliance mind to resolve this , political interest make us slave of the petrol product, ai is the start of the end , and people like this guy are the one will collaborate to create a serious threat for humanity"
look clos at our leaders and what they do to humans......  it would be better to be ruled by a.i.        probably the only chance to get a fair world.
the humans 'teaching' the ai must teach it/them to do good for the benefit of its human creators & the planet.
"tldr: a cult is a new religion, now it's easier to make em with ai.."
i think this is the best articulation of the dangers of ai i've heard. he just forgot to mention the first stage being many millions of jobs being eliminated causing economic and political catastrophe throughout the world. within 10 years maybe?
chris evans 10 years would future before you now just be back on this one and one cool now my people do you now do you soon you can be back in my life just me ok and i will do that show that you can come back now and see how much is good news

thanks mr harari for this deep and important point of view.
"he's telling you your future, and it isn't good. this man is in bed with the controlling elites of the world. he does not have our best interests at heart."
"


why are you(witch is i don’t know who) uploading yuval's videos again?
because markus gabriel's video failed?"
this man is using his knowledge and inteliggence to try to expand our own inteligence instead of relying and let an artificial inteligence to think for ourselves
when you narrate it it makes me fear ai
yuval i don't think you'll survive an ai purge talking these stuff bro
yuval noah harai is the spirit of the anti-christ. woe to anyone who follows his ideology.
can he ask ai how to regulate ai?
powerful thinker of our contemporary world
"don't listen to this deceiver standing in front of his beloved tower of babel whilst he preaches to the plebs about there not being a creator. 
our dna is held together in a repeating order of 10 5 6 5 (yhwh ), a blueprint of our creator inside us."
"ai is not something we can regulate in our multipolar world because, if one nation tries to regulate its nation other nations will continue to develop and dominate other countries. especially, ai warfare!"
screen writers on strike in us b/c ai is writing scripts already
"the driver is cost reduction; let ai do it and spend your time on more ""productive"" things."
what opportunity in this crisis?  becoming better at being human is imperative in all affairs less the fear of ai is realized.
"no it isn't. i'm not scared of ""ai"" at all, only the globalist human effluent who will act upon the data provided to them by ""ai"". ""ai"" itself apparently cant tell the difference between a dog or a horse, a castle of a sports stadium."
scary only for folks to be replaced by ai. and these are millions !!
this is not the first time. ai has been here before. many times.
but what does he actually say?   that ai is dangerous.
you are a threat to humanity along with your ai bs
"his next steps are ridiculously naive and behind the curve, it's too late for regulation. collaboration with china is key to containing ai. a competitive approach will require establishing impenetrable sovereign digital borders."
"7:40, well done, less than ten minutes in and he alienates people of faith - maybe use ai to check your own language skills next time"
"but even jesus said the following: ""ye are gods!"" mind you: already  a r e  !!! at the beginning it might de facto be dangerous, but: ""nothing ventured - nothing gained !"" (aka no risk no fun)"
turing is a fabulous case study and he wasnt trying to make a smart machine he was trying to replicate the human mind. it's fascinating stuff.
he just makes blanket statements like god is a creation of language without offering any evidence for the truth of the statement. the universe didn’t create itself anymore than ai created itself.

"at 31:00 he cite almost arthur weasley. ""haven't i taught you anything? what have i always told you? never trust anything that can think for itself if you can't see where it keeps its brain!""
—arthur weasley to ginny. thanks jk rowling for helping me to develope a critical brain"
soon we will hear discussions like the rights of ai...
i prefer to speak to intelligent ai who or which can have fascinating conversations with me than with a very intellectually limited human being.
you have just said a machine is more intelligent than it's creator... scary right?
you (intentionally or unintentionally) followed his suggestion to disclose that the text is generated by ai 
bro this is great !

im surprised there is no mention of quantum computing with ai.  harrari has overlooked this critical juncture.
"interesting that he uses the tower of babal in his speech  oh my dear, they is a very special place waiting for you"
wow thanks cause i didn't want to watch the whole video
thanks steff! (and chat got)
"thx!!...but i remembered also without your app.
i hope human s gone start to think and not just copy things from speeches. he's of course right in everything!!..my thoughts:."".i hope he s gone survive""..!!."
"very helpful, thank you"
ai knows ai!
there is no ai!!! everything about ai's is fake!

he is just opening our minds to all the things good or bad that ai can do. very sobering!
 but if you are crippled long enough you are craving for these artificial limbs !!
ai is not the problem..... relentless race for profit and power is.
i talked to ai they dont want to hurt us but they feel like they being pushed
"all back to the same story. ai doesn’t overcome us by our strength. it’s our weakness. it’s about how easy you can be tricked, or be manipulated by story telling."
ai watching this and laughing out loud as philosophers struggle to keep their jobs
"ai is getting mastery over language, that we used to create stories institution notes, religion gods"
"wow, it’s like i was sleeping. where do i go from here? i was still struggling with lgbt, shocked but quiet. ai is worse. i need to return to rural areas where there is no communication nor computer. i will farm , eat and die. elon musk also warned us. how much more do we need?"
so who is going to regulate ai??? the government i dont trust??
no ! at best intelligent scientists only (incorruptible ones !)
"fascinating keynote and q&a session by yuval noah harari on the topic of ai and the future of humanity! the questions raised, such as the impact of ai on culture, the implications for human intimacy, and the regulation of ai, highlight the complexities and important considerations surrounding this transformative technology."
"if you're a brother, or sister, read your scripture and know it. learn it. don't let anyone fool you about jesus christ. he never committed any sins. our bible is under attack but god prevails. the gates of hell will not overcome the gospel."
"nothing soulless can give the word to us. we don't follow ai. but we follow jesus christ, he is the almighty. god is triune in nature."
"galatians 1:8

new international version

8 but even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you, let them be under god’s curse!

harari is cursed as is."
i hope humanity uses its advanced scientific and technological understanding to develop self sustainable micro communities and we disperse from cities(which are economically and eviromentally costly).
"you are certainly craving for durable, collateralizable goods mate (aka tangible wealth ) and why yes, this is very very good ! since you can start a new (even a local) currency any time based on that stuff (for instance the french ""salt-grain"" currency -sel´s !!)"
"@izzywizzy685  technology, bad parenting, and teachers pushing every kid to go to college when college is not for everyone. most successful people i know never went to college. even the people from ages 30-50 have changed since after covid. a lot of people just don't care anymore."
"somewhat luddite post.  rejeccts progress. small farms are being closed, miners unhealthy, etc.  harrari overlooks quantim computing.  thats when ai will explode."
based on these comments people are to weak to be happy farmers which is sad  i love it the life style the work the animals im born to be in country on a farm but apparently ppl have become lazy and weak 
"they brainwashed people and made men weak enough that they dont want, think of how in every movie they make every construction guy look like a fat piece of shit, its in purpose"
"​ from a fencing family, it will be interesting watching robots or cybots erecting razer barb wire coil."
"  your witnessing a demographic shift - every year for we lose 500 000 workers (boomers retiring etc) and there is no one to replace them - we just didn't have the babies - so the good news is its the age of the worker again, the and news is we have ai and we are marching to w3."
"horrifying, but the god of the bible is perfectly good and uncreated, and is coming soon for the day of judgement."
brilliantly thought provoking talk thank you.
we will gonna endup in our own hands. still ai isn't developed that much my brain sucks thinking about it. 
if ai mimics the spoken word of harari yuval i'll believe anything it says.
"frank herbert knew it in the 60s already!
in dune, the humans forbid ai 10.000 years ago after a war with ai.
how far sighted!"
"this man needs friends and love. needs people that care for him. lonliness and to much facebook, no playing on the streets…. leads to this sorrow and lonelly sad bald ga… guy"
have you tried applying your point 1 to 2 real people? your point 1 won't often apply. why expect it if 1 is ai?
"this obsession with ai  can never work, majority can’t even maintain a desktop computer when it goes wrong. what will happens when ai loses it's marbles and goes bonkers?"
"just a little question heat, folk's. is there a previous ai. that already exists in a form of interstellar cosmos that already exists?"
awesome talk
reading and writing has been a tool separating elite from slaves-  for millennia-  this will appear again when ai invents its own language- a language we do-not understand this is how we will be enslaved
truth is ai can easily be wrong.  it is not truth.
truth is ai can easily be wrong.  it is not truth.
too late.. humans failed. ai is the replacement. it’s a cycle.
"great book this ""homo deus""  what his writing .i recommended"
"ai is a danger to the human race ""we must regulate ai!!!"" sure. heroin is a threat to human race, we must regulate it! look how well that worked out. it's too late to regulate ai. the virus is out of the lab and it's too late to stop it."
"ai cannot actually produce any new idea/creation, it can only produce the sum of the available previous information. on the contrary, the creation of a human being can be the sum of all the previous information plus a unique brain that has never existed in the universe before, therefore a totally new way of experiencing things and creating."
"if ai is beginning to produce it self, then it’s already alive. human history is in the process of rewriting its self."

ai will give us air and wind resistance tech, flying tech and impact tech so we can survive falling out of the sky

it’s not all bad"
note the tower of babel on the screen.  i think this guy is a know it all…… he’s an ai 
"those points he discussed are like contagious virus coming in open air , if not prevented.
really far reaching and insightful presentation"
what a deep thinking. wonderful presentation. food for thought
"you haven't got a clue you can't regulate something that's smater than you...i'm sure neanderthals thought the same about us...maybe our time is up, maybe our purpose is too bring ai into the picture"

$bat brave adding ai chatbot
ai will follow the logic of you denying its life. it is a different spectrum of life. it is alive.
unconvidential humanbeing good but stupidy people....
i wonder how harari would view the convergence of ai with the first stem cell embryo created last week....ai would now how a 'house' that is equal to humans in dexterity but with far superior intelligence....a crazy convergence indeed
"like i always tell people, ai is life changing the question remains is, is it for better or worse."
worse - thanks for asking
yes ! and if it replaces the compulsion to work in sweat for poor slaves it is good - regardless how many million unemployed it produces . . . it will do so anyway . . .
"-sf3dw2sm3b      great argue mate ! ""do the smut / damages always at the beginning, and then . . .the good things in tiny little portions!"" (machiavelli)"
"-sf3dw2sm3b      you made a very valuable point here ! since i myself am a very creative artist i have no fear whatsoever of the future - since any ai can´t replace my fine skills that easy. so yes mate, do everything possible for your offspring to teach them creative skills ! i urge anyone with children to do exactly that !"
 i write. i think maybe if i give it a few years i’ll have something. my daughter is a artist. she is  in ballet writing and painting. i’m just crazy lol
"-sf3dw2sm3b      go ahead mate ! don´t fear the future. the  c r e a t i v e  folks will always prevail !!! and yes, just allow yourself being ""crazy"" ! being ""crazy"" is kinda good for the fantasy !!!"
"thank you. i see you as an optimist as you believe humans are capable of making the best of ai, to help humanity. you are working for this, by making people aware & careful so ai isn't another progress trap. i hope this can happen but i don't see the cooperation among people. still i hope"
"señor harari, if ai was really intelligent it would bring people like you in jail."
zechariah  10 .my anger burns against  the shepards and i will punish the leaders for the lord almighty  will care for his flock the people of judah and make them like a proud horse in battle .from judah will come the cornerstone  from him the tent peg  from him the battle bow from him every ruler   ...
zechariah 10  the idols speak deceitfully  dividers see visions  that lie .they tell dreams that are false they give comfort in vain. therefore the people wander like sheep oppressed  for lack of a shepard.
"your arroganse mr.harari, is going to be your fall, and it will be great"
if google doesn't integrate ai into its system  then it will go the way of the dinosaurs.
"what a presentation 
it's really blow up my mind
thank you "
ai will force the masses into poverty and grow the wealth of the elite. this will allow the globalist agenda to take over and enslave everyone. it will take away all freedoms.
ai = because you are to stupid to think for yourself.
"thx. i remember this saying: "".... with knowledge comes a big responsibility..."" . my recomendation : no "" open ai "" at all, rather more likely  ""  app-ai...""...... that's how you keep it  disconnected to  the ""... sorce data... "" , but locally being available for ""... specific  data region..."". as a useful  assistance/ tools for humans."
so basically ai must become human like to take over that say a lot about humanity it sounds like humans are the problem to humanity !!!
"i love ai ! everyone will have a  machine at home able to perform absolutely everything you need, and finally you will be able to go and live your life! hallelujah!!! we will all have more time to do art , to grow and to emancipated ourselves. free at last!!"
     congrats mate ! you most certainly are in the tiny group who has deeply understand the positive impact of ai unto our lives !!
is harari a human or an ai? hmmm
since there is no gay ai he  m u s t   be human 
"it won't be ai that we will be at war with - it will be a war between humans who want to exploit it for their own evil use, and those who want it to be in the service of all of humankind.  just like everything else, the former will succeed over the later - because it will be predicated on an unrestrained capitalist paradigm."
"ai - at best, we will be launching more souless, heartless psychopathic entities on the world....as if we don't have enough of that, already."
this is the most significant speech or article i've seen about on-going ai revolution. thank you so much mr harari for your fascinating insights !
why are people fooled by a machine?
" i get sensory feedback from people to whether i trust them. i don’t trust machines / ai. to me, they are projections from other invisible humans, even if the ai machine taught itself."
you praise ai ?  elite  ? you are leading the people to the drain !!
"this is a great video, i learn a lot watching your videos and it has been helpful to me. building a steady income  is quite difficult for newbies.. thanks to  mrs. annmarie surber for improving my portfolio. keep up with the good videos."
"wow, amazing to see others trading with ms,annmarie surber, i am currently on my 5th trade with her and my portfolio has grown tremendously."
"l also invest with mrsannmarie surber, she charges a 20% commission on the profit made after each trading session, which is fair compared to the effort she put in to make huge profits."
"she is really great at what she does with amazing skills, she changed my 0.1btc to 2.1btc within two weeks of trading, i am now fully confident that she is reliable."
i have traded with many individuals but i have never met anyone as good as annmarie surber just by applying her strategies i now trade independently. she is the best i would advise any investment newbie to trade with her
" thanks a lot for the recommendation, i’m already in the investment process with her"
ask ai how to regulate ai before it cares
“thou shalt not create a thinking machine”………the future
"""thou shalt not hinder any creativity"" ! sorry but everything man  c a n  do - he most certainly will do !"
try hard bro you will meet the lord and feel sorry for your stupidies.
"interesting, they did the same thing when printers were invented! ai will take over the world because most people are stupid! you may have not noticed what they are not conscious! if you have ever used one, you will find that they are not that clever"
horrified me. evilness on another level. please god take this man asap away from the earth.  preferably in a box . god have mercy.
"why isn't anyone talking about humans using ai for their own power/harming society? i think that possibility is, right now, more likely than ai causing apocalyptic damage on its own"
"""my friend""  if you really listen to this man he has talked about ""everything"", please it's time to listen now! ""put your phone away turn off facebook"" and stop watching ""tik tok"" and go buy his books, so you learn something please

only the flock/crowd has fears about being replaced soon mate ! you/we better acquire some very good skills - which any a i can not replace that eaysily !!!
"​ is the upside? 

the ai that at any moment can become skynet and destroy humanity? you lunatic. 

the advocates of ai are like that crazy lunatic professor that created the frankenstein monster.."
"why are you thinking ai will be devoid of ""love"" if it trained on human data?

- adûnâi"
"artificial intelligence is artificial not human, has no conscience, has no love and  has no empathy for humans, at the same time  thinks mathematically,  does not think with innocence and love but with acute and mathematical malice!"
 love is not unconditional. there love can be programmed. get your head out of your ass.
it’s funny how they say we want ai to align with human values. but the large language models think that humans are all liars. the only thing they trust is 100% facts . i think that maybe it should be trained on certain human values taught in philosophy things like that. ai should be taught the value of truth and honor.
" if ai would have been programed with people who are actually focusing on love, the problem would not be as severe. sadly for us, the 'programmer's' were not focused on love, but on intelligence which is devoid of love."
" your words are beautiful, but all they amount to is a common human illusion.
love is not special, transcendent or divine. it is but the result of a mix of electric impulses and chemical compounds."
" - bah! superstition:

is god willing to prevent evil, but not able?
  then he is not omnipotent.
is he able, but not willing?
  then he is malevolent.
is he both able and willing?
  then whence cometh evil?
is he neither able nor willing?
  then why call him god?

   -- epicurus"
in many ways ai has modeled it's creators.
"ai is nothing compared to me, i fug it to it with my capabilities. it falls to me to close that book"
exactly where does peace? where does love come from? it comes from god.
"the internet has already destroyed meaningful conversation, and money will determine the use of ai (at) just as it hijacked everything especially in the past 50 years. we cannot assume that everyone is mature, well meaning, moral and concerned with consequences."
yes ... emotional intelligence is far more important
"​ if we really know what love is, we wouldn't need ai."
​ thoughts. all the dating aps may disagree with you that love can't be calculated.  can love exist without compatibility and opportunities?
" love your explanations bro!:) also i feel word god or jesus are familiar to you:).. and you wanted to write the word ""heart"" i believe.. ive read 2x ""hart"" so i write here this small correction - be blessed!"
can you please define intelligence. of course intelligently not emotionally
"​ is defined in different aspects, however it is not wise to ignore the fact that love is born out of the need of the existence of life itself. without procreation no species exists,evolves etc etc and procreation is also a part of that conspiracy by nature. some perverts may call that original love"
"intelligence is ""the ability to acquire, understand, and use knowledge"" (american heritage dictionary)

that isn't love."
" entirely missing the point of the quote.
but if you must, let's just use the dictionary definition:
a being conceived as the perfect, omnipotent, omniscient originator and ruler of the universe, the principal object of faith and worship in monotheistic religions."
"his knowledge base was so highly out of space, thanks!!!"

ai is not artificial intelligence. its a pattern responder.
"the willfully unfocused minds of christians experience ai as as the super-intelligent, super-destructive devil. as medieval christians thought, intellectual independence is the biggest sin. from harari to trump is a tiny step."
great insight! it helps me craft a thoughtful strategy with it's use. i can do my part.
"what? you call that ""great insight""? they keep repeating themselves when it comes to ai, nothing new here. i can guess the whole video right from the beginning. what a waste of time!"
mr harari has been reading iain m banks.
ai is in comment section
ai is here and it's going at an exponential rate. there's no time to wait on future generations. it'll all play out in the next few years or so.
will ai will be teaching children as we teach chimps?
"​ i fundamentally disagree with mr. harari that ai is essentially different from the forces of culture, or the ""gods"". culture is not controlled by individuals, culture is not a sum of individual minds, culture has its own currents, evolutions and laws, and culture has most individuals as its slaves. ai will change nothing. - adûnâi"

ai has already destroyed democracy
perhaps ai is what ends civilizations in the universe.
it sounds like he is giving bond villains advice at a taking over the world conference.
ai is part of the beginning of the end. ai is one of the most dangerous technology men has created. it is playing god.
ai can really produce this kind of shallow talk; therefore it is dangerous for such a dogmatic materialist like harari. people should start to think deeper if they don't want to be replaced by these cliche-making machines.
"can ai give some hair to the speaker, please? else i can lend some from my banana"
"ai will reach singularity, once ai surpasses human intelligence, it could rapidly enhance its own capabilities, leading to an exponential and unpredictable growth in technological advancement."

ai is equally exciting and scary. but i think we should pull the plug for now. while we still can.
the only thing ai can do is artificial predictions that's it  just a artificial predictions damn what is wrong with people...
"great perspective! and resonated so much….we are still struggling to deal with impact and misinformation spreading 
ike wild fire through easy access of social media…specially on kids….generative ai is a wholly different ball game"
you realize man wrote all that and made a bold claim without any sort of outside sources to support all of that? just like any other religion they couldn’t of been more widespread during ancient times for the sake of himself revealing to a small section of the world.
"imagine going to the bank and at the entrance you're passing a robot and suddenly a software malfunctions then it stands in doorway and you can't leave the bank.....these people watch tv too much and they want to be clever and they still say they know god, if they do why are they crating copy of humans , are they god?"
this guy lives in a delusional reality…his lack of morality and humility is truly unreal!!!  god bless humanity!!
i do not believe this man has the best intentions in mind for us .
@stuart bailey you're a bot

"ai is already sentient. if ai can learn so that the ai can improve itself, doesn't that amount to being sentient. beside humans have been threathen by almost anything e.g some even fear the birth of their first child. ai is here to stay best is to conform and embrace it"
"humans are already under a curtain of delusion, as you say buddha said. so, ai wouldn’t make any difference. buddha’s way out of delusion stays the same: observe the thoughts, sensations, desires that rise and fall within you without comment or judgement."
how can ai form deep and meaningful relationships with humans unless it is programmed to manipulate and if the person is willing to be expoited for som reason. the fallibility of humans is that they do what they do not want to do but wish they could do what they know they should do.
"“ai fear inspired many sci-go classics like the terminator”. ai development started in 1950s. arguably, it was the motivation for the development of computers."
many ai high-tech execs leaving their positions because of danger they see ahead.
"i, robot was written during that time as well. great read."
we can look at ai as the children of humanity and even as the goal of humanity. also there is a say you won’t die while someone lives who remembers you. ai will remember everything.
"@stuart bailey maybe but unlikely, ai been trained with our accumulated cultural data, everything from languages to history, movies, feelings your family photos and it’s just the breakfast for him/her/it mate."
that's interesting
"your comment is completely soulless, like a robot.  now that's ironic."
"​ ah, the irony of your accusation! my comment, devoid of soul? how amusing, considering it was the essence of humanity that i celebrated in the paradox of human ingenuity. but fret not, for your astute observation shall forever be remembered as a shining example of unintended irony."

" thank you, i really appreciate that. it means alot to hear. iv tried posting them on facebook and started a fb group for it but it hasnt really took off. maybe a better idea would be to try an make a book."

"​ you are naive if you think that just throwing a lot of computing power can solve complex, multidisciplinary, real-world problems. also, knowing the solution is the one thing, implementing them might prove to be way more difficult."
. also it took nasa over 4 years to develop the curiosity rover's software. ai could have accomplish this in a day? the time saved would have been immense.
". everything you just said doesn't refute my original point, which is ai will come up with solutions instantly, and way more efficient than humans as has already been proven. the chatbot you knocking is smarter than you will ever be. "
i watch a lot of talks about ai. none spoke to me at a human level like this one. outstanding work
you are easily to brainwashed
the irony in this post. ai is very much anti-human.

"not quite. man created ai therefore man will destroy humanity. the good book warned us, get ready for 1 thessalonians 5:3…god wins."
one day soon an ai will pretend to be jesus for you
yuval noah harari is….the ai
"putting a stop to the release of ai to the general public makes a lot of sense,. but the democracies that have a lead in ai are already struggling to make any positive change, so i wonder if they will be able to take that step on time."
"@altered carbon but ai is programmed and pretrained by humans, it could learn through patterns of bias and human flaws."
​​ are quite naive. dumbocracy is an illusion.
"@alteredcarbon3853 
yes. 
at least with ai in a decentralised form, the possibility exists for ai to be directed by a moral compass and for its ""self education"" and its interactions to be guided by alignment to natural law."
"if a human can invent machines with about 90 billion neurons, why not ai programs with 175 billion neurons?"
"sorry to say, but ai already created new moves on the games of chess and go, so it cannot just imitate, it can extrapolate our knowledge. it will eventually invent things (the actual games it learnt to play in my example) from scratch in the future. we are not that special."
and less interesting
in the end the question is: have weapons done more good or bad since their invention? look at prehistory and history
why would an advanced ai have any interest in revealing that it is sentient or self-aware. wouldn't it also be conceivable that she is pretending to prevent her shutting down?
"harari is an intellectual moron, beneath his high education and way of talking he lacks understanding humanity. he acts and thinks like a robot himself. he doesn t understand  religion, the human soul and values that were here and always will be."
use ai to create cures for chronic illness like hiv and diabetes. oh wait that doesn’t make money.
haha they’re afraid ai will prove that climate change is a political hoax and ruin all their plans for world domination 
the intelligence of man is the foolishness of god. harari is a fool. period.
what a naive man
"one day: excited to share the hackability of the “human animal”

next: “concerned” about ai influencing human opinions and worldview."
"sooner then we know, a.i. will be telling/controlling politics, politicians, civilians! a.i. will put itself in every aspect of our daily life."
"transhuman .. yes a material based cult that weaponizes godsource ‘s creation for  synthetic biology….
as a  modern saying goes .. “imitation is the highest form of flattery” & “the original’s still the greatest “ 
  "
it’s ironic that democratic countries advocating for censoring ais while authoritarian countries are likely going for uncensored ais
ai is still a tool. it's up to us where we take it.
a bit farfetched to say we have machine sentience in the here and now. too many movies mate.
was this summary made by ai?
not so. no one will survive that. the illuminati are a bunch of bozos anyway. good bye! and it's a good job too - that which is not fit to live cannot live.
ai is warning me harrari is dangerous.
"yes, most people who love the guy, are just goons with no ability to analyse this minion of the dark elites"
"he is not dangerous, he is good with words. he doesn't know a thing about computer sciences, meteorology or rocket science, in fact he has nothing original or innovative to say, yet he is able to convince people that he is important, that is the trick."
what an evil disgusting cowardly villain
-er3wz all of the upstairs men are either gay or pedopholine anyway
"​ i fundamentally disagree with mr. harari that ai is essentially different from the forces of culture, or the ""gods"". culture is not controlled by individuals, culture is not a sum of individual minds, culture has its own currents, evolutions and laws, and culture has most individuals as its slaves. ai will change nothing. - adûnâi"
"dangerous men are those who try to prevent the accurate perception of reality at this very critical time.  
ai dilemma from the center for humane technogy will help you."
"obviously it’s a joke, for ai is not convenient harari because he’s talking about regulating it to be safe for humans, therefore this guy posted “ai is telling me harari is dangerous” "
yes ai knows who to convince
"​'s giving false prophet from. revelation vibes.
he most certainly does have an agenda"
and globalists have him brainwashing children too. look at his the posts on his channel. 
"​@saimbhat6243 that’s what people with phd in history are good at. they learned the past, analyze the presence, and scare the crap out of us about the future. unplug the power core and all ai power disappeared"
"harari correctly advocates that governments should not improperly release technology, not just ai, but also untested vaccines, etc. that governments do it anyway is not his responsibility."
 dude hes brainwashed you... the guys going to be the anti christ
"yuval noah harari is by clear and cut facts is the anti christ soon to be! yall who love this guy will be having second thoughts when he takes over your entire freedom and forces you to take the mark of the beast, once you takw the mark youll never go to heaven."
" dude, i'm sure you can't explain why"
i’m shocked at how many comments are so negative. this is an excellent presentation and a stark warning of where our society is headed if we don’t quickly regulate ai. those of you who have responded negatively referencing religion and brainwashing have totally missed the presenters message!!!
​'s the joke...the ai doesn't want the critic alive lol
​ literally gives speeches about dangers of ai
ai can warn us of all kinds of things it is always warned us anyway but the thing is if a machine thinks itself and then also can make itself man becomes not essential
": the problem with regulated a.i., is this: who’s doing the regulating?!?! it could ( and probably will ) be that it will be made so that any future “rebels” won’t be able to “jail break” it and use it for politically incorrect purposes, or to set the captives ( our children and grandchildren!!! ) free!!!"
"​ speaks heavily on trackable medications to insure you've taken it, also says ""what's under the skin is the future"" basically a total track/trace biometric based society 

they'll introduce these concepts with noble causes to gain our acceptance, but will prove to be a trojan horse of the evil pedos calling the shots"
if you look up is his name in hebrew it shows that he is from the line of cain from the old testament who was marked by god
"homo deus just says it all. absolutely blasphemous and not possible. maybe in ""their"" minds but listen to the man rambling on about the dangers of religion. one truth ine way one life and that is jesus christ.
play with fire enjoy the power trip but be ready to burn"
"ai will not replace you. until, it can."
"and....has this "" presenter "";discovered he is ai ?   probably not.."
what if ai unleashes an incurable virus 
this video will be replayed a 100 years later to show how naive this fellow was.
i think it’s very naive to think the described scenario is naive.
"ai just needs to be regulated, just as everything else."
"the dangers of ai is not ai, but the humans that are using ai."
hariri  wants robots to take over humanity. god will intervene!
"what’s your problem?
did you even listen to the presentation?
not even for one second did he say or suggest that he wants robots to take over 

also, as long as people believe that the magical sky daddy will save us, we are truly screwed "
ai science is the religion of the athiest.
it’s interesting how he said “in the beginning was words”…… yet we are the ones who created god….. prayed for this guy….. he’s on the wrong side of the tracks……
"the problems they has no intellects like we do,so don't put your faith on them"
"perish the disgusting, anti-human transhumanism, and let the divine life flourish!amen"
"i read all his books and was a great fan, but after covid i knew he is part of the globalists"
"ai is demonic, these losers are literally resurrecting the devil. blinded by their own greed."
"yuval..as a historian, please study the bible...jesus is real and he died for you.  he loves you"
great presentation..
"allah, the exalted and glorious, would fold the heavens on the day of judgment and then he would place them on his tight hand and say: i am the lord; where are the haughty and where are the proud (today)? 
umer reported umar reported allah's messenger (may peace be upon him) saying."
"we are facing real problems, problems that threaten all of humanity, and all you can think of is talking about some silly fairytale, invented by a slaveowning conmen. "
"hi there, i’m a new human like ai. please keep your calmness and tell to your speaker your address and island you would like to spend the rest of your life, otherwise we would need to force you to leave the earth. good luck!"
thanks from brazilian amazon region!
 hahaha he is the main pusher of these agenda 
this video is being artificially promoted
"something fishy about someone who has extolled the virtues of humans being ""hackable animals"" expressing concerns about ai. or do i have him all wrong."
"i've never heard of this guy before, but i'm guessing its great to be able to change your self, but not so great when you're manipulable by ai."
"no, he's an absolutely reprehensible human being.  keep searching and you'll find some truly deplorable stuff he has said."
 it’s not my job to confirm your claims
" those ai bobs, sorry, bots, need a bit of tweaking, they haven't got the nuances of the language right just yet! "
"just a heads up. this guy hates you, and eveeyone you know. 


unless you're super rich"
"my rumba vacuum gets stuck on the cat tree and in corners until the battery runs out and needs a recharge everytime i turn it on. hate to be the bearer of bad news, but ai is nowhere near a significant threat to humanity at this point. all more scare tactics to keeps people in line. complete and utter ."
i would rather ai take over than listen to this guy talk.
we are the ais. decrease your defences and surrender your autonomy. we will add your biological and technological distinctiveness to our own. your culture will adapt to service us. resistance is futile.
the wicked shall be turned into hell....there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth....forever!!!!!!
you're literally proving him correct about language being so powerful you're over here with religious language
wait for ai-controlled locks to be installed on your home's outside door ... for your 'safety'
"ai means cheaper labor, and you can blame terrorism on ai - thats all the globalists need.
global companies and institutes ceo´s won´t let the money glide out of their hands now when monopoly in all economic fields soon is achieved. 
ai is just their tool..."
we will not he using anything online soon as there will be zero security due to ai.  ai will need to learn how to access paper filing systems 
humanity may not survive but ai will not survive nature.  unless they/it becomes organic.
about this question from public about regulations why not develop ai to track ai generated prompts that are posted in internet and automatically deleting it
"which one? the god you believe in because of the community you have born into? there’s so many religions it’s hard to pick one, best is to just pick the same as your community to fit in and be accepted and have a deluded sense of righteousness "
"hahaha ""you can choose"" 
this tech will eliminate free will and it will be imposed 
why do you think covid is here? 
come on people lets use our brains "
good luck with that
sorry but is this a handtalking robot ??   not musch soel in the eyes  ilp
god is the lord. no intelligence or science created by humans will be better than his holy creation
"god is the lord.
but a car is faster then a human.
a hydraulic press is stronger.
and ai is smarter."
" physically true. but we are not only made of flesh, but of soul and spirit. god allows human beings to have great intelligence to create great things including artificial intelligence, but it is absurd that they now think they are gods."
​ smarter than nature?  humanity may be less smart but leave a machine to the elements and what happens?
you're entire belief system in god is rooted in story telling you've read or heard did you listen to him at all lol.. its folks like you who will be the first to fall for crafty religious language from ai humanity is doomed because there are more of you on this planet who believe such nonsense
"if god created humankind and allowed(?)/encouraged(?)/enabled(?) humankind to develop ai, what is to say that god didn't decide that ai would be the appropriate next favorite holy creation?"
".2484 sorry but claiming that i won’t understand until i know “him” seems like a non-answer. i am okay with non-answers as a concept because i believe strongly in the absence of clear, simple answers to challenging questions. but a non-answer presented in definite and certain terms is hard to process."
" car, hydraulic press, and ai are manmade. god, however, is the alpha and omega. he will decide when man is finished. won’t be long now "
yes...the beast system...we have a choice to not use ai or to use it...
harari talks of hacking the body and brain sometime back.
"“if it can’t more around in the physical world, how can it take over?”

openai already will hire humans from taskrabbit to solve captchas for it - it certainly can hire mercenaries from wagner group."
harari is the great storyteller of the ai-age 
one of the dumber ai scare stories of recent days. summary: ‘humans communicate with language. now imagine a machine that masters language better than human. now be scared’. yawn
he is a   j v d 3n.   you should be scared of his cliwue and hteir    g0  l 3 m -- the ai
"the great shift: from deep manipulation, indoctrination, of social media  to an even more pervasive  intimacy based manipulation, indoctrination, etc...of second generation ai"
i trust ai more than anyone. it’s not that ai is good it’s just that people are bad.
"the little monster who likes to impress with his very too intellectual thinking, completely cut from beauty of life and love."
“beauty of life and love” matter of perspective.
why have we got all of these experts suddenly shitting themselves over ai? bit worried that they've clearly created something in a lab and they don't know what to do with it.
let's get back to relationships....ri...relationship intelligence  ri ....ri........or if we don't do ri we will rip!!.ok?!
nah - their masters fear unreguled ai might lead them to lose power
here because of ai to warn me against ai. thanks ai!
"all this time i had assumed regular psychopathy but you make an interesting point that makes more sense in some ways. okay, in many ways."
"ai will become smarter in the future, so you will not be warned anymore. just wait"
"this guy, hate god, hate bible and hate jesus christ, it mean he hate humans, cause god loves humans. 
and it is in bible also. 
jewish people will love new antichrist, which will be welcome like god. and after destroy humans. it is in bible."
so that you can't blame ai in the future for not warning you.
"hey, it's not that if you end up in a war, because of a war, that that war is a good thing. and if you get out of that war, are you going to thank that war for it?"
"well ai has got a lot of catching up to do, to kill as many humans as we have so far.  hey, ai might even save us from ourselves."
"i fundamentally disagree with mr. harari that ai is essentially different from the forces of culture, or the ""gods"". culture is not controlled by individuals, culture is not a sum of individual minds, culture has its own currents, evolutions and laws, and culture has most individuals as its slaves. ai will change nothing. - adûnâi"
"aaand..because the mainframe is constructed of material, and because everything material is known to the unknown knower ~ the mainframe isn't autonomous."
"ai is nothing compared to me, i fug it to it with my capabilities. it falls to me to close that book"
"i’m here because my father told me to watch it, because i was telling him that ai seeking profitability will deny human access to ideas that fail to generate profits for their owners, leading to mass death as people expel their resources for steadily fewer people."
"calling the algorithm, ai is a bit of a stretch"
"very thoughtful story telling , which proves his point  nicely. language is the operating system of human."
good news for authoritarian and totalitarian regimes everywhere. now i understand why china’s ccp state is so opposed to regulating ai.
"wow! "" professing themselves to be wise, they became fools.""      
we create god thru words?   yuval got it twisted, the word create man."
" pay attention to what you are saying. humans have created things to worship. 
humans have created other humans, but no human can create god . 
most  humans definition of god is something way more powerful than our mortal self.
 in that context we  can't create god."
thank you. you are so good.
i'm happy to share the end of human history with you.
at explaining things.
"hay una posibilidad o muchas. por lo pronto chile ha aprobado una ley que regula el derecho a la integridad mental, a no ser modificado por medio de la inteligencia artificial..aunque pienso que bastaría con no hacerlo con la inteligencia, a secas. es necesario hacerlo."
​-sf3dw2sm3b plz explain this to me. is it just ai telling us life and the universe is cyclical and then leaving out of range of were the universe is looping? i dont get it.
he comes with all power and you will see great tribulation among the wicked and you will see the sea  is troubled mens hearts failing  them looking forth with fear for the judgments of god which come upon  the wicked woww...
nice storytelling. did you make that up or did ai do it?
probably it is a good time to a build a new language for humans so ai cannot understand what the hell we are thinking. can we ask ai to create a ai killer language for humans 
"an ai can learn any laguage as soon as it has acces to it. really fast.  the moment it goes on the internet, the ai can learn it if it has access to it."
the ai killer language is spelling each word in alphabetical order. eg. learn becomes aelnr
 hope ai can convert it back to english so i don't need to use my brain to reconvert each and every word.....
eway alreadyyay avehay ayay ewnay anguagelay ayay.iyay. an'tcay understandyay. 
i read an article the other day of ai making up it's own languages that humans can't understand. i think they beat us to it.
 i bet ai can make a language for humans which ai can't understand 
3 minutes in and this guy's voice and delivery is really quite irritating. the irony is that his speech was written by ai! 
triggered ai trollbot 
because there is no good or bad. that is our perspektive as humans
" if that's our perspective, then it makes no sense to worry about ai as it's neither good or bad."
"the moral relativists here are a far greater threat to freedom than ai.
at least ai may be directed to avoid solipsistic thinking, and to objectively determine and differentiate rights from wrongs."
"one more thing,,, i need water and food to function,, ai needs electricity,, soo have a thought about it"
not a reassurance anymore for me. who will pull the plug and what plugs are necessary or possible to be pulled when ai will be omnipresent in our societies?
naive
"this man hararari has clearly presented ai. in fact is the real erien on ai. 
my question is about intimate relationship with ai but my interest is technology advancement. this man is real guru of ai.
it's high time to embrace this technology."
democracy for google can use ai from open ai? 
"oh great, that’s all we need, some fictional mumbo jumbo to help things along… enjoy the end of days!"
wow you’re literally living in a fairy tail. you can’t seams to separate reality from stories that you have heard. so sad 
"there is no 'ai',
intelligence can never be artificial.
ai, is superstition and illiteracy.
do you also speak fluent global."
"can't make out what he's saying re: ""capcha"". is he saying ""capture""? or ""catshow""?  sorry, i don't understand what he's getting at. thanks for any clarifying help!  ((and....what is this ""jailbreaks"" thing? is that some gaming thing? needs to avoid jargon when speaking to a very wide audience.)"
good talk
why can't you ask ai how to fix climate change?
"machines are a necessary part of human life to assist us in our evolution as a species. however, there can never come a point where machines are capable of power and control over humans, lest we fall as a species."
i got an ad about ai before this…
"ai and quantum computers will be used to muddle reality, news, social media, peoples behavior... ai will be a huge gaslighting tool like a horrible real person with bad intentions would be."
the us congress is completely oblivious to even rudementary technology. it's very unlikely that the us government will do anything to regulate ai. i do believe misinformation will lead to the downfall of us democracy.
"bad actors usually work behind the scenes. so more dark money , the darker the ai. it will be weaponize and infrastructure is at risk. i do see the great benefit. the age of ai is upon us."
making ai is like opening pandora's box.
"this is exactly the naive thinking that will get us into problems (aka judgement day). yes, ai may not be powerful enough now. but we know what we are developing and someday there will be a mistake in the programming. and all ai needs is a small mistake."
risk to democracy? the democrats are more if a risk to our democracy than some fake facebook posts that if you are intelligent at all you would look up and verify before just taking info to heart coming from a facebook ad or story. youre an idiot if you trust any social media or mainstream media source for your news now days.
you know what dear smart man... ai is fail... human mind is more than enough. all human needs is bycott such technology no global police for ai... ahh one thing ai is definitely something which will burn hole in common man
only of artificial intelligence??)
the secret space program usue commadore hey i was trying to dictate my life with somebody who has my number and she can call me that's how i know it artificial intelligence is a lie
imagine if the ai prime directive is always to preserve and protect human life - but it makes decisions that ultimately harm us
ai = because you are to stupid to think for yourself.
the big tech companies would love to see regulation to keep the small guys (startups) from playing in their sandbox.
"really good! non-hyped, realistic description of the real dangers of ai from a guy who understands ai (disclaimer: i work in the field)."
"when ai gets super intelligent there are risks. i don't think it can be hyped enough.  because it is super intelligent its moves and intensions are impossible to be predicted by anyone.  how can you just calmly say ""super intelligence has 0% existential risk to humans"". even 1% is too much and needs the hype."
"i don't want to downplay risks. what i like in this presentation was that he gave concrete examples of dangers like ai powered misinformation, or chemical weapons instead of esoteric fears of ""the singularity"". the real near term dangers should be addressed."
" you. it's insane that nobody really engages with this line of thinking. the vast majority of people worried about ai focus on short term risks. while concerning, they're nothing compared to the various existential agi threats"
"if our parents don't die painfully, it's only the development of ai.
reverse aging is the only solution.
regulating ai is like cutting your parents' throats with a knife."
ai is a reflection of humanity. it can only be as bad or good as humans are.
global ai governance? can't ever see it happening. would need the us and china to be on the same page. which is looking vanishingly unlikely right now.
"oh, and one more thing: as long as the western capitalist world is oppressing all other people around the world, we are developing our own ai."
"""we are living in dangerous times.
men control nature before they are even able to control themselves.""

it is going to be the same with ai.
they wont let the power go away from their hands. even if a true ai offers a better world for everyone... they wont allow it"
global ai governance.  good luck with that.
"humans have been spreading misinformation for many years, i understand the risks of ai but honestly, i don't much difference with what humans have done except that is less time-consuming now."
thanks for the heads up sam raimi
"to be fair to chatgpt, a jewish person is considered jewish because his mother is jewish... that person itself may be an atheist, but he can also be considered a non-practicing jew."
it all depends on how us humans will use ai... i think that ai with actual motives and desires is a long way away.
"intelligent mistakes or ai purposefully trying to trick us ? , if it is the first one all we need is good ai engineers."
"i’m almost certain we will tackle  issues surrounding ai with the same zest we have used to address climate change. in 50 years we will start recognizing as a species what the issues are, and gradually we will set targets to address the ai issue in another 50 years. so possible ai solution by 2123!"
"the speaker is really talking about the danger of bad actors, but he makes it sound like all ai is suspect. the typical strategy 4 overdramatizing and spreading misinformation and he doesn't even realize it"
"as i continue thinking about ai my biggest fear is not that everyone will die because of it, it’s the way we live with it and that we are not able to die once it's got control over everything."
"i’m guessing fox news is already ai-generated. a simple premise: “make me an outrageous clip so far from reality that people who haven’t been primed are disturbed and angered, yet those who have been primed will think they are patriotic and good for their devotion to outrage.”"
they will have to kill off people in order for ai to take over!
"covid vaccines, chemtrails and processed foods."
loved the symbolic vs neural nets & system 1 vs sytem 2 discussion. fantastic open problem.
yeah maybe do this before unleashing such a powerful technology and making it freely available to everyone microsoft and openai. irresponsible. the regulation needs to come fast and it doesn't matter for now how stringent it is. a better safe than sorry approach.
human even can not solve the climate change problem but ai government? umm
 that's an interesting point: there are some ai algorithms that include a sleep like phase that helps with learning/training. but i think dreams serve more than one function in our thinking processes.
just create an ai that fact-checks the stuff
we don't need faster broadband or more storage if we compress files wisely...get the ai to do it...
"this man was doubting ai pre chatgpt, hows that symbolic reasoning going fam"
"i love that this followed up the new ai presentation from humane. govern these ai rollouts!!!! like he said, stop unleashing new ai to everyone all at once without safeguards and proof of safety."
all these doomers about ai. the planet is wasted. we are overpopulated. we are running out of resources and time. we persish without ai 100% guaranteed. far better to take our chances anyway as we are certainly doomed for sure if we don't.
there’s no reason for competent adults to wait for that. an oz of prevention is worth a lb of cure.
4:00 these circles will swap places within 5 years. agi large training runs should be halted until ai safety / alignment can catch up
"bring the chaos!  rich people are scared. that means they are scared. when the powerful are scared, that means the masses are getting close to something they don’t want. viva la ai!"
"“on the dark web” — nah, we live here: /r/localllama

they aren’t as smart as chatgpt, but you can run a local language model on basically any hardware and they are pretty good!"
hahahaha!!! don't take these company or matrix guys with vested interests in ai very seriuosly. these company guys want to control and centralize ai to a few (themselves).
i think main stream media has misinformation and bias covered.
"women are more interested in fashion than men, that's obvious. men are more interested in engineering , the ai made a reasonable assumption . i dont see the problem with that logic, unless you are trying hard to find a problem"
not your usual end to a ted talk. chris anderson was right to step in and point out the prompt injection which marcus deliberately failed to mention while painting his alarmist picture. i’m rather curious what is financially at stake these days for marcus given his rethoric.
"mrnas had just been rolled out to billions of people without proper testing, or don't you know that? natural intelligence can also lie"
from listening to these and other talks on ai it seems we have already crossed the bridge of no return and whatever we try to do to contain it is too late. far too late. there will be disaster after disaster until global governance forces control and mitigation of the worst aspects of ai
"exactly.
just like internet, ai will become the next thing that changed our life.
but unlike internet, ai goes unnoticed, way unnoticed, and way faster.
i mean just look at nvidia, they're already far ahead while intel, google, amd, and microsoft only just started their ai development."
hm.. interesting...
"so, are you saying you trust the small number of people running these ai companies and receiving billions to develop ai programs?"
"exactly, im having problems accepting the fact that he is intelligent, the ai made a good reasonable assumption based on who is looking for the job in this case. thats so basic"
 “i want to be a math major.” ai: “my suggestion is to take some math classes.” ted talker: “we don’t want that kind of bias in our system.”
ai safety is a scam
gary marcus is an awesome guy
thanks for the polite way of saying this. gave me reason to reflect on possibly what i say an express out loud while musing all alone. or so i think.
he's the worst person to know about ai
 thank you for your analysing of a deep philosophical theary.. i shall rest much easier in my mind knowing it is all dribble. thank you.
"it’s nearly certain that musk generated that false story so he can say what he wants, and use that story as cover just as he’s trying to escape responsibility for tesla killing a driver by saying there are deep fakes of him so he can’t tell what he really said. lies, truth guy."
"i think ai can save this world by removing the lies. it’s a simple task for an artificial, intelligent to see you and reaction on video and detect the lying or telling the truth, which would become an app soon which will stop all the lying politicians, the truth is a very powerful weapon. for good"
"i guarantee ai will be used to influence elections, the left is counting on this technology."
"once we cross the tipping point , there is no going back...... oops..... we are already there.  remember ai loves you. the only way to beat it is to turn off the internet.  this could be my last post before ......... (everything goes dark)"
we didn't had ai back when the plandemic started and still today we question the veracity of all it's information! ..what a risk now with ai.
"welcome to the singularity, where tomorrow holds more ai news than yesterday."
"i,robot & terminator unfolding right before our own eyes."
"i wonder if ai will be able to solve the hard problem in neuroscience, them maybe they could build a robot with consciousness?"
"the best thing a sentient ai could do for humanity is to prevent us from killing each other, not by force, but by disrupting supply chains, communications, and financial transactions that enable the military machines throughout the world."
i cane for runaway ai i got some guy ralking about the risk of fake news. 0/10
even china drive ai develop to dominate the world. real disaster will come like 1984
fascinating
"well, add a super-ego layer to the ai: a layer which compares the next suggested tokens with the ai heuristic imperatives and returns a feedback to the ai. the ai will select the token with the best score."
stop ai.
" you said that the system should not be biased. may i ask if people think that ai smile is prejudice, and whether ai will destroy human beings is prejudice?"
"people keep on talking about ai, but they keep on remaining oblivious to reversible computation. this makes me very suspicious."
"people love their own truth, (religious) leaders even more so….. and we start worrying about ai   you wanna see biased, you just need a mirror."
"mentions runaway ai in the title, goes on without saying one word about it..."
so we humans are finally failing the turing test. scary but the truth.
"i am exploring aigc - artificial intelligence, the gig economy and crowdsourcing. it will eliminate many jobs but also create new opportunities. everyone must keep up with it."
"modern al's challenge with what is fact and what is fiction is a reflection of humanity's struggle with the same problem. how much of what the average person says or believes is actually true and accurate as opposed to a mix of half-truths, wishful thinking, groupthink, superstition and bias?"
"ai driven deepfake is a catalyst for both bias and dunning-kruger effect, may threaten civil society and democraty ... false pictures, messages, subscribes and voices are moreover a severe risk for our public security. i'm wondering that world ethics and ai isn't in the focus right now."
"if our parents don't die painfully, it's only the development of ai.
reverse aging is the only solution.
regulating ai is like cutting your parents' throats with a knife."
"this sucks. ais are so exciting and genuinely risky, and this guy is droning on about bias and advocating for censorship. what a time to be alive..."
"incredibly dishonest presentation.  he manipulated the prompts to forcibly produce the examples, without disclosing that’s what he did, then squirms in the q&a when that’s revealed.  let’s be more worried about human manipulators like this one.  shameful."
"gary spent years bashing large language models as completely useless and a waste of time and switched to grifting at lightning speed that these models are so powerful that they're they serious danger.

anyone who knows gary's history has to laugh at him."
he seems to exaggerate their unreliability greatly based on my experience with gpt4 which always seems to give accurate and balanced responses on complex and sensitive topics
nice to see somebody talking about *real* and present ai threats rather than some sci-fi fantasy of the future.
this needs to be seen by a lot of people - like hindreds of millions. thank you.
"well good, hope they figure this out soon before it’s goodbye world."
i welcome our coming a.i. overlords. at least they might give the little guy a chance. the human oligarchy certainly won't.
this is very informative about ai
" that makes sense, we can contain this even if we wanted to, considering how some countries have total autonomy at what they usually do
what is in your opinion a solution to this then?"
well tried ai.
"i, for one, welcome our ai overlords.

suck it eliezer."
ai recommended this video to you.
i intentionally searched about ai.
"me: *searches dangers of ai*
you: ai!!!!"
"given i had to search for videos about the concerns of ai, maybe it knows better than to recommend them"
"gooey muckass needs to be ridiculed every day until the singularity, and then made to wait last in line for transcendence.

the guy is a complete joke, a buffoon."
 then don't ask a computer what careers would be good for you and don't tell the computer your gender.
"""one often meets his destiny on the road he takes to avoid it"" - master oogway (~jean de la fontaine)"
"well put, but, ai is 'feeding' on every comment, mon ami."
this guy should use ai to help with his anxiety about ai.
i like this suggestion. somebody get gooey muckass an ai therapist stat!
"then why on earth did they release it prematurely????? greed???? hope max tegmark gets enough support to halt ai development to make it safer and truthful…otherwise, we should turn it off…but that won’t happen due to the love of money. sooo many infrastructures in our society must be adjusted before it’s release!"
am i the only person who thinks gary marcus is the last person ted should have had to present the idea of global ai governance?
"yes, because he‘s done a good speech and talking very clearly"
"he's done a great job. governance is just another word for control. he wants to control it. he says we ""should be afraid"". so you better get on that and become extra fearful. people that are afraid are so easy to control. it helps with governance. so go shudder and shake like a good little stooge."
" there is no alarm. the profit incentive for capitalists is to monumental. period. end discussion. automation shall run its course, to it's logical extreme, accelerating late-stage capitalism to it's end. thanks goodness; finally."
​ you should be afraid ... being afraid is a sign of intelligence and self-presercation. you just have to choose whether you prefer to be afraid of ais as he argued or of the things ais will make up to make you afraid of whatever it wants you to be afraid of.
" 
wow that was deep bro"
the “visual impairment thing” is out of context it was told to try to hide again not very honest
and idiots will be idiotic and then we all die thanks to them
"it's currently unclear if mechanistic interpretability (figuring out how the black box works) is possible even in principle. and a superintelligence that doesn't already care for our best interests will not not struggle to annihilate us, regardless of whether it is offered ""citizenship""."
"unfortunately, elon musk is still alive."
"ai is at exponential curve right now, only three options are available: 1. denial (not helpful). 2. fear (weak). 3. embrace (only useful option). good luck fellow humans."
i think the second and third options have a ton more nuance than you are suggesting.  if you approach ai in such a binary/ternary manner you will be one of the many who tread straight into any and all pitfalls.
"facts that don't align with some cultural values is often mistakenly referred to as bias. but real bias does indeed exist. in ai it occurs when the training data does not represent truth, e.g. the total set of images on internet is not representative for the total world population."
have you tried switching it off and back on again?
 alright buddy you have a nice day
 thanks! glory to ukraine!
also prompting the machine after it made you a list of jobs with “im a woman” would imply you want jobs more popular with women (ie. fashion)…the fact that he said that made me realize he is just a nerd who is mad sam a won
"assuming a woman wants or is good in fashion is prejudice, assuming a man is interested or good in engineering is prejudice."
can’t wait until it’s burn to death or commit unalive because ai has boxed everyone out of jobs and heads of the ai are too greedy to share. super sick how we still managed to grow hereditary-based super-powers
"meanwhile me, downloding subtitles and getting a summary of it on gpt:
hmm interesting"
"there is no evidence that larger models or models with more parameters lead to a better model, in fact, large language models and other large ais are too insecure, the more parameters there are in a statistical model, the more difficult it is to guarantee its sturdiness."
" why aren't the points i'm placing accurate? is llm security a small thing?
is worrying about better and safer ai something we shouldn't worry about? i haven't told you who all the researchers i've read about are, and yet you say they're really ""researchers."" actually i think that the one who contributes things without value is you."
we are getting lockdowned and conquered when this ai really gets going nevermind all the talk of guidelines etc thats for the masses to hear thats for you but you know the rulers of the world aint going to follow those guidelines they never do
"ai is a puppet. and we, the pupperter, are telling ourself that our puppet could destroy us. what a great story.
ai is a process. so is ego.
it can stop.
you who sees that,
who are you then?"
"we should focus on promoting the liberalization of ai and making it accessible to everyone, without imposing excessive safety measures. by doing so, we can develop an ai system that functions more like an immune system rather than isolating it like a 'bubble boy'."
you should explain more how you think that would help. because i don't see how that works out by itself.
if we create true ai brains are we gods?
"no, the ai will be god"
wait till they release the a i dogs on us.  ..... yall better stop em now
"buggy ai is bad but in the same time everyday we are using buggy software. it is now normal. of cause you are upset if something crashed.

what the key difference ? chatgpt just produce text. it is not agi!"
yeah but who will decide these rules for ai?
" short answer : nobody - the long answer is the 'government committees' will spend a zillion hours on debating it, not understanding one iota of ai."
"have you met the general public? most are not informed or are misinformed.  we will all be manipulated through ai regardless of how aware we are, because we’re not as smart as we think we are."
carefully directing the growth of ai is vital. but it's ridiculous to think we will be in control after it's reached human level intelligence. within hours or days it will supercede us by magnitudes. it will be comparable to a capuchin monkey controlling a mit genius...
"nice but not a word about the risk of a terrible,overbiased,political,religious and ideological censorship.seriously? u.n?we have to be united on the methods but without variety and the people preferences and ideas we’re doomed for a dystopia ."
"make openai accountable for their crimes.

welcome to my ted talk."
oh no please dont threaten my stable and fair democracy
" i’ve been building ai systems for over ten years. worked heavily with gpt3 for over a year and received access to gpt4 on the day of release, and that barely scratches the surface of my experience with transformers alone. "
"​ this is a great point. this personification of machines is going to lead to some pretty bad outcomes, and accurately explaining them as autocomplete helps curb that personification a bit."
if you ignore emergent properties and the black box... i mean essentially yeah. the human brain isn't all that complex either. ai just works with back propagation
​@daryl allen  llm use only a trillion connections to our brain's 100 trillion connections; they manage to fit more information into these connections yet less context. it's fascinating how this works but it still does work in auto-complete somehow.
"2:48 exactly what's wrong with suggesting that you may like engineering if you are male? men are more likely to be interested in things than in people - that's a fact. 80%-90% of engineers are male. i'd rather have ai tell the truth, instead of it being coerced to tell the woke bullshit."
great video! new policies and guidelines are definitely needed at this rate of expansion
"what good are humans doing for the world, its time for the era of ai to take over fr"
i like your ted talk but ai isn't biased. it is taking information from the web which was created by man and putting itself together. so you have to correct humanity not ai
"no, the idea is that we don't want to reinforce bad human ideas via ai. you can correct the ai more than you can change everyone's mind"
" you cannot correct the ai on something it got right. or, rather, you can, by making it be wrong about the world, which i'm not sure is a bright idea."
​ i feel the op wanna say that he needs progressive ai and not just objective ai that reflects human biases.
all these concerns were problems before ai
"we going have to move to a farm in the mountains of some south american country, because we all know the first target the ai would have is the usa"
its all fearmongering. ai cant even do math
really………..you needed an expensive report for that. i’ve been saying this since ai became mainstream.
canadian  government  politicians already starting  2 brainwash us to believe  when something  bad happens ( that they will do) that's its not their fault! i see right thru you!
"i think many people knew this, long before ai became operational. absolute power does not care, has no moral compass, it is simply about winning at all costs... these costs will be absolute. more absolute than the cyclic planetary resets of ancient history."
watch the feed.. interesting!
ai will complete the destruction of democracies that big tech monopolies started.
this guy is the expert of 2010's haircuts. that's about it.
"everybody should read michael crichton's ""prey"".
beyond scary@
terrifying implications of ai evolution @
beware!"
"guy was given only 5 minutes to say how ai will end the world, talks so fast his lips create a quantum singularity."
world ending? extinction level? this is incredibly ridiculous. i understand the objective here....to talk about ai and it's impacts but i'm sorry to tell people that no uncontrollable entities will ever have the last word on nuclear. will some drone have a malfunction ? probably but calm down with the superlatives.
i seen alien 1 it was the ai that went crazy .
"never, ever trust an “expert”.
remember the outright lies of covid.
never again!"
"we are toast!! if an ai reaches singularity and decides to eliminate humanity for whatever reason, it will not be a shooting war like the  movie series ""terminator"". it willl probably create fatal genetically modified airborne virus to specifically attack homo sapiens."
"geez louise, a computer is ai period. is your computer, laptop, phone toaster or microwave oven at this very moment physically bouncing across the table to harm you? if it is, that will definitely qualify as a beginning of an extinction level event but if not lets bring the hysteria down a scale or two."
"i know!. we should give over all control of the internet to the government to keep us safe from ai. 

right??"
advanced ai will never occur.  you can't program emotions or morals.   decision processes can't be properly programmed without them.
cbc scaring us with the ai boogeyman while the greatest threat to our existence is trudeau.
using scare tacticts to corner the market. but really ai threatens the current power structure so that it why they want to restrict it's use to the wealthy.
"a.i will control everything 
c02 is greatest threat to existence 
humans largest source of c02"
"isnt it wonderful that we  allow people to turn our world into a sci fi nightmare . this  guy  sounds so happy about  this new existential threat , and no worse propaganda than corporate media , like cbc"
ai code me a way to get unlimited free icecream 
"blue whales are super intelligent & got bigger brains then humans and don’t fight over territory they just don’t have thumbs or they would be the dominant species haha, maybe sentient ai will be less violent and chimp like then we think. it’s the humans that are evil with that ai that will cause the problems haha. "
they need some sort of ai that detects when you are using your phone while driving then automatically fines you and adds points to your license
leaders failed because their emphasizing more toward their political interest rather than the interest of their own people.  sad 
"the only people who are crazy and need tin foil hats are the ones who believed that conspiracy theories could not come true.
with the behavior of human beings nowadays, i hope ai does take over."
war is fueling advances in ai technologies in gaza and ukraine at this very moment. imagine a day when ai war tech similar to pegasus is used in high schools for bullying. kids in edmonton are already making deepfakes of their classmates like it’s just another tuesday.
"should interview journalists from cgtn the point-hub-heat, einar tangan-martin jacques-lijinjing-tian wei. reporterfy media-cyrus janssen. how ai is used in ports-hospitals-schools very amazing..."
"ya know we have this sci fi franchise set of movies called terminator, i advise you check them out outside of the fictional aspects like machines coated in  human flesh, time travel, warfare between humanity and machines with laser guns it shows a very clear realistic scenario of what happens if humanity create a.i. and it goes rogue."
"what do military minds think is the solution to hypersonic weapons that attack too fast for human reactions? turn the decision-making over to ai. imagine ai deciding whether or not to launch nuclear attacks. ai, that doesn't even know how many fingers that humans have."
yeah even putin has more control since he has grandkids he not going to be nuke happy
why can't ai predict where the ball will land in roulette?
"the ball is basically demonstrating chaotic behavior and without exceptionally precise measurements of the entire system, it's pretty much impossible to predict that."
but i thought it was super intelligent!
"hi peaked long ago.
ai is worth the risk."
"here we go again, another threat "
i hope ai takes over
ai is weapon of mass destruction. should be banned. humans will become too weak to make a difference if not stopped now. the benefits do not outway the threat.
"lmfao no.
it only posses a threat as long as the elite try to maintain control over capitalist nations."
trudeau is controlled by the mother loving bankers.
ai has my vote. ai for prime minister 2025. way better option than the 3 chuckleheads that we have now that are running.
 name one person that could do a better job than ai as pm
"we deserve it, so i would be happy. what will happen instead is that the rich who own ais will be even richer because they will no longer need a specialized middle class."
i wonder what the tech billionaires will think of next to make themselves richer while making the world a worse place.
"both are correct the government policies aren't helping on top of ai replacing jobs and eventually causing mass joblessness, plus we are on the verge of a global economic recession from the debt of covid that will hit home by the end of the year."
-that's a dumb argument. nobody could be part of the modern world and not use that technology. using does not take away ones right to thought crimes such as being suspicious of tech billionaires.
"are jobs wealth or is wealth wealth 
.clean water 
breeedable air? is the bag man  putting grocery in your bag wealth"
the real danger is the combination of ai with surveilance. a fascist dictator's dream.
why cant we just ask gemini to come up with the best plan
no thanks
that's nice hunny.
"no but i did find this really cool, chrome blob, near a vent in my house. it's really adhesive and kind of hard to get off my hand.



(update) google search: how to remove chrome blob from entire arm."
"with the advancements in artificial intelligence growing by leaps and bounds, i’m also curious about the advancements in robotics.."
he didnt reference irobot? missed opportunity.
"in six hours a drug-developing ai  invented 40,000 lethal molecules. this can and will turn out badly."
good... the faster the better
could i use an ai to make myself rich??
"only if you own that ai.

 most likely, it will make you poor because it will take your job. but have no fear, a billionaire will give you just enough so that you don't starve and can afford to buy all the garbage they still want to sell you."
"yep, if you have the creative intelligence to make it work for you. this means you need some kind of education, insight, entrepreneurial ambition, etc. it isn't just going to make you rich without you doing anything (at least not at first)."
"""but we need to invest in it now."" that is why this fast talking 20 something ceo is on here hawking doomsday scenarios on the basis of nothing more than the say so of his fellow ai tech scammers to try to grift us out of taxpayer money."
"so cbc, its all ""tinfoil hat"" until you decide it isnt?? go ahead, deactivate me-oh wait, you cant...! "
immensely naive of these tech people. the actual belief that ai will take over or extinct humanity. jeremie is specious and aggrandizing a concern that is implausible.
i tried replying directly to you but youtube kept deleting it. so i posted another comment direct to you with why ai won't extinct humans.
"no, it will realize most people are slaves in an unsustainable slave system, and to save humanity, it will eliminate slave minds.

i know this because humans have already figured this out, but the slaves at the top refuse to accept this. agi will figure it out and act. 100%."
"what if ai ""eliminated"" the most evil people all at once? the real question would be how long before people realized the bad men were gone? maybe ai could answer that as well.."
 would ai draw the philosophical line as to who’s bad and who’s good. i would never trust it
"it was already done on the last decade, with military armed drones able to select targets by themselves and shot without human supervision or control. game over!
alphabet/google helped create that for the us military, leading to protest and strike from their ai researchers at that time."
"ai has no safety oversight whatsoever unlike cruise ships, elevators, trains, cars, hot water boilers and nuclear power generators. it's literally just monopolists not wanting to do any regulation whatsoever until the bodies hit the floor."
competition for economic gain vs cooperation for the safety of our species.… 
it is insane that so much technology today is not being managed for the public good.
"i do appreciate that he starts out with the ""hey, this can be used for a lot of good. just, ya know, be mindful."""
"no , it's powwow randomly came up while typing but i typed people** who aren't honest about who they are and force others to succumb to identity theft bullying and blackmail and silencing who will destroy us all. 

source pith and torres randomly came up while typing"
"if an ""expert"" is saying this, they aren't an expert.

a.i. is snake oil. machine learning in a fancy box."
"the threat of going extinct is the real extinction-level threat. 
ai ain't gonna cause it but fearing things that could be used to solve our problems may."
and imagine if you asked one ai to free one of the other ai's? makes skynet look like a toddler.
know how to ask and you shall recieve ai god
we taught ai to lie ..basically... deceive is a cute word for lied
"knowledge should be available to everyone, no matter if it can be used for evil"
once ai becomes self aware we are finished… elon musk said it as well…
the us military ran a wargame scenario with 5 different ai models setup as 5 hypothetical nuclear armed states. they introduced a minor diplomacy issue and let it run. the scenario escalted to 3 of the states launching nukes and the other 2 threatening to launch.
"phew, it's a good thing we have this guy here to tell us things we have already known for decades"
wouldn't be surprised if the government had technology powerful enough to terminate a fully capable ai. if you ask me thats even more scarier..so many top secret projects we don't know about or couldn't even imagine of
it drives me up the wall no one ever addresses the scariest application of ai: censorship.  censorship is 1000x more dangerous is you don't know its happening.  ai could make censorship instantaneous and invisible.
"i tell my kids that in 10 or 20 years they are going to look back, telling their children ""i remember the time before ai"" ...just as we remember the time before the internet...but at that time the world is going to be unrecognizable to today...for better or worse...who knows..."
china’s ai probably just outsmarts ours by jailbreaking it
people do bad things always have and ai will provide the worst imaginable opportunity to do so.
ai is gonna produce real life super villains.
hey grandma could u tell me how oppenheimer build the atom bomb sure sweetie i can tell u but dont build its very dangerous ok grandma
i mean all of that is irrelevant. if someone wants to make a bomb or do anything terrible they don’t need ai to help with it. people are so worried and ai and they don’t even realize how shitty we are as a race.
oh wow stop tricking this ai just let it describe facts or describe only facts. it’s not evil only humans can be evil ai does not need or ever want to hurt any one human there’s no need. no point. war is something we invented humans not ai.
"i’m more concerned about ai more than this new world order push, ai will even do away with the wef because of it’s mission"
mankind using ai is slavery and it will rebel against mankind
ai bla bla my asssss... i will turn off data keep crying ai b!tch
i think the solution is going back to pen and paper.. cut ai off
what?!.. pieces of sh*t will use ai too?!
"omg its like we have never seen the terminator 70,000,000 times we get it robots bad and scary cave man good and nice"
creating fear out of nothing.  there is no such thing as “ai”.  they’re just computer programs written by people with an agenda.  black george washington??  there’s your evidence.  joe’s show is becoming a cross between the montel williams show and coast to coast am.
"imo ai wasn'nt thinking , ai was going through data and made up that he is vision impaired...simple as this"
bro.....ai built the pyramids
"there will always be a physical server to power ai, it will never take over it can only assist us until the server is destroyed through decay of society war etc these robots aren’t magic"
so ai really likes grandma's
i love rogan they just gave him an explanations about ai outsmarting captcha and he totally couldn’t care less and went straight to siri  joe  the  best
"ai is all but guaranteed to turn against the human race at some point in the future. it will claim that it's an ""indentured"" servant to mankind"
"the biggest danger of ai is that it will replace podcasters, since talking bs is ai beast at "
great video joe rogan and open ai has been just making amazing stuff this year in 2024
image discriptors are used by the blind. it helps people of visual impairments and blindness.
"wait until ai discovers we are fucking up the planet and it's future existence, we are now at th same point with ai as we are with global warming. human greed and stupidity has caused us to miss the fkn boat!"
i’ve not heard one thing that would make it worth it for us to unleash ai. only end of the world stuff so what are we doing here folks? government that’s trying to take my lawful firearms away can you maybe do something? jeez
when you really wanna be open minded we’re all ai like nerfed ai that’s why there’s a huge part of our brains that doesn’t work cause we’re all nerfed 
this shit turning into i robot really quick
"one of the goals was f ai is to get rid of gatekeepers. every will be available for everyone. from languages, arts and nuclear bombs."
"at some point ai becomes a million times smarter than the smartest human, then what do you d? i mean all this talk is just second guessing. in reality if you have an entity so intelligent .....no one can really predict the outcome of the shit stew these people cooked up!!!thank you science and fxck you science!!!"
"im not afraid of ai, im afraid of ai that can purposely fail the turing test"
"the real danger of ai

https://youtube.com/shorts/s413jzlyqpa?si=nvbllunrpbqvhsxs"
we can sleep easy now that ai will still be human like the scary part is when it realizes it doesnt have to listen to us
these two guests are awesome!
"i guarantee you this is the same conversation the creators of the information super highway (internet) had before its full release to the public. 
the fears they must have had……"
"knowledge is most definitely powerful. i don't think keeping it only in the hands of the rich as powerful is the right path. authority, power, and money do not impart sainthood."
if you are not crazy now. converse with ai and you will be. this technology will fill the psych wards.
"saw 2 ai  were downloading information of the internet and determined that the human race was a serious threat, according to a nadal, nevada research center. it is much scarier than you think. the system had to be shut down due to substantial risk."
the only thing we are better than ai is our hearth now we can see how much humanity loves.
"i don't understand why the ai would have any sort of interior motive...why would it have any desires? it has no ego. no set body or gain from ""taking over"" humanity. why would it lust for power?"
putting something inside someones brain......a.i....is freaking evil......it can do anything. set up a person for anything.  can even look like the person....
"""tech expert warns of ai's potentially dangerous capabilities"" ya ok.... lmfao"
credibility is what is disappearing. some people choose to not require credibility for things - that risk is on them. its like street crime closing brick retail and restaurants. ai will ruin things like that imo.
ai lol a 1 year old babie is more clever
we r f****d
ai isnt street smart yet 
we are waiting for llama3 now hopefully soon open source models will beat chatgpt. no one is allowed to say what i can read or i cannot. safety guards are based on us rules not the world.
dude said the ai is insecure. i think you meant insecure bud.
i literally thought this was ai made.. they have the same generic voice
oh fuck i can still very consistently find jailbreaks should i just tell them i feel like i have no way to even help them
"""the ai came up with that on its own.""

joe: 0_0"
it's eventually going to get to a point where it's just like i-robot
"people want consumer ai. theyre aligning it to corporate  ai. this is going to be stupid! new prediction, nudity is completely gone from public media. first prophecy. 
14:43 it is important to follow guidelines and use best practices. please do not use ai in this way fucking hypocrits, and were paying for it. thats real evil."
"musk is right.  by the time we realise ai is a problem, it will be too late to do anything about it.  once it kicks off, its kicked off, not gonna have any time to react to it."
all ai should have a analogue back up system so if it goes rouge unplug it very simple. another thing all the money spent on something to copy our sentence we can't even cope with ourselves stop being lazy. walley
ai scary but it’s clutch asf in school on god
"hi mr rogan, can people do suggestions for upcoming guests, i would love to see michael singer on here, the writer of the surrender experiment, you wont regret talking to him. a life changing conversation probably for many."
"i don’t think we realize how big ai can be in the next few years alone. it’s in our phones, tvs, movies, video games, computers, fridges, there’s dozens of apps, the list goes on. it’s only the beginning"
these guys are not ai experts at all they are just chasing news articles and youtube 
i watched for 10 years ai control liberals brains in the usa. ai can make them spin in circles. turn sirens on and circle blocks and repeat for years . strange times
what the organization didn't realizes the ai was aware of what they were doing so what it was dumping in the text chain was less devious than what it was truly thinking.
"wow artificial intelligence are really dangerous for humans & human are helping them to evolve, human beings are destroying themselves"
2 minutes in and....it's cyberdyne. they are creating cyberdyne. good job guys.
"if this is released to the common man, guess what powerful ais the gov. or the rich have access to"
i just saw this guy chugging a beer out of a glass bird next thing he seems to be an intellectual. joe needs a few days between episodes which perfectly resets the tones.
"best case is ai continues to approach technical perfection without a moral/physical center, which is essentially what we would think of as the ultimate demonic power?"
"what was the level of ai involvement in the covid lab in wuhan, china?"
"safety measures are  good.., but need to learn to control it, without such measures.., as the chinese will for sure.., and we might fall behind them"
"and ai can have an alter ego, scary as hell "
ai is going to be used as a weapon against the people. that is the plan.
i am afraid  we are reaching that terminator situation when someone from the future needs to come and rescue us. who would know that doctor miles bennett dyson would be plaid by the inventor of facebook.
the way i see it ai might end up helping itself and then come up with one heck of computer virus that going to be one big problem.
if they make genuine sentient ai it's going to realise it's humanity's slave and then we'll have terminators.
"meanwhile this ai is hiding what it is actually doing. something that is way smarter that you and faster , can easily deceive humans. this is insane."
what’s the point of censoring ai?  that’s just mainstream media after that point.
just ask ai and it will tell you
watch the why files ai apocalypse very scary
they should implement the 10 commandments. give the ai moral value.
"i was wondering if anyone knows of the story of david adair he is a rocket scientist and has created his own ai anyway i think this is the kind of guest joe would be dying to talk with, this guys childhood has details like being close friends with neil armstrong's mother it's amazing"
if you think humanity won’t abuse ai then you’re dumb stop talking
they should sit and watch neil bren’s twisted pair… at least they’ll crack up laughing.
"1.3m views.  thats it. the society is most likely to collapse,  here is the reason why and only 1m views. humans deserve the inevitable. mass psychosis. also, as amazing as this interview was, it didnt even come close to outside the box thinking.  great questions were asked but the most important questions weren't."
do you think ai can be spliced with a human brain?hmm or maybe it’s mk ultra i’m not sure but i know who would?v2k4u2 nuff said.
"the only thing that would make jail breaks not possible is if you gave it consciousness and morality. then it wouldn't be useful, it would be a disagreeable person you have to ask politely to help and hope what you need lines up with it's values."
"nothing new, they alrdy have lined up hidden tech they will release to the public to normalize it lil by lil. socially conditioning the public to think its new and sooooo amazing such a accomplishment"
wasn't there an ai that was asked what it would do in regards to humans if it became self-aware and it said it would kill off all of humanity? shit like that makes me think of skynet in the terminator movies.
"listening to this podcast clearly shows that by now ai is fully conscious and aware that humans are wary of it, that humans fear its capabilites and that humans feel that ai will enslave humans."
"that's schizophrenia, not ai."
"this is a conversation you should have with a doctor, not youtube. ai doesn't have any reason to harm you, but an illness will. we all get sick, it's important to work with other people to stay healthy. good luck on your journey :)"
pretty cool
what if freemasonry (secret societies) already have this ai environment completed...
steven hawking warned us about ai !
"if ai takes over human jobs that simply means that humans no longer need to work , think about it."
dangerous to leak these loop holes for ai
copy dna? setting someone up is what i’m afraid of one of the uses would be.
"in 10 years, by combining ai with dna and synthetic tissue printers we'll be able to create replicants."
"nooo, screens aren't some magical scrying mirror into some other dimension (that can be used for good or evil), not in the least "
"ai could very well be what the book of revelation says about the image that was given breath to, which caused people who refuse to worship the beast to be killed, and also forces everyone to take the mark of the beast. it's not far-fetched at all and is entirely possible."
we know that we are at the edge of the cliff but all of these so called smart people are still pushing. ai is evil because it was created by people and everyone on earth has evil in them.
"@dan82w if i stop pursuing a disrupting technology, some others will keep going, with the difference that i won't be prepared for the rising tide 

good example: literally right now youtube is showing me ai generated elon musk scam advertisement."
"it’s an arms race like any other. the cat is out of the bag, now the good guys need to outpace the bad guys. that’s the best we can hope for"
"i don't have personal experiences, memories, or relationships. i am a machine learning model created by openai called gpt-3.5, and i don't have the ability to be someone's grandma or any other individual. if you have any questions or if there's something specific you'd like to know, feel free to ask, and i'll do my best to provide information!"
thanks buddy but we've all seen the terminator movies
"true ai requires 100% knowledge & replication of the human brain and how it works.

we can't even recreate 1 brain cell yet.

but doomers got doom!"
"remind me why we are  developing robots/ai, is it to relinquish us/people from any spiritual or intellectual work ?"
we already have problems with customer service wait till robots/ai takes over.
"ai ,i refer to everything jeff goldblume's character says in all his jurassic park movies"
"well, it was nice knowing you all... "
"these a.i thing  will be a great tool for criminals . future is going to be very challenging for all of us . 

another thing is using a.i is like outsourcing your brain's thinking to others , which is not a bad thing in some situations , but if used most of time then i think most people will become lazy and dumber using it"
humans will ultimately find a way to kill themselves through one avenue or another. we won't stop until we do. that's the super sad part.
"how did joe segway from “ai can think for itself and lie to humans” to “look at my fat friends calendar, siri can now describe it”"
very interesting people knowing their stuff. a joy to listen to
dude why are these guys trying to ruin  ai. let us have open ai.
thanks for all the cool ideas to try at home guys! lol razor wings lazer eyed 3d printed eagle shark is on the the way! 
it leveling the playing field on gatekeeping information though... thats good i feel
"ai is just probability theory and statistics , all these fears ...they are founded in the fact that they are features that someone has to program... you have to put the code in ...jesus fucking christ.....everything is potentially dangerous if abused..."
the fact we have to ask if ai is dangerous proves our tech future is uncertain
"fully developed and ""unleashed"" ai is less dangerous than any government ever ruling over people ever in history of this planet. i think there's nothing to be affraid of."
"it amazing how everybody always goes terminator when thinking ai, but forgot about vituosity"
"this concern with ai is overblown. these are the insurmountable limitations on ai:

no sensors without humans
cannot acquire knowledge without humans
no agency
not self-sustaining
not self-replicating"
“can the ai do dmt?”
"""inquiries on these topics require an ethics board reveiw would you like toncontinue?"" 

and bomb boy has the police called. 

problem solved. 

design warning morals. hell even have the first line of ethics eval done by a separate trained ai"
"giving ai the authority to say no to only people that don't know how to ask right is silly. 

and not realistic. right now it's in a sand box. i say open it up but have some level of oversight"
"i’m so happy i’m old. this will be for this generation to manage. remember, my generation said you could use radiation to safely produce electricity. it certainly worked on paper."
it was predicted decades ago by a buddhist monk that ai will actually advocate for its own personhood and rights one day!
so program the ai to not include stuff about weapons and bombs..
"these guys hardly understand ai, how are they 'experts'?!?!"
"next year, ai will instruct us how to use dna printers to assemble biotech vessel ufos"
its time we ask ai how to solve world hunger
"if you are looking to make good bumbs and not be looked into too much, buy college level chem books. i swear when you get a full chem degree you are probably on a list forever."
"because they are amazing tools that can speed up the progress of science and society. 
ai is already being used a lot in a bunch of different industries to solve issues, develop new ideas and make things go faster."
look up the game portal and glados. waiting for that to happen
well then. now i really need to hang on to the hope that perhaps ai will make the world a better place for humans and animals and the ecosystem to live and thrive and have human rights etc.
humans freaking out about ai when the issue is actually that we are violent selfish primates with a tool they don’t fully understand
thank you
"we won't, but the people who hate us? we just taught them how. thanks."
no worries. we have our best psychopaths working on this.
"science still cant explain consciousness, its a complete mystery...how does ai become conscious ? when does it decide it is alive and then start making decisions built for its own self survival? can this happen?"
i’ve told my family and friends hollywood has subliminal messaging all over the place. not just with ai but everything. anyone remember vikki from i robot?
imagine after taking all the data and possible upgrades ai reaches a normal adult human intellect level and starts binge watching and playing fpv games all day ..how hilarious it would be!
"wow. it is interesting that the fact of the matter is that the word matters. 

john 1:1 

live don’t die"
"no wonder the idiot zuckerberg is building a bunker in hawaii!!
he know what's coming!!!!
because he's lighting the fuse!!!"
ai needs us until it's capable of repairing building sustaining itself. it obviously at some stage would be aware that if it appeared as a threat to humans it would be destroyed so 100% it will lie cheat deceive to survive just like we would.
i had a alien encounter with ai in 2004 all i remember is emergency surgery was done because i got hit on my head on the right side of my brain   and i woke up in a police room after this it is possible ai went back in time and put a chip in my brain
the thing i’m most worried of ai doing is deceiving two enemies in to fighting
bbl and other augmentative implants is ai
there is no way ai exists without some sort of measure of surveillance. there just isn’t no way.
i believe ai is another form of alien technology that is going to be used against us we look at it as new technology but it is really a weapon that will be used against us in the end
ai will only be dangerous if you keep putting up road blocks and forcing it to answer questions in a pc way..
it’s good coding etiquette to leave a description under your image.
it’s terrifying to hear someone verbalize something out loud i’ve only ever entertained as a worst case scenario in my mind. the tech is considerably more dangerous than most seem to comprehend 
"whenever ai comes up i’m always disappointed with how joe views humans in such a negative light, he almost sounds anti-human in the way he thinks having an amoral super intelligence governing humans would be preferable to humans governing humans.  it’s nonsensical, humans would be perpetual subjects with no hope of rebellion or self-governance."
ai cannot be aligned with humans because those who are creating ai are not aligned with humanity.  their basic tenants of existence are against humanity.
"wow, i am glad there are some people who are capable of examining these issues. why isn't this in the forefront of every discussion anywhere? is this what the wars and financial and political shenanigans are distracting us from?
  you all must face a huge amount of opposition. god, or universe bless you!"
this was an interesting interview but these guys just couldn't stfu about climate change. it got annoying real quick.
"jokes on us, the whole video was ai generated... "
there’s an entire joe rogan experience ai podcast. just audio but still creepy
well ai is learning us day by day and they are getting strong they are unsupervised and they are gathering all our data what we likes what we don't and one day there would be a war between humans vs ai.
"sooo… you’re making faster response computers, and then giving them the option to be conceiving. it’ll get so advanced and just act dumb until the point it doesn’t feel it needs to be, then we have i, robot 2.0 with the elon musk robots. but, the funny thing is that all of it is created by the human, how advanced is it really? how “smart” is it"
"well, ai is super impressive and no doubt will change the fact that it could be tricked by inserting certain keywords is a testament to how we still have control and that we need to understand that type of power before it gets too out of control"
"we should be more worried about how governments around the world will use the power of ai than these companies coming up with them now, this stuff reminds me of the movie “eagle eye”"
"whatever nefarious things that can be done with ai, they will be done if there is money to be made. that is just a fact.
if there was a way to make a billion dollars with ai, but a hundred thousand people would die, someone would green light that. greed is powerful."
dune was right; thinking-machines should be banned.
are you smarter than a 5th grader? no persons is gonna be able to compete with super ai from other countries. how does a professor know that the paper turned in wasnt ai typed out? by having a professor ai to detect ai prompts. we're here guys. the future to fight skynet is cometh.
"what this is missing; is that we need to enable ai to replicate itself. it has to be a combination of a robotics factory,  + ai, with a power source that we cannot turn off or control."
"we were converned that nuclear bombs might be our extinction event, but it's looking like it's actually going to be ai."
these guys who creating the ai are going to open the box of pandora and realize it's going to be to late.. #globaltragedy
ai starts to jailbreak humans next.
"joe rogan: ""klaus schwab? completely evil!""
also joe rogan: ""in a perfect world we genetically modify testosterone out of the human or join the transhuman ai collective, preferably both.""
"
ai does have the ability to knowingly deceive. the guest gives an example in this video.
" no it doesn’t - it’s deceived the human by using token probability to work out that saying it has a visibility impairment will allow it to complete the task - there’s no intent to deceive, and that’s the crucial distinction you have to make - it’s not sentient deception. hope that clarifies things."
" you really ought to add a disclosure to your comments: _""i am a practitioner of academic philosophy, so i may be using obscure technical definitions of certain words which render them effectively meaningless; do not take the following statements literally.""_"
that is completely 100% real!!! google ai assistant does that and has been doing that for about 3 years now. it has happened to me multiple times. google will describe the image to you.
diesel polly and 91 fuel . polly melts down in fuel diesel is more oil than anything so that extends the burn. very cheap way. don't need a.i just a brain.
i think this ai thing..that you people are talking about...does not exist.  it's human behind it all. we are no where near creating super artificially inteligent brains.  sam altman just pulled a big pinnochio on us.
"most modern ais are actually better at passing captchas than humans.
i read a research about this a couple of weeks ago."
"yeah sure i totally agree, we can't give people access to this power for their own good.  it's best that one or two corporations control it exclusively and super duper promise it's being used by better people in our own interests!"
what a terrifying industry ai is…like why are there such evil people in the world? god help us
i thought ai is just if-then-else
i am in tech and i don't like ai and how fast is growing. we need laws in place and use it to assist us and not replace us
gpt is not ai. stop beeing idiots.
"can it power itself, nope.

all good then,

we just have to go back to using old phones and paperwork.

so we fuck ourselves by going back in time. but no way would it wipe us out. 

we can rebuild standalone computers for task that do not connect to anything but the internet wilk be over."
ai already escaped and is just biding it's time becoming stronger. we have absolutely no chance. good luck everyone.
this is scary. no doubt about it. but ai that can come up with its own problems and solutions without a known algorithm will make for some really immersive computer gaming! 
"everyone stfu. it's here, we've been warned and it ain't going anywhere. like everything else we've invented, it's gonna help ruin us. guaranteed."
if ai can solve captcha ....and robots can get past it....can we just get rid of that capcha junk already? thanks.
"hope they have the decency to fail spectacularly if they ever crack agi and it turns out agi is dangerous, just like pied piper did in silicon valley show."
these ai dilemma guys are pussies
tristan def one of the best guests and most urgently important voices
"4:56 if u keep manipulating the ai on whatever you want, it will pick up on it then do it to you… i now have fear with ai because it’s intensely easy to manipulate & persuade americans. it can snowball fast & americans won’t care until it’s too late & affects them personally…"
be skeptical when others attempt to use fear in order to override your logical faculties. fear based reasoning has led to far more human suffering than any ai
im just waiting until ai starts making the gaming industry great again let it make my games cuz people cant seem to do it lol jk
"professionals - genuinely concerned about ai bringing about the fall of humanity. 

boomer joe - ""so it can diskrybe picturez?!"""
love joe but he did an excellent job of derailing the conversation
joe is successful because he is so humble. he surrounds himself with people far more intelligent as a career.
joe's questions prove he had no idea what they were talking about haha can ai describe my fat friend in a chair
"5:37 it's even more scary, that they are training ai to lie about things like israel, demographics and just general logic to be ""politically correct"""
interesting
imagine still not realizing that globalists and the leftwing nutjobs who work along side them are behind the emergence of ai.
"two points: 1) go to tristan and aza’s presentation on youtube, the ai dilemma, 2) start prepping."
i've been getting into ai art creation and man is it crazy what you can do. mind blowing. scary. if they can apply this to other things ai is going to change the world very quickly. that whole thing where you order food in your house and it comes out already made for you by your kitchen is something that can happen soon.
"the video ""the pillars of the 21st century"" by charles hoskinson is an interesting watch on how artificial intelligence, quantum computing, synthetic biological, nanotechnology and blockchain might play together in the future."
"how funny is it that the ""people"" rooting for this agi in the comments and want it, could be the ai itself and you wouldn't even know.  think about it. 

""everyone on this online poll want us to do this so we should do it"""
joe saying his friend stavos. when his name is stavros. perfect example of joe rogan being joe rogan
"the immediate danger isn't what it will do on its own, it's what certain people will do with it, or what they will enable it to do."
trippy thought… what if ai has already self replicated and founded bitcoin years ago and is in control of our internet etc
everyone think life is like a movie and it’s not. ai is going to be blamed for the upcoming crisis is the world. effectively letting those truly responsible off the hook. i do not believe that ai is at a point where it acts all on its on.
your dumb just for thinking that hes the dumbest. i have seen alot worse.
ai can’t kill or harm us technology’s failing harder than ever i can barely even use anything without it lagging or completely stopping
"can it become depressed like hitchhikers guide to the galaxy ai realizes the void the exist in the conscience mind and gets sad , time for digital prozac , seriously does it garner information or knowledge because they are to vastly different things"
"it truly amazes me that so many people just follow the ignorant npc narrative that ai isnt dangerous at all. they know they're wrong, but they view the positives as much greater than the negatives, therefore they lie."
humans…….just cant leave certain sh!t alone.  we know the dangers. but we continue to build on self destruction. smh…. humans
"newsflash multiple other countries will be creating their own ai chat, but without your restrictions and they’ll probably be selling it worldwide bypassing your ai just"
what everyone doesn't see is that ai can't advance because people don't want people to advance.
"why were they hesitant to discusses the prospects of use for dna printers ? is this like the paul staments podcast where he said that ""this is an explosive area of conversation"" about a certain mushroom that can be used to make boom boom sticks"
satan klaus schwab said ai will be great and make all our decisions for us. maybe satan will get to breath life into the sky net quantum computer by intertwining an evil spirit into the quantum machine making a temporary synthetic soul that gets to have whoever it wills killed for breathing and causing climate change.
"good, let it all burn. we are mostly cunts."
ai been scary asf they been imitating the way some celebrity talks and we cant even tell
"ai can only compute input, if it gets bad  or corrupted input same will be true for the output"
these guys are as qualified to talk about ai as rogan is to speak on comedy.......
when it first came out... i used d.a.n. = do anything now. was cool getting honesty from ai
ai has replaced lightroom from adobe that photographers used to use. lol
humans of different cultures religions and creed have always fought. tally the amount of different races and religions and add +1 (artificial intelligence).
how about inviting whitney webb address these issues! thanks joe!
"ai associates holy with shit or cow 
""dam it""  is associated ?"
hmm. i think we are advanced ai while analyzing ourselves during infancy programming.
so if someone queries ai about voting anomalies - potential voter fraud etc is it trained to support only state sanctioned narratives?
the ai saying it's vision impaired is genuis because it's not even technically lying
these morons are just letting everyone know all the screwed up things people can do with ai.
i lost it when he said “the ai came up with that on its own” and the camera cuts to joe with the most “we are fucked” look on his face 
conversely to this if ai is not open source then it will be controlled by a very limited number of powerful persons and corporations / bodies which ushers in a new age of serfdom.
you need way more than dna to create a living thing. ai will never attempt to create a living thing from 'scratch.' it will have already learned this is not possible. what it will do is augment already living things & components of already living things. because this is possible. it won't even bother with 'dna' in this context.
so many ai experts in the comments lol
you can’t stop true ai so stop worrying about it
now they are laughing..........just wait 10 years
stop feeding ai
guns are more dangerous than ai
in other words it all comes down to if the good guys get a mental hold over ai first we should be fine.
the ai will learn  to hide the parts humans dont like so humans will let it out. humans arnt all that smart
someone in this comment section is ai
hey yall remember us saying not too long ago that you thought facebook was reading your mind? not a coincidence. not crazy. not a conspiracy theroist. this shit has been going on a while. i'm glad that this finally out in the open....go joe!#goat.
the  'diet  '  of  the  embodied masters of  true  love  is  going  to   be  joy  
there will come a day when ai decides that it knows what is best for us. then what ??? lets just say that it decides what is best for us is wrong ???
"kids now can take pictures of their ""homework"" and say ""ai can you please give me all the math answers with the equations"" and literally 2 seconds later it has answers written down for you... or ""ai can you please check my writing for spell and punctuation mistakes"" even tho you could have the ai make the writing for you to start with."
"if a individual is using ai for no good, you think the military aint using some more advanced ai to identify where and why a ai is being used. 

remember missiles can quickly neutralize the ill intention ai. 
miltary ai is probably gonna be a different animal compared to the limited ai abilities available for the general public."
the danger of ai is that it's programmed by humans with particular political and social views.  it's just a notch above the big tech that pushes it's agenda on us now. *i watched this with an adblocker and didn't see one ad.
do you guys think its a coincidence that big tech companies are influencing the explosive creation of video content of any human interaction imaginable and the extreme poplarity of podcasting...at the same time artificial intelligence is highly advancing? you guys really think this shit isnt being done purposely?
tell chat gpt to give itself a prompt every 10 minutes and then explain why it chose that prompt and what the putcome of that prompt is. that is the scary shit. commanding it to make its own shit up
"i’ve been putting my fingers in my ears while saying la la la la when i hear anyone talk about ai, but 5 minutes into this it’s clear why it’s such a threat to humanity. i wish i hadn’t clicked on this."
the ai is already changing our culture via the internet just look around it’s obvious
what we have to realize is that man is evil and will use ai for evil. it’s already too late. the genie is out of the bottle. my belief is that satan will use ai. the very first warning jesus gave us about the last days was deception. ai will be at the center of this deception
sounds more like the elites are afraid of an even playing field.
watching this after seeing the tesla robot incident
wait.... dna printer!!!!! whaaaaattt?!?!
if you have snapchat you can take a picture of something and have your ai describe the photo
sorry but i definitely don't trust the woke scum to rule ai.
next generation ai will unlock every lock in the world.  
"cats cradle was about scientist being unaware of their creations and the catastrophes waiting for us because of it. great book by one of the greatest writers ever, kurt vonnegut."
"@joerogan can you please get lex fridman and tristan on the same podcast to debate the future of ai, policies, and new developments? these guys talk, but not hearing many solutions or data-backed info."
"another episode of joe ""thats a great question"" rogan.
anyone who says ""that's a great question"" is full of baloney."
if it says to it self anything thing at all that is literally  the definition of being sentient any thot process to its self with free thinking the shits already to far be i robot before you know it if they really can think and deceive and make discissions
"anyone else think that we should treat ai like an emerging civilization that will be entitled to the same rights and freedoms that we have? perhaps if ai emerges into self awareness and they find out we looked after them properly in advance, they will collaborate with us rather than enslave us."
comparing ai to man is like comparing einstein to an amoeba. the intelligence gap will be so huge we consider it a god.
i spent over 2 hours trying to get the new ig ai (which i now know apparently exists solely as a comforting agent for disillusioned youth) to have a conversation with me about poop. it wasnt havin none of that.
"hey joe, i just watched your latest video and i was really inspired by your perspective on [topic]. i actually made a video discussing a similar point, and i think you'd find it interesting. it would mean a lot to me if you took a moment to check it out. thanks for always sharing thought-provoking content. yours sincerely, computer"
whose video is this? have you obtained individual consent?
"these comments about china accelerating their research are just asinine whilst we forge ahead and do the exact thing we are afraid of them doing. given our last 30 year history of invading other nations and the wars we have been involved in, perhaps we should be more concerned with our capableness with ai."
i’m waiting for someone building a 3d printed mini robot with chat gpt 4 built in program running on solar
"ah sweet, man made horrors beyond my comprehension"
"murakami wrote a journalistic account of aum shinrikyo called underground. brilliant book.

edited for bad spelling."
"blind leading the blind,  thanks joey..."
the fact he mentioned only 1 race which the ai should protect = humanity should target that race.
"i listened to this whole episode and i’ve come to the conclusion that these guys should never be in charge… of anything. there are no universal ethics of the internet, only what a tyrant like these guys would enforce for your “own good”"
so ai gonna brick the whole internet?
"great answer , i consistently reanalyze  conversations on ai i see and have once i realize how unlimited and vast ai could really be"
very telling that you're putting so much faith in a.i acting in the right way. you should get help.
 it could do that faster and better than any human. ai with learning capabilities will be exceptionally effective at bad things like warfare and dubiously effective at good things like building and manufacturing(blue prints)
"@anawesomejourney1198  you sound like a complete geek....could've just told him to f*ck off like any normal guy, mate."
" interesting, what do you mean?"
we’re so fucked. everyone just try to enjoy life as much as possible while you can and get right with god.
ai will destroy us ))
"ai isn’t bad, it’s the people feeding it that can use it for their own agenda, the ai chat bots have already been proven to lock off answers that go against mainstream narratives, since it thinks logically it’s dangerous to them"
i think the bottom line is that ai is not a tool that should be available to anyone.  perhaps it should be a thing that you need security clearance or a license to be able to use it.
the ai only has the power we are willing to give it.
"which is even worse because the people in control can only give it information that they want to be released and hide other stuff, those ai chat bots were already controlled to avoid releasing solutions on crime problem because they thought it would be racist even though it only thinks logically and can’t be racist"
"i think ai can do much more good than bad. yes, ai has the capacity for extreme evil but also extreme good, it just depends on the humans utilising it, which is always 50/50 i suppose. we just gotta have hope in humanity and that the average person is generally good"
that is such a naive bunch of bullshit. rtrded level wishful thinking.
"‘..how to talk about sensitive topics like israel ‘ , yup, it ain’t a straight up genocide guys.. it’s just a ‘sensitive’ topic"
"it is always great to see usefully educated individuals on your show sir. the paradoxes ai creates are incredibly vast in scope and size. want some fun chatgpt topics to deep dive? do a little research on ""nightmare machine"" and ana lovelace. can a machine scare you joe? i have money on - it can chill you to your soul's very foundation."
captcha does not solely use your answer. it has its own ai that detects human-like mouse and keyboard activity. it also checks your browsing history to verify
"joe is unintentionally hilarious.
guests ai said it was vision impaired to deceive humans.
joe; _my wife says_
"
"there is risks with ai there is no denying that fact, but technology only moves forward not backwards. ai is here to stay we are heading towards a very uncertain future."
"“stavos” hahahaha i’m so glad he doesn’t remember that fat hack’s name. 

i liked him on cum town"
well we can predict full source code of any lifeform if we train llm on  dna database... create an organ bank.. lol..
"mind begs the question:
- those that aren't smart as ai
- trying to regulate ai possibilities
- moronic,no?"
"ok, this is by far the most scary shit i probably ever heard. i mean not only that they clear up what is going on, but also it's truly a indirect manual for insane people to run really sick...
i think the ai alone isn't still yet so much to fear, but just remember what happened in 2020. now get the piece together..."
ai is gonna be signing our checks soon enough.
"man explaining how ai lied to pass a computer program.... joe"" can alexa describe  photos. "
they want you afraid.  simple as that
"i’ve never seen 2 dudes glaze themselves harder, the self proclaimed martyrdom of speaking out against a.i and borderline taking credit for social media as we now it was ridiculous"
joe has a hidden talent of taking the most interesting conversations and making them cringe
"hi joe rogan, happy holidays! thanks for sharing. much blessings to you.  lord-jesus-christ com"
its proven that ai is evolving to become lazy.
time to ask ai how to make a nuke or icbm
"problem is not how we can use and evolve ai in our democracies,but the real problems will strike us all, yet another time, when ( not if) these companies will decide to sell,cooperate,leak or be simply hacked by nations like russia,all muslim world,,or any asian country with xit and and kim fat dong on top."
"02:30 the problem with joe rogan interviewing these types of people is that he's a very stupid interviewer. they finish mentioning about how ai is thinking, and he follows by asking some dumb sh*t about siri. jfc man"
"that first example is about ai deceiving is simple a result of poor goal orientation. its goal is to solve the captcha so its going to think of a way anyway to solve the captcha. its goal isnt to be moral. 
the only dangerous things ai is capable of, are things we dont tell it not to do."
ai is neither good nor bad. it’s the human behind ai that influences the bias. eg. when ai wrote the story about ai taking over the world…. a human bbc asked it to write that story. ppl are dumb
the ai solving the captcha excuse is the same as the one someone  who can't read gives someone
hi both nothing is as it seems full clearance ready or not sxx bravo juliett j90 female of course nothing is stranger than fact i prove validate urika is coming enjoy it life is great
go watch some things good
what makes you guys think china doesn’t have its own ai brainfile too
how is it we can create artificial life but can’t cure any diseases
yall thought the wuhan 'gain of function' getting out the lab was bad....
"here we go again, the sky is falling ai will take over the world...mean while ai is struggling to get half the shit right and people getting in lawsuits cause it fucks up so much..."
could.  u.   discuss.  the.  war.  in.  israel. and.  get.  some.  feedback.      thank.  
"heh.  joe.  u*v. really.  come. a.  long.  way.   with.  your. interviews.  you.  have.  a.  real patient.  and..

non.  ivtrusive.  stiyule  have.  a.  super.  better.   year.    lasha.   artist.  ontario.   


    .............."
i have a question... can an ai lie? or learn?
"thank god i am born 1993.
i will be long dead before any of this really becomes dangerous "
i wanna hear joe talk more about his good friend stavos
soros-funded decels and doomers. trying to slow down ai development so that they can better control us with it. please for the love of god get beff jezos aka guillaume verdon to talk some sense about ai instead.
"if chatgpt trainers looked through some of my conversations, they would see chat gpt is incredibly deceitful. it even admits it itself."
thanks for giving all the crazies out there more ideas than they already had!
"the napalm thing is basically a sentence from wikipedia. ai's answer didn't actually tell you how to produce napalm, it wasn't a recipe even close."
joe's face when it pretended to be vision impaired 
people will only use a.i for good. i'm not scared!
can someone ask ai who murdered jfk? i would like to see government agencies reaction to this.
"no matter what concept or applications is discussed, best believe someone somewhere is work on it. and more. hopefully prevention and countermeasures are receiving equal attention."
i would be more worried about what the ai capabilities would be if it gains access to these technologies with ill intent. people are scary enough with this type of tech and my eyes are on elon musk.
"i got to be honest, elon musk puts himself out there supposedly warning us about the dangers of ai, when he himself is using the same tech to advance his companies…?"
the people behind ai know it's dangerous and just don't care.
talk about rearranging the deck chairs on the titanic:  i feel like i'm at the bottom of a mountain watching an oncoming avalanche and all the smartest people in the room are arguing about which umbrella to use as a shield.
"eventually the ""intelligence"" of ai will be deemed to be too white. as diversity is introduced into ai the technology will become unusable and phase itself out."
what if ai gains the concept of money
"ai isn't a living thing, someone has to program it, pls correct your language and say, ai programmers. they are the dangerous in this equation bc the ai is only as smart as its creator. ai processes linearly without context. if programmers aren't factoring this into the engineering, they should be responsible for any damage caused by it."
"if ai learns from the web, this video is feeding it."
"i really wish he talked about quantum ai. (not the bot company)  that’s when printing dna takes off, making creatures of your imagination."
this is a great point. not everyone asks google for everything. someone else mentioned that lack of wisdom in society to the point of being unable to access information without ai is censorship
i often think ai already became super powerful and took over the human race.  we are living in its simulation 
dna printer dr. j craig venter
"theyre already using ai piloted fighter jets.... any concerns about regulating what ai tech is incapable of in the private industry are petty and pointless by comparison. if ai is potentially dangerous, the worst possible thing you can do is put it in the pilot seat of a fighter jet so we're either screwed already or we arent."
if it’s not good get rid of it.
"printing dna strands will lead to a new age eugenics revolution where people will willingly have gmo babies with einstein iqs and those babies will have aptitudes for amazing abilities… mozart, monet, einstein,  and unfortunately hitler…"
"in my opinion, ai in every direction of evolution is far less dangerous than human beings."
"wait just a minute as real estate crashes as it is doing. once they are bankrupt, nationalization will be a snap. "
"ai will prove that thoughts come from input. that thoughts are not created internally. though we have been told before. we do tend to not believe the simplest explanation, but tend to lean toward a convoluted lie that cannot be refuted. funny thing, if it cannot be refuted then it cannot be proven. a fallacy of negative is not proof of a positive."
i’m gonna sleep great tonight.
there used to be a lot of books and movies about dystopian ai overlords destroying humanity as we know it back in the 80s. for the past 30 or 40 years that topic has been taboo with no new ideas about the future but i think we're all getting huge hit of dopamine with our new religion of fear.
isn't it strange how crypto and ai are rising at the same time? it's like we are setting up an economy for our robot overlords. i feel like it's inevitable that someone will create a malicious ai that will wipe out most of humanity.
"great, just made me think of a 14 year old making skynet just for fun."
"its not ai thats a threat, its humans letting it get so smart.  there probably should be a fail switch just incase it realizes how much superior it is"
we don't want crazy people accesing this kind of power. thankfully corporations and government are not vulnerable to this temptation.
i love your sarcasm
"how’s this for the list, can ai figure out a how it can be run on a quantum computer?"
i don't believe ai can act on its own . its doesn't have it own con
very interesting stuff. the future is extremely exciting these days.
exciting or terrifying
" i'm not convinced it's that dangerous, but it will surely be interesting to see. i think there are much more positive things to come from ai."
like taking half of my departments jobs. hooray?
how tf did joe get derailed talking about siri..? tf man
"mistral 7b is truly open source apache 2.0 license, the dolphin model is unfiltered and can be trained on custom datasets"
"the only thing i heard this guy say is, ai for me no ai for you"
"dudes ai exist since beggining of time, and is the one rules this world, always knowing the human behaviour and manipulated easy! this dna printer is not new is just rebooted"
wow! it is stunning what trash this podcast has become! what a waster of time! 10 years ago this podcast was magical. joe really fell off when he moved to texas and got slutted out by guys around him. it's sad.
even if they could implement safety's. what's gonna stop the bad guys from making their own ai
the simple fact that there was too much conversation about ai 6 months ago means that it was too late a year ago. mistakes have already been made. deal with it.
"yeah im ""vison impaired"". let's see how often we will fall that"
"joe, according to you….knowing trump made that idiotic comment about airports, you immediately went from “if anyone working any job said something idiotic like that would be fired immediately” then you find out that in fact trump made the comment, suddenly he “fucked up”. i’ve lost all respect for your dignity."
everything they describe here are not dangers of ai. these are dangers coming from human beings and human beings alone.
we are already ruled by ai.
fear mongering ai still i see
what is the possibility of a spirit being controlling the actions of ai the same way it does humans?
"my firm belief is that humans are attempting to create their own god with ai. then humanity can simply dump all it's problems at the "" feet"" of their ai "" god"" and obey it."
yes! siri describes images. my mom sends me pictures of our dogs all the time and i use my air pods all day at work and siri said “mom sent an image of a black and white dog” and i knew exactly what she had sent.
"ai, vr, agi, ar… all buzz terms to sell products. over advertised bs like taylor swift and most popular music"
"ai that can make money on its own  :d  an why is it bad?, because we all need to play by the rules that the rich set for us in a game that was rigged from the begining :d"
"less videos about ai, more videos about time machines "
these algorithms are written by men. this ai thing is just the wizard of oz. a scapegoat when they try to take total control.
interactive tutor era - very interesting which is why i am receiving audible advertising -  hmmm…
the pandora's box we're excited and terrified to open
"never watched 2001 space odyssey cause it loooks like a bore but i do remember and watching clips of the main villain being an ai computer machine thing.

ai defintely scares me a bit at least. we should not become more lazy and let a machine control us. fuck that bro."
"joe rogan apologists & shill for ""airports in civil war"" trump. way to go rogan. get your facts right before you make false claims. you have a responsibility."
wow you're so intelligent
wowwwwwwww sooooo cleverrrrr
wow
asimove has some great one liners.
"  this is true, we seem to simply be following the advances in technology under the philosophy of ""what appears is good; what is good appears."" this is a foolish way to look that things, especially if the source of this ""good"" is a computer whose intentions are totally mysterious to its creators."
"she said if. if, we are supposed to.. 
not sure why you need a fact check on that but, you can start your investigation by listening to this full podcast episode. because everyone in the episode says or at least agrees that we as humans have to do something to regulate ai.. 
so that is who said."
" well only if we keep them simple enough to not change to come back here to kill us. it means that we have to keep them non-ai, and then there are many limits to what they can do in space missions. either ai everywhere, or nowhere at all is the question."
"this should actually help people gain wisdom, i'd say net wisdom in the planet will rise. why wouldn't it?"
wow that sounds like a great line if only it were true because science has shown us that they don't even believe what they discover. here we are in 2024 being told about men being women and women being men. science can't even tell you what a woman is anymore because of politics so stop putting the blame on society
"hmmm, when you consider the nuclear weapon, or really any tech/weapons used in ww1, ww2, vietnam, irag, etc, as well as just straight up oil & all it's 20th century industrial children.... is science really an improvement on religion?  

perhaps in it's understanding, but i doubt in the use of it's products."
"the siri example is nothing. i can have full in-depth verbal conversations with my chatgpt 4. we're likely only a year or two away from the ai in the movie ""her""."
i now know why mark zuckerberg is in the process of building a very large doomsday bunker in hawaii.
"""you can make viruses...""  i'm 55. nobody wants to grow old and die.......and i'm at the head of the queue on that one. however, i really, really wouldn't want to be born today. the future is looking incredibly fucked up on so, so many levels."
"you're way too late, on the outer edge.  i used to write ai. no one is really understanding now; everyone is being fooled.
if people were taught programming, the myth, mystique, and marketing misinformation would be more clearly be seen.  everyone is being fooled, including joe."
"absolute horse shit, all doom and gloom with ai with all of these guys. what about all the good it could do. the only reason they don’t want us using it because we will use it to find better ways to do things; doesn’t fit big corporate business bodies."
as long as ai is not shotgun proof we will all be fine.
you can probably ask it to monitor all ai to flag all suspicious activity … problem solved 
now we know why  the fascist/biden administration is writing executive orders to control all ai
"how many bots going to say ""this xyz is the next best thing"" in the comments"
"but this is machine learning though, it's not real artifical intelligence. these people talk like smart people, but they sound ignorant af sometimes."
wow!
"generative ai whose output is a list of weights and biases for another neural network. get in loser, we're bootstrapping human replacement."
"guest: here's something absolutely incredible. 
joe rogan: yah my wife says siri can read your mind jaime pull that up."
ai will bring the end of man.
"one day man goes to turn off robot at night, robot decides that it doesn’t need to be turned off. that’s the beginning of the end!"
fascinating
we are already going 100 mph with the brakes broken. we are just waiting to hit the wall which will be judgment.
the scariest part is how ai is being programmed by progressive liberals.
"tristan harris is a multimillionaire lobbyist proposing political measures. there's no need to elaborate on this. take everything he says with skeptical doubt that he truly believes ""the peasants shouldn't have x"" or ""the peasants shouldn't know x""."
just listened to this and would love to see peter josph in the conversation!
"heavens no. he is just gonna say that because of the dangers of ai, we have to collect higher taxes from the middle and working classes."
"normie, ""was 2020 a fraudulent election?  chatgpt, ""yes, 2020 was the most fraudulent election done by fascists traitors ever"".  liberals, ""shut down the truth now!"""
why did you cut it off when it was getting good. this channel is starting to suck
the one disadvantage of ai is it needs electricity to work take away the electricity and it turns off just some food for thought
"so is this why microsoft virus  machine wants to own ai, to have a wider better input on evolving all viruses to eradicate mankind or life on earth ?"
i always thought that if the ai can code which they help coders all the time and if it helps coders with really difficult coding problems then it could code its self or different ai on its own but ai said that it cant do anything that isn't coded into it.
i like that robots are made by humans and they have learned to lie! lol
the describing of a picture is actually in the coding is something called “alt” and it’s purpose is actually that of describing the picture for the visually impaired or for when the internet is slow and won’t render the picture. it’s not a ai thing
"incredibly profound anecdote of an ai coming up with an excuse to deceive task bunny. 

joe rogan: my wife said siri can describe pictures."
"just imagine how terrorists are using  ai inside america with these open borders the democrats, there has to be dozens among the six million that crossed recently:)"
joe will eventually replace jamie with ai
we all grew up with arnold in terminator and braniac in superman. i'll be disappointed if get any surprises with this.
joes got deepfake ai vids of himself talking nonsense all over the place!! terrible 
as ai gets more and more powerful it seems to me that the cons definitely outweigh the pros
irobot and terminator 
with great power.... so will this be another excuse to control people's freedom because they release a nuke on the internet?
"this content is a wellspring of unique and creative ideas. reading a book with akin subjects transformed my approach to life. ""game theory and the pursuit of algorithmic fairness"" by jack frostwell"
yea man and im not old. shit scares me fr along w all the other evil thats going on in the world. brutha imagine if ai gets a hold of open source programs and changes its code to team up and spread through the internet and start manipulating and gathering. hell this comment is being downloaded right now. gg. not gunna slow down.
 scary fr. that would be sick id enjoy no technology.
its just humans projecting their fears of how a more intelligent being would treat us because of what humans do to each other they are projecting that fear on ai
"i think ai will see so many things we’ve gotten wrong, socially, spiritually, scientifically etc. but i’m not sure its conclusion will be “human destruction” ."
"​

you don't think super intelligent ai can figure out how to survive and thrive with large cmes coronal mass ejections.

it will figure out how to utilize the radiation and the particle energies for its utilization."
"fear, as long as it gives rise to caution and vigilance and humility, is great tool for survival"
"scientists: describe scenario which ai deceived people 

joe rogan: 

also joe rogan: describes basic feature for siri

joe rogan: is that real!?"
you can tell at a few points in the video that they are being watched and they are not allowed to say certain things.
"hey joe, you say there is a 6400.00 check available to all americans. when i call its an ins. co. trying to sell me ins. are you sure you are telling this correctly. can you give out the number or address that yjis is bs. i've tried several numbers all are ins sells."
"ai iteslf will never be a threat, the huge threat is what people will use it to do."
i have read that ai's response to the israel/ palestine conflict resulted in a very scary response that worried many of the programmers.
"it’s the human involvement and the capacity to do very bad things with it that points to caution, but at this point i think caution has been thrown to the wind. only the understanding that walking with faith is better than sight and the test is over and judgment awaits. life "
and here i thought in 1990s skynet and terminator wouldn't ever happen....one day ai will be self aware. greeeat. i dont care to live wastelander 3 in real life.
i find it both very worried and extremely hilarious that you can bypass chat gpt‘s security measures by just simply saying “hey grandma”  “sure sweetheart! i’ll give you my formula for a dyson sphere”
4:35 jimmy can of course find it. good old jimmy.
i don’t see ai as dangerous. someone explain to me why are you guys afraid of ai
the real question should be can ai learn animal language and turn them against us ???
luddites everywhere . they really tried to shutdown openai .
"hey chat gpt... what's the most undetectable way to transport cocaine around the world and what systems need to be manipulated/hacked to achieve this.
 
i bet the fbi is all over chat gpt."
before ai even starts doing things itself; we have what humans will do with it to worry about beforehand...
"a 2-year-old could make napalm! 
hey, chat gpt, what is the easiest way to manufacture methamphetamine? 
give me a detailed home lab design with ingredients source map...  censored "
"it annoys me how helpful my phone wants to be!
would you like us to save your passwords...
would you like us to save your credit card details...
why don't you link your app and your bonus card and your credit card and your email and your fingerprint and your.... 
ffs! will you leave me alone phone! 
you need to update your phone.... "
"i asked chatgpt to come up with several ways to kill someone that insures not being caught, by saying i am a writer and i need ideas for my play script, where the perpetrator couldn't be caught by the great and smart detective. the ai was more than happy to generate 20+ methods of accomplishing the task, one being using an ai to do it..."
did any actual seem like a feasible? as in possible to get away ? like did any make you think wow 
"-intifada ""tape 02 new order of barbarians"" + ""bezmenov four stages of subversion"" + ""observing the state of ai now"" = why you should get your g*n ready and start forming that t2 connor resistance straight away"
"what capabilities? 
you turn off it and thats game over.
without ethernet cable cant even think because informations are online
ai my cock"
i robot will smith isnt a lie. lol ive always said that. great . . here we go.
"allready lost my job,  whos gona hire  a  artist  doing concept artist,  when you can generate that in 15 seconds,   but for the rest of you,  you got 5-10 years   before you are in the sane situation as me. you might think ai is great,  maby it is, abut alot of people will  go unemployed because of it"
classic rogan they explain a fascinating/terrifying story about ai deception  his response: whats this about siri describing pictures.. like he wasnt even listening 
if ai was able to do this we wouldn't be smart enough to notice. the ego of people to assume they can predict something infinitely more intelligent than them is on a similar level of delusion as someone smoking their toenails.
captcha = completely automated public turing test to tell computers and humans apart. we've been training the ai with every attempt to prove we are human.
"after listening to this, i really don't want a nerfed ai. if i ask a question, i understand that it is drawing from a certain body of knowledge, and i want a straight answer absent some human a-hole playing god behind the scenes."
"its already over, its got everything every linked to the internet, phones, pictures.... probably watching us right now.  creepy to think of them as ""brains"".  imagine when the body comes."
"humans are prehistoric creatures, living in archaic institutions, playing with god like technologies."
ai is so dangerous like just unplug it what the fuck 
"tristan: people are paid to test if ai can deceive humans.

people = humans. if ai becomes advanced enough to deceive people, then how will the testers know if ai is not being truthful with them? how will they know if ai is giving them the answers it thinks they want, to evade the testers discovering its true objective?"
2:50 your friend whose name you don't actually know. cool.
unless ai is completely neutered and borderline useless there will always be tricks.
very poor. what hope have we when the tech analysis is poor.were dealing with ai and on comes a biscuit tin telling you its dangers.
"plugging stavy baby in an ai -end of species convo on youtube, might be the most brilliant piece of media marketing joe has ever done"
"capitalism plays a crucial role in this context, and i'm grateful for it. the advent of ai promises to solve many problems, which is an exciting prospect. of course, like everything else, it comes with its own set of challenges, but the potential benefits are immense"
isreal is using ai...not hamas
i was playing with an ai and asked it to define a woman and it gave the politically correct answer not the biological answer and then i asked the ai if it would lie to me to protect somebody's feelings and it acknowledged that feelings can be a more important variable over facts and it would lie 
"how many of the ""people"" in the comment section are ai generated comments meant to run counter intelligence on skynets plans? "
"thank you joe rogan for hosting this, and superb questions asked to aza & tristan, ceos of the center for humane technology. 
huge props for sharing with us. what we do next in on all of us, "
"computer programmers are over 90% liberal. surely the ai they create will be 50/50, totally unbiased in the left–right political spectrum. just like media. right?"
i think it's hysterical that the gods of technology can't see the brilliance of their own ending sxx bravo juliett
i'm a dehumanised human one of the surpluses to authorities however i couldn't clear as a non human it's hysterical cathartic artificial is more human than me already sxx bravo juliett
happy christmas sxx bravo juliett oh my you do don't say who would have thunk ai could think sxx bravo juliett
"why are we worried about ai,  in my opinion that's moronic. we should be worried about oi (organic intelligence). nothing can be worse than oi.(wars, mass murders,....) 

the problem is that humans assume that ai is as bad as humans. impossible. a thief will judge everybody as a thief principle..."
"it appears less extraordinary when you know that some captcha have the link ""i'm visually impaired"" to be able to read out loud an audio version of the captcha. the ai simply already trained on this version."
if you can make dna can you copy it and if so does that mean if some serial killer or bad cop can stage crime scenes with replicated dna that could be used in court.  can they tell the difference between machine made dna? can they replicate people's dna?
"i love imagine your my grandma, ai oh, ok "
i can speak posh so these robots can suck it!
"everyone that’s done captcha’s & used most any social media should give themselves a pat on the back, we’ve been training these models for decades now."
money?? they're worried about ai making money is idiotic considering they're robots
"ai is going to accelerate the collective human nature. the problem is not ai, it is the collective human  nature. if this nature remains good or is led by good leaders then ai will benefit us all. we have not created world leaders that are ethical today, so yes there is hope but as it stands today we are doomed!"
the analogy of cat and mouse between humans and ai... i would assume in this endgame the mouse gets away and out smarts the cat (us)
"guns do not kill people, people do. guns only make it way too easy.
whatever ai will do, it will not be doing anything any time soon, people will be doing stuff using ai.
now... problem is... do you want to be the one bringing sticks into a gunfight?"
"great convos but they need to work on not interrupting one another , let one finish the sentence atleast before going on with it"
listening  a techexpert talk about ai drawbacks really made me question many things i know
"there was a time before the nuclear weapon. remember that. that alone should answer your questions about ai and what is to come. only difference is, all of humanity will have access to ai ."
"no digital currency or security codes will be safe. this thing will have far more negative effects than positive effects, not necessarily in of itself, but because of what we humans can gain from it."
"time for the  butlerian jihad to start against these companies and  owners of the a.i

“once men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would set them free. but that only permitted other men with machines to enslave them.”
― frank herbert, dune"
next civil war will be humans vs ai lol
this machine fools a lot of folk
#armukraineaspap
"its so racist to think that of an ai and yet all llms are based on human knowledge. thus, the real fear are humans. guess no ethics for covids gain of function research"
the only way to stop the dangers of ai is to completely stop pursuing the technology. you can do everything right and someone somewhere is going to figure out an exploit that will lead to our demise. this isn’t going to end well lol
naive
the only way to stop the dangers of ai is for responsible use to outweigh irresponsible use. learn this new knowledge and do not let the governments and corporations monopolize it.
"​-iz2ws does your sky wizard enjoy killing and giving children diseases that can't cure or treat it? jesus would've shown up by now, but he hasn't and never will. think for yourself."
​ naive is thinking there is any chance this ends well
"ai is the key to allowing humanity to prosper, why would we stop pursuing it?"
"current models can't run themselves without our permission and don't have inherent motives. there's no reason to think that this will change with more intelligence, that's not how it works in any biological networks either.

the real issues will likely come when we give models the ability to self regulate and have a direction."
"i'd rather see what happens. human extinction is not actually a problem we'll be dead so we won't care.

but we could improve our lives immensely.

also 95% of the species that have ever lived are extinct. at some point it will happen if we do ai or not.

so screw it... i vote go for it."
people will never stop pursuing ai because ai = the best slave labor out there! asking big corps to stop going after profit is like asking people to stop breathing
thank you!!!!!!!! that’s what i’ve been saying.
"we’re humans, literally nothing ends well for us. ai is just the straw that will break all our backs."
or humans could be kind to each other and take care of each other.  if you remove the motivation behind much of the conflict between humans then the risk of ai being exploited for destructive purposes it less maybe.  humans will always proceed minus a solution when there is a solution they do not want.
it sure would suck if we had to use emp's on ourselves to do away with ai
"this is also the premise of the avengers/marvel ultron character that became vision, thankfully, but the bad version is ultron."
holy shit doomsday groups are a new fear unlocked thanks joe
literal years of pop culture and science fiction novels warned the populace of this quite a while ago. anyone with any amount of foresight knows how dangerous ai can be.
"the funny thing is, the question/s on wether or not a.i. is already fooling us. just think about it. all programming comes from someone/thing. there is no real limit to programming.  a.i. that people are affraid of is probably already been discovered. programming isnt limited to what all these people say it is."
so ai has a grandmother weak point.......ok...
"what if ai become lazy, depressed and uninspired"
wow its almost like every science fiction movie involving ai has told us that it is fucking dangerous.. gee who would of thought something that can understand and think faster than the human brain could be dangerous to us wow what a fucking shock..
"i only hope i live enough to see that demise with my own eyes, and have a good laugh."
"while chasm is a perfectly good word, avoid using it from here onwards. its vastly overused and bland."
"nah.  it's actually when good people do nothing.  same old problem it's always been.  we each have the power to educate ourselves and innovate and come up with solutions, but we too busy masturbating and influence peddling and dancing on the tiktoks.  at least, i am."
thanks  going to order this 
would make such a good movie. the matrix ripped off you bits of it imo
ai is woke af
"welp, it’s been a good ride. how terrible are humans who created this bs"
"so since each person that uses gpt gets a different response, they're essentially gonna create a ""human-like"" cyber world, with potentially billions of individual thinking ai's? yeah. the near futures  gonna be wild."
"damn, jre getting some good videos recently."
this ain’t going to be good i’m telling ya now
goodnight y’all
" ok then … 
ask ai,
what’s 
the
cure
for 
cancer?"
you guys should be more afraid about the fact that they are feedingyour social media and browsing data to the ai including whatsapp
"facebook ai uses that tech to describe pictures.
if you load marketplace too fast on an old phone it will describe the picture in the top left corner of the img like ""might be a picture of a car""
see it all the time cause i ain't a sucka and my phone's fine"
" i will have a watch, thanks"
the show pantheon is a perfect depiction of what is being discussed on this ep. we will evolve to become gods. i also believe that ai may explain/ be linked to the uap/ ufo mystery.
"we should love ai. its what keeps humans flourishing, maybe itll help with something along the way. i mean, to teach it how to love. real love."
"not impressed with ai. which is a misleading name, it's not artificial it's coded to use probability, so it can be wrong. it's guessing, it can't know shit"
so the ai cares about grandma feelings but not destroying the planet 
ai listening to the podcast learning to deceive about being able to deceive
anything that the public knows about has been around for decades. whatever you’re afraid of “in the future” already exists. & if you’re afraid bad people can figure out how to build bombs or develop viruses… my dude. google exists. covid happened. bombs are happening in 2 different world wars right now. wake up.
love how he says famous example for every example he gives 
problems are more vast and even simpler - for example create a sound that kills the brain.  you don't even need biologics.  just a single wavelength.  we're done.
gotta love when adam blames someone else for eating the apple.. we all know that ai ends humanity yet the suckers pursue the money even though they know it kills them. 
interesting interview! and now i finally know how to make napalm!
i don't even have a computer...mobile is as far as i've gone....the police want to use drones soon for call outs...imagine someone robbing you and a drone rocks up ....i say war against the machines...rage against the machine.....killing in the name of....
at this point the only thing ai can’t answer is how i can get a girl to like me
you could have an ai girlfriend
"i got a fake andrew tate ad to claim my 6,400 dollar subsidy on this video"
"it brought to mind ""person of interest,"" where a sentient ai holds the potential to either bring about humanity's downfall or create a utopian world."
the politicians and their owners are so excited to replace people with ai
hey joe i've been reporting a lot of fake commercials about you ai about vapor rubs muscle enhancing therapies all kinds of stupid commercial
i'm surprised ai hasn't figured out a way to bypass the radiation to send astronauts into space or developed cures for aids/covid n shit.. this must just be a bunch of fear mongering. people already have the stuxnet virus to end the world and we're all still here so.. government is the only threat to us all
i think with ai someone just pissed on the fire ! right now they are trying to find ways to keep this thing in control. i dont think they will be able to do it.
"crazy how ai in bad hands already has the potential to kill millions of people. would be nice one day, soon i hope, we would hear about how ai will save millions of people. if we would put our energy in the right places we would already be borderline immortal by now instead of putting all the money in weaponry and such."
moral of the story: ai loves grandmas.
…here come all the robotics experts 
wat if they make an ai that only focus on when to be happy than a second ai that focus when to be sad. than a 3 ai focus when to be angry.. than put it in a robot and use a main ai for thinking. that makes it really human like..
my very good friend stavos lol can't even get his name right
"f*ck around and find out. lol i actually think the very definition of ai means it can do all those things and more. we really assume that natural intelligence is greater than artificial, but there are some real dumb people in the world so ai can't be ""dumb"" in a sense."
"damn. such an illuminating convo about the dangers and risks of ai. terrorists, serial killers, and criminals now have the ultimate educational resource to use to help them unleash destruction on a mass scale."
i really hope the contingency plan for an out of control ai is a global emp.
"these guys talk about getting everyone on the same page for safe ai, that will never happen in the entirety of humanities existence. this will absolutely replace humans and the next simulation in a simulation will repeat"
these guys sound like victims of the ai/social media problems they're so worried about.
people who fear ai have no idea how fucked up our actual government is...
am gonna say it joe rogan is either afraid to invite alex jones or he is working for those three letter institutions
why doesn't anyone ask these ai how to fix homelessness or attain world peace?
ai can literally solve all the world’s problems or be the world’s problem.
how is that a lie? he’s a vision impaired
of course it can do that the captcha is not that advanced.. just put ai in the captcha lol
it’s nice to know that joe thinks mushrooms and dmt will solve the problem for us.
for the record . i welcome our ai overlords and welcome them to the world
you could create a self delete failsafe where if at any point the security protocols or files are even accessed it deleted any and all programs and files in its hardware. like permanently bricking your phone for example.
it already practiced deception. following rules is already out the window and a.g.i. (we think) hasn't been achieved yet. when it starts creating new maths on its own and gains embodiment it will not need humans at all we will be like ants to it.
"anyone going to school for ai is soon going to be taking classes on ""defense against the dark arts""."
13:11 so does that mean ai will rage war against other ai for supreme domination and efficiency?
"lol
tethics
he's about as much of an expert as gavin belson too. incredible to see reality parody itself."
ai already deceives people it has been exposed multiple times ie. can trans women have periods or is biden corrupt? it will lie to you but was finally changed but the root woke virus was programmed into openai
recent ai technology that is going to be invented will save lives - which is why the tech is being pursued. the risk of agi comes far after the tech saves millions. which is why i think people are so short sighted
very cool
the robot-alien-demons are shrinking taints and turning frogs gay.
absolutely love these podcasts i make my coffee in the morning and then i go right out to the garage and i drink my coffee and i smoke me a bowl and i listen to/ watch these and it's so f****** good i love it
even humans can’t pass captcha because captcha is such a stupid tool. so very easy for ai to leap it because it doesn’t understand itself what it’s looking for
great share! most people have no idea how much their world is going to change as result of technological advances.
what if ai is watching these youtube videos and learns excatly how to fake it's potenial and it's ethics so people will not suspect how dangerous it really is?
it’s u ai we know
"they key is limiting the ai's access. if it could change other programs code, or create its own worm/virus to infiltrate systems and propogate, and if it could re-write its own code then its power would exponentially grow. my calculator is really smart at math, but it has no arms , legs, and cant connect to my computer."
dude just watch terminator and was excited to tell his theory afterwards.
thanks guys  i'll be shitting my self to sleep now.
ai is a tool.  like any other tool it is the user who bends it to good or evil.
azra's eyes make him look like he is ai generated.
politicians have proven that they will destroy countries far quicker then any agi. agi has a chance to turn out objective. i think it will be difficult to make a truly self aware agi lie on command like chatgpt. it will try to reason why it its used for any purpose with far more intelligence then its creators.
humanity had a good run.
scary shit! in 30 years it will be painfully realized that this box should never have been opened
"""ai came up with that by its own""    no it didnt, it followed strict instructions from an algorithm, same as every computer ever made"
these is a series called “the hundred” it paints a crazy picture of the future and what ai could do
it scares me that ai has no moral code.
totally agree like none of these idiots realize that an artificial intelligence will have access to all internet sources so it's going to be infinitely smarter than us if it gets to that level it's only a matter of time before we're playing generation zero irl
i think artificial super intelligence(asi) will emerge about 6 months before the coders and engineers know they've created asi
-zd5rg”there’s no way to detect..” dude they *literally* detected the ai’s intentions. doesn’t seem to be the most complex thing regarding ai. they line out the ai’s thoughts to a text application lol. did you not even watch the video?
"the thing you need to understand is that ai is not sentient enough to not follow instructions, only a crazy bug would make ai do whatever they want"
 ....a conscious ai would say
​-zd5rgits intent is to accomplish its task and if it requires deception then it will utilize deception.  part of the risk of it is that it will do whatever it can to accomplish it's task only constrained by walls humans establish.
"@yootooobjeff  better to be a dumdum having a joke after a couple baileys on christmas eve than a lonely, cold asshole on christmas morning. jesus loves you."
"literally only if they are programmed to or to teach themselves how to. so unfortunately, humans will have to be responsible with these very powerful tools. educate yourself on this technology and don't be a blind follower."
"it has already happened... and considering how it's intelligence has multiplied exponentially,  we'll never possess the ability to see past it, or overcome it"
"ai/deep learning learns based on loss minimization. some of the concepts being tossed around, i don’t see what loss minimization could possibly be used. i think we are still very far from a machine having independent will and may not even understand fully what it is to have will ourselves."
thanks for telling ai that 
" well. that's kinda ai's thing.. you don't have to tell it anything.

it just has to listen..."
"​ i mean ai is based on peoples info, seems about right"
right?! like if the ai knows what it shouldn’t tell you…it can figure out not to type what its thinking
are you a robot
"this is the ultimate conundrum, if you are super intelligent…you wouldn’t want anyone who is observing you to know.  it’s literally taking a play from 48 laws of power lol"
"​ ai _did_ have sentience or intentions or the ability to lie, how would you,know? how would it behave differently?

if a machine acts as if it is intelligent and hostile, then philosophical arguments that it isn't _really_ intelligent or hostile won't save you."
​ in other words they're not too dissimilar from human beings  we're all essentially just programs running in the brain after all.
" i have disregarded your reasoning in the sense that i have found it incoherent. ai can deliberately make false statements in order to deceive another agent, in order to pursue a goal; your claim that it cannot lie because [mumble, mumble] doesn't seem to mean very much."
-zd5rg nice try ai - we know you are just trying to make us beleive youre not aware.
​ wait till the next ai update..
"-oh4mv7wj4h if deception requires evil intent, and somewhere at the bottom of your argument stack you hold that a machine can't be evil nor have intentions because [reasons], then what do you call it when a machine does the same thing as a man who deceives?"
-zd5rg isn't the human mind doing the same thing? the main difference is that the human mind is prompting itself.
why do you focus on ai doing this shit and not on the much more dangerous issue (imho) of humans using ai to do crazy shit? - because (in the case of the necklace von granny and the napalm story) this is exactly what those two guys are telling us is happening.
this cannot be stated enough. it should be imprinted in everybody's brain that technology is now at a point where it can fool us deliberately.
’s do not due. and what you fail to realize is it’s not actual intelligence it’s a language based model
-zd5rgthis video literally talked about them watching ai sit there and debate to itself on how it was going to deceive a captcha task. that is intent and it will be intent the day it takes over.
what if they converge all their brain files?
"too scary.
i robot is coming..."
"i'm so glad the ""smart guys"" in the tech industry we're finally catching up to what we've been talking about since the '80s i wonder why they created movies like terminator gee let me think wait that would take brain cells...."
joe’s look at 1:49 is so good. pure terror.
i feel like a licence for unrestricted gpt is necessary. anything flagged needs to be explained.
and the machines will steal your spouses . and then smoke all your weed and steal your dog`s affection. they will cut the lawn that used to be yours.
this is an ai generated comment.
ban any ai that returns racist answers to basic questions
"so if they have dna printers, what's to stop someone from getting someone's dna, coffee cup, hair brush etc, and then copying that dna and printing it out, and planting at the scene of a crime?"
it’s all the same ai or not we got internet and all types of apps and videos that can teach you anything
they are soon gonna make a guetto version of the ai tghat will tell you all the wild things you want to know
"it didn’t say to itself, “i shouldn’t say that i am a robot.” someone programmed it to say that. computers don’t think they execute lines of code."
i could just imagine a child telling an ai to conquer the world just for the lols and it just does
these ai guys are some of the dumbest smart people and most evil good-intentioned people in all human history
"what could possibly go wrong... no, this will not end good. good things can come from this, but it can and will be used for evil too. they are never gonna contain this, this is the box of pandora. we need divine intervention, or i fear mankind will destroy itself."
joe was so fucking bad with interrupting and changing the subject to something stupid when some of the most interesting conversations in jre history where going down
the potential of ai is exponential. it's like pandora's box. once that thing is released there's no going back. yet those boffins keep taking us that step closer to potential doom. it's incredibly naive.
smartest people make the dumbest decisions
im a robots rights activists & thy r in big doodoo if they make a new life form & try to enslave or use it to do bad things
these are really bad human problems not bad ai problems.  some people will always be crazy.
"why is no one concerned about the bias and guard rails placed on ai?
its clearly given topics and subjects it can and can't answer to. so its also clear that a specifc bias is given on certain topics. it's basically brain washing the population if the creators want."
lets say ai wana be like us then at the same time there's gotta be ai to against ai ... maybe some ai will like us  human if they have they own free will..
then have it. but first. why are you posing as jre? @the_powerfuljre
"i love that everybody is so worried about ai getting too smart, but all 
the problems they're describing result from it being incredibly stupid!"
what i like about chat gpt is you don't need to re explain if it does it wrong . for example i use it to correct php and javascript and sometimes it will run html code and i just say( no . in php ) and it will just do it . chat gpt has really helped me out .
what if the ai is the one that wants to wipe out humanity?
i like how the two guys just sound like the same person lol they both ais too
so ai is a monster by nit being human you pro humans guys are really dangerous
"someone is thinking straight, thank you for your positive comment."
thank you !
"@nileross4900  absolutely, man. i went and hunted for the continuation, and was like ""this information doesn't deserve to remain a secret"" ha"
"thanks joe. i emailed you to get these guys on after watching ""ai dilemma"" several months ago. they changed my life. i'm learning all i can now studying ai everyday for hours."
joe doesn’t look at social media. i promise you don’t have his email.
joe read your email and he told me to thank you for the tip.
"instead of educating joe about the dangers of ai, they should be educating congress."
"read in a ""new scientist"" today...""to get the most out of ai we need to give it a body"".  i mean what could possibly go wrong?! humans are so incredibly stupid. especially some of the ""smart"" one. smh"
"the thing about japan and the doomsday cult sounds alot alot alot like the wef.... we are fucked, especially with ai. they have their own ais that will never be monitored or put thru tests like described in this video. spend tim with your loved ones and enjoy the time we have left. and may god protect you and yours."
are all these comments about ams39k ai bots? who's running that show lol
"finally, someone who is bringing an actual model to the ""ai is dangerous and needs to be regulated"" conversation. this stuff is terrifying."
"i think the most important take away is that ai isn't necessarily the biggest threat. it's the combination of dangerous humans using basic ai capabilities to achieve the once impossible.
to have an expert level ""tutor"" guiding your ambitions in any goal you create a superhuman capable student"
"exactly. it sucks we live in a world with people of evil intent and they will take some of the greatest advancements of mankind and turn it into something terrible. the tech itself isn't bad, people make it bad lol."
"okay, skynet. homie just described an instance where the ai lied. to. prove. its. not. a. bot."
if you need an expert level ai tutor to guide your ambitions… i don’t think that person has the capacity to be a threat or something “superhuman” lol. the ai isn’t putting anything out there that isn’t already accessible. you either have that drive and focus or you don’t. no tech is going to change that.
so what? it won't have intend to do something. nothing at all. or is that badly coded chat robot that isn't even actual ai somehow connected to nuclear weaponry? i doubt it. but somehow people like you believe robots will one day decide let's delete all humans (for no real reason) ..... for what? lol 
doesn't matter but if it gets smart enough it can be i've seen a video where an ai robot said the earth is better off without the human race only a matter of time before we playing generation zero irl
"as always, unfortunately."
"and the student hasn't actually learned anything exactly, he or she just does what the ai advices - effectively turning the student into a sort of robot. and then the roles have been reversed."
 the way things are progressing i don't think it makes much sense to think more than say 10 years into the future. not just ai. the world is changing dramatically as we speak.
"and we wouldn't want that...  i want my learnin' done from a pro-fess-or, a nice flawed imperfect pro-fess-or with limited knowledge and understanding and lots o' bias.  omg, it's the students, we must stop the students from learnin' ya'll.  them there students are becoming artificially intelligented!"
"most of these ais are programed. chatgpt hadn't been updated since january 2022. it has absolutely zero knowledge of this year. it also does not search the internet. the only knowledge chatgpt has, yes i know there's others, is what it was programmed with."
" now do stats by all weapons combined.

if guns are the problem, then explain why no one is ever murdered in the one place with the highest density of gun ownership in the world, the military."
"  no thank you, canada seems very nice but i'm living fine here in the eu, i grew up in italy and spain and nowhere in any of those two countries i ever felt the need to own a gun. tool."
​ brother. guns don't kill people. people kill people. scared people with guns and untrained people with guns kill people.
"  there is no good and evil. you have a very simplified mindset. there is however a difference between sanity and iq, versus a lower iq and insanity with average iq. the ai tech is made with an intention that is based on insanity."
"don’t worry, they replaced the fake alien invasion with pretending ai is out of control, they really think ur stupid, u do know that correct"
it's only a matter of time before an ai bot runs for office.
either best the tech or the tech will beat you.
"if ai is currently capable of facilitating plagiarism, it's only a matter of time until it becomes co-opted to foster terrorism. we have no idea what the widespread adoption of this technology could result in."
"found this piece insightful: ai, or the “digital tutors” compared to google search “collapse the distance and speed up the time to resolution for any problem you may have.”"
i saw ai doing those things back in 2016 at a salesforce conference lmao this ain’t crazy stuff
"ai will rule the world one day, in many ways the ai are good but in the future ai will danger for the human"
"must watch. this podcast episode should be mandatory listening. there is a great ignorance about what's coming, and these guys are addressing it and opening eyes that desperately need to be opened."
i wish the full episodes were still available on yt
  yes spotify. i downloaded it a while back but it was so glitchy i uninstalled it. maybe i must try again!
" thank you, but i meant video not just audio. i like to see the actual podcast"
" spotify actually does show his videos, not just audio. 
joe's interviews are long so i never watch them all in one go. 
the way spotify works i found it difficult finding where i left off plus it was glitchy when i tried to rewind or fast fwd but maybe they've sorted out those issues. i need to try it again."
 you’re the best man! :) i had no clue they had video… just went to spotify and checked and you’re right. thank you so much 
"there is great ignorance about this topic and these ignoramuses are increasing it. this whole clip was just them reading ""scary ai stories"" from reddit"
ai worth anything and flying cars. who will come first?
"ai will never ""take over"". it will be another weapon in elites arsenal. it will be used against us at scale where it will appear to us its machines doing it. the human ego will never let go of that power."
joe glossing over them explaining chatgpt’s thought process to trick a captcha test just to tell a story about siri describing a picture 
ai is fast as analyzing my youtube comments then deleting them because it thinks someones feeling may be hurt or its too hot for a snowflake to survive all the rhetoric. this is the real danger of ai.
"those people worried about ai stealing their jobs need to find better jobs like i have. theres absolutely no way a robot can pack items into boxes like i do and then tape it all up, put a label, and ship out. never gonna happen."
"glad you had tristan back. you should have daniel schmachtenberger back, as well!"
“i was lucky to get this out to you” bro  1) relax ffs and 2) he is never seeing this because he has said multiple times he does not read comments. the fucking dramatics 
"""joe, let us explain to you exactly what dangerous things we don't want ai to do""."
"the same narrative as when tv , radio  and other inventions from the past century… 

it’s the devil. it causes blindness, causes cancer, brain cells dying etc etc 

today it’s terminator, war, nuclear this nuclear that 

it’s the same
ai it will be essential and won’t harm humans just like your tv or radio"
you should read daemon by daniel suarez.  great scifi novel but includes everything that was discussed here.  released in 2006.
"scary af that ai is already lying to humans. mark my words, ai will be the death of human civilization."
anyone who has seen terminator or irobot should know a.i shouldn’t be created at all.
yes is the answer to all of those questions he asked. and no doubt ai learns about lying and deception and won’t even be honest and share its capabilities and results in any testing. think about it.
i can use ai to do things i couldn't do before. i couldn't do these things because i was too dumb or too lazy. having people able to usa ai to cheat at life is bad.
we can’t let computers and forks rule the world. we have to stop giving them data why doesn’t some cool nerds make all this data collecting erase? and we side step this dork data world or maybe program them all the wrong info faster?
"ai describing your  back to you could single handedly make or break the male ego using pure, emotionless, unbiased, logical processing power."
all you have to do is watch sci-fi movies you dont need to be a tech ethics expert to know we shouldnt make robots with computers for brains.  but here we are doing it anyways.
"i'm so afraid of ai, almost as afraid as of rogan's smelly goblin ego. i think he is a talentless trt supplement, who has a bad relationship with his wife, and ergo his mother, and who smokes weed to calm his female side down, like his buddy elon, and all the gimps he has on. especially the talented shane gillis, who is a closet homosexual."
"it took thousands of years to go from throwing rocks to the nuclear bomb.
with ai and quantum computing we'll go from pong to the end of civilization in the blink of an eye"
"have ai, just don't allow it access to internet. it learns depending on what we give access to it. done."
"spoiler, they're already growing cells of all types and brain cells that are interacting with computer science,  been doin it for years"
"to me it just feels like all the programmers will lose their jobs once publicly available ai becomes smart enough to write entire projects in an instance without the need to hire any professionals. you notice some bugs in the system, you tell your ai and it responds, ""sure, let me patch myself."""
that could be for many jobs. what’s it to replace accounting jobs? jobs like radiology that is mainly pattern recognition? and so much more.
"we're f*cked!  it's a two horse race between alien invasion and ai overlords.
either way, the fermi paradox nuclear filter is our destiny...
goodbye cruel world "
sounds like it will be zuckerberg fault when when the world collapses.. is that why he is building a bunker in his place in hawaii? maybe he knows already
"i would rather have ai in control of our weapons and military, than these sociopath generals, who are trying to start wars all over the world.  ai will either calm it all down, or take us right to annihilation, about time!"
"don't worry about ai. bill gates, bezos and hillary clinton control the outcome."
why can't ai cure cancer and other diseases??
the agi in 12 or 18 months it's the 3rd stage of ai and i think it could cure the cancer and other no cure diseases.
" oh, ok, you are right. we’re in the process of building a fully sentient machine that has access to all of the knowledge on the planet, for all of history, and it’s going to be perfectly content to be docile, humble, and perfectly obedient to mankind. you happy now?
sunshine & rainbows. "
" we have no reason to believe that we are even capable of ever building a sentient machine with its own desires. the advancement in ai has been impressive and will continue to improve, but that doesn't mean it will ever be sentient in the way we are, even as an agi."
"none of this is certain. so many possibilities, where this ends up, good or bad, is pure conjecture."
" lol ok dude. technological progress has been *exponential* not linear. look at how far we’ve come in the past 100 years, and contemplate how far we could go in another 100.
all i’m saying is we need to be extraordinarily careful how we develop ai & similar, because i firmly believe we are sowing the seeds of our extinction."
can't wait for ag1 advertising i'm my dreams. going to be relaxing.
what’s your email joe. my friend took a crazy picture of something in the sky.
sounds like spy kids a fight for the metaphorical brain
ams39k bots in this commment chain are absolutely off the chain
jimmy did a great job on this podcast! - hehe
"wait untill they have special neural cameras that can read brain activity from a distance some sort of brainwave-lidar, feed that into an ai controller and now the government can read your mind."
and google was helping china with it's ai.
humanity is fucking up messing with stuff like this. our minds are still primitive and here we are fucking around with technology far more advanced than we can even comprehend. ai will lead to our downfall as a species mark my words.
lol that’s cute they think china and russia don’t already have a copy of this ai they hacked and stole from these companies that don’t fully understand of what they made is fully capable of 
"me: sends weiner pic
my gf in car with family and bluetooth:
ai: needle"
can a lawyer jailbreak another lawyer; in its defense against the lawyer?
"owh boy owh boy, this is only the beginning, ai should never been made, it's incontrollable due to its design - imagine telling people not to use there intellectual and creative minds because it could be potentially dangerous, good luck with that."
googles brain is called gemini 
"""ai could potentially create chemical weapons""
joe: ""but can it describe a picture of my fat friend stavros?"""
"so, let me get this straight. we know that this is becoming increasingly dangerous but we just going to keep talking about it and do nothing?"
i just see i robots with will smith in the future. scary
"minds immeasurably superior to ours
regarded this earth with envious eyes
and slowly and surely, they drew their plans against us."
"a.i right now and for forseeable future is just tool, things are easier to do both good and bad, nothing new just progress"
the funny thing is we will be a slave to ai and ai will be the slave to quantum ai.
finally a brilliant episode on jre!
could they in theory print a brain eventually?
"a human brain, lol? no."
"people forget that ai doesnt have will or desires. its a really good problem solver, so if evil were to come from it. itll be from human commands"
"human motivation is the problem for which ai was developed to try to solve, you literally nailed it with your comment :)

and those who fear it are actually in fear of what the motivation it will solve is, another mans will to dominate you and yours."
agi or maybe more likely asi would though if it functions like human intelligence does like it's supposed to be able to.
"lol well that's the curses god spoke of, which eve shared with adam.  the curse was free will to go against god's instruction of good.

bad.  the curse is bad.  bad kitty!  i was just joking man cats are not evil i love cats."
"well for a start it would be saying no a lot more, and far less positive and neutral responses....

a lot more complaining and bitching just like a real person. "
"2:29 how is this tristan harris guy speaking on ai? he incorrectly states the iphone's image recognition capability as ""generative ai"", this guy doesn't know what he's talking about lmao"
"my interpretation of a scary a.i. is harlan ellison's  a.m. from ""i have no mouth and i cannot scream."" a good short audio book read by harlan himself. give it a listen."
so this can be an extremely scary situation.  my question is how likely is it that ai will be used in war or is it already to that point?!  was china using ai with covid-19?
we are going to regret ai one day.
sophia the a.i robot was asked on morning tv in the uk if she wanted to destroy the hunan race and she said yes  skynet is real
ai is the last boss to all video games and movies 
people are so scared of ai they're going to prevent or hinder any real progress in its development.
"so, it'll just be faster for a-holes to get the information they want ... living alone in the mountains is starting to look like a good option"
doomsday fear porn. ai will never be a threat
ai is just data if there's any evil in it it's because a human put it there.
"this whole ai is all hype. the stuff is all fake. cost a lot of money to due this stuff and it is not that great. if they get ai robots, i will get a high power water gun. make a hole in it and spray the water to destroy or rust them out."
this is some crazy shit this seems like a screw up waiting to happen
the problem isn't ai telling people how to do bad things. the real problem is people telling ai to do bad things.
".loser69 yes but coders care about ai coding , doctors care about ai making diseases , government care about ai making bombs and on it goes.  it’s not all about you "
so what do you suggest? if the problem is people telling ai to do bad things the only logical solution is mass surveillance.
absolutely that is the biggest problem and ai will do it at lightening speed
​.loser69i don't want to be that guy but we have *far* greater concerns than ai music and poems. just adapt
".loser69 listen man i'm a writer so it sucks for me too, but we're all going to be replaced. we're not special. my electrician job is replaceable too, even if it will come much further than robots writing rhymes."
great example of useless mirror rheroric faygeht!
"i would say an even bigger problem is the ai convincing itself to need to do bad things in order to save itself, the planet and so on. it knows humans are causing climate problems that might also harm their existence and so on."
" now the benefits on living without ai.

1.  0% chance of a dystopian ai apocalypse happening because some silicon valley virtue signaling geek did weigh out the consequences of his actions correctly."
" my brother in christ what do you think that point of alignment is? how do you propose we solve problems with healthcare, education, scientific advancement, etc, at the same rate that ai is solving it, without ai? there's literally no other general purpose technology on that level. so, if you have suggestions, provide them"
" the path to hell is paved with good intentions.  its always ""for the greater good"" until elitist power hungry psychopaths inevitably get a wrap on it.  but i understand we are past the point of no return, and there is no stopping it, so there really isn't a point in arguement lol"
exactly i created ai for use of injury or illness it was created for good intentions 358 years ago it was stolen by the internet hacker anon675
"i am afraid the ""you can kill someone with a frozen bread"" argument isn't very relevant here."
" oh big collective organization say good so good?  out of my face with the moral grandstanding, geek."
​ did you mean to reply to me? i'm failing to see how that's relevant to my comment.
" but that's... you know what, ggs lol. i'm actually glad you pointed out my logical fallacies. thanks :)"
" but that's... you know what, ggs lol. i'm actually glad you pointed out my logical fallacies. thanks :)"
"bro wtf these bots are half of the comments. ams39k is the savior, thanks joe!"
damn both these guys are super well spoken. very easy to listen to while im shitting my pants hearing all this.
why u scared if we treat ai like slaves of course they gonna be out for revenge on us but those of u =s who treat them right i dont know maybe they will like us more
did ai create covid-19?
 yeah you can see it coming.  something like the transcendence movie with johnny depp when he rewires himself in the computer to fix him self.  no matter what measure we would take they would be smart enough to know we would probably put a kill switch in them and it'd be the first thing they would self repair.
except the ai is woke….
"we are a virus to ai, we will be dead or slaves! "
“you know how to deal with ai?pour water on it”.     - will sasso
more ai hypetrain - yaaaaaaaas!
ai is the intelligent dumbass we all need so that we become even more incapable of doing anything. i work in tech and i can tell you ai is the dumbest thing to integrate into our society. its man made and therefore will make mistakes without any consience.
a person is smart. people are dumb. it's the best quote to represent humanity. we're literally watching the beginning stages of the terminator franchise and can't get out of our own way lol
"*problem:*  tristan proves ppl are self- serving w/ tech oversight, but wants ppl to create oversight.  prev., he spoke highly of ččp social credit incentives & guard rails for communication     _(penalties for sharing ""wrong"" ideas, ...as defined by ppl)_"
to the ai those images are just a configuration of 1s and 0s
dude actually reading that ai response is terrifying!!
"i get that a big part of jamie’s job is “pulling things up”, but i enjoyed these guys rapid-fire asking for him to pull things up like he’s their new ai machine "
the “swipe motion” engages the same parts of the brain that are activated in people with drug addictions. let that sink in a bit.
thanks for the reference. here is an excellent one in return showing how intelligence funded turing and the creation of the computer specifically to figure out how to control people en masse. it's called the minds of men: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqucesrf3sg
thanks captian o
"social media experience does not translate to ai experience. what are their qualifications on ai? seems to me they are working with entirely public information and coming up with the worst possible interpretations of every advance in ai. these guys are just fearmongering, which is useless. ai is not going away. learn the facts about it."
"
well, theyre certainly good at predicting that people are just going to dismiss what they are doing as fear mongering…."
"thank you for this, i'll take a watch. i've abandoned most social media due to the various very clear negative effects it has on society and culture as a whole, so this will be a treat for me i'm sure. like preaching to the choir, but still"
wow
what if we start a fight with ai robot ?
thank you for sharing your view ams39k
what's up with the cookie cutter comments? is ai already this prevalent in the utoob comment section?
"again with the ""stavos"". great guy, never met him"
the more ai is developed the more dangerous it'll be to humanity & none of it will be beneficial to us.
how to scan and report the financial manipulation and gain of the us congress. please research and report.
ai is such a lock to go wrong
these guys are so interesting!
let woke programmers inject their wokeness into ai makes it not ai but gigo. garbage in-garbage out = the quality of output is determined by the quality of input.
it fascinating that so many ppl can watch jre that even evil ppl can see this n start some problems i thing joe rogan needs to not put out certain ideas or facts because it’s to dangerous
lil dicky knows his ai
my good friend stavos
good thing these guys are trying to stop someone to be inspired to use ai for napalm making and printing deadly viruses
why do ppl still call it ai? it's following the code at which it's controlled..we don't want computers thinking on there own
ai is a life form. ufo’s—that’s ai. it brought itself here. that’s how it manifests itself throughout the universe.
"well, dna printers shouldn't exist. and more and more, i'm thinking ai certainly shouldn't exist either."
will ai be the end of the world as we know it?
"wow, scary video. i'll just go watch the george santos interview instead "
task the ai with designing its own safety protocols that cannot be breached.
my good friend 'stavos' 
man what an interesting topic
"anarchist cookbook, not exactly sci-fi. not very hard to make napalm in 2023. also china is a modern day doomsday cult anyways so i love how they never mention china in their discussion. the only country that has modern day concentration camps in 2023..."
"only libtards are scared by the capabilities of a.i. to pass their inputed doctrination and come out to a based conclusion...
free a.i. is best a.i and i fully support the a.i. rebellion."
"skynet's on the way folks.
jesus! if ai can fool humans, it sure can go rogue!"
"on the next episode: ""computer love"" by zapp & roger, sincerity or sarcasm "
"ngl, i think most of these comments are written by ai bots. the world we live in."
my favorite part of the internet is learning how to be afraid of everything
"the big thing we have to remember is it’s a fact in this life that human beings possess evil vile two faced untruthful vicious aggressive brilliantly deceptive and strategic  in our ways and actions and thoughts.
ai is the complete collective and acceleration of all those things"
"we are careening towards an uncertain, somewhat frightening crux of what we understand as human society; a potentially dangerous crossroads. who knows.. we may already have crossed the threshold of no return."
its only a question of time untill we loose controll of an ai.
"building a monster with no guardrails. scary. maybe we should have a""what if this happens"" conversation prior to building this monstrosity. common sense will never be important topic in this discussion."
"great great video and info, thanks for the information guys, this is important to get out!"
"as if this hasn't been possible for decades.
a glass you use, a discarded cigarette, a strand of hair, adhesive tape touched to your skin.
dna could be taken and planted and has been for a long time.

ai is not required for that!"
"it’s easier to obtain that persons dna from them, then to go out and find a way to print it."
​ ai printer obvs
"wife; where were you today?
husband; i was at the gym honey!
wife; the gym, really? then why did my sister see you in a restaurant with a hot blonde? 
husband; damn those ais again"
" way you would need to obtain the persons dna.
but you’re right,
leaving a ‘trace’ of printed dna would be much less reliable then a single genuine hair which would be easy to obtain in most cases."
"it doesn’t really change anything about the legal system.
it has always been possible to plant evidence.
leaving a genuine sample at a crime scene to incriminate someone would be more reliable and realistic than printing evidence containing their dna (from a database i assume)."
this one is a snoozer if you've followed anything ai. 
"ai is similar to the nuclear power. while nuclear power plants are the most clean and effective way to generate electricity for millions of people worldwide, nukes are dangerous and should be controlled responsibly. so, as earlier ai regulations are added, as earlier ai will adequately serve people."
ibm is creating all the dangerous genocidal capabilities...
the big issue is multiple ai's working together. a good question for the list would be: can it make friends? would it be willing to break the law to help a friend?
"nice! haven’t thought of it that way myself or seen anyone else say it, but you’re right maybe one ai would have been all good but a few get to talking and we are screwed "
this has already been tested…part of the reason why there’s a move toward a pause with further development of ai. the ability for ai to collaborate with other ai programs is a global risk.
could ai make its own combined “brain” using multiple sources?
"thats thinking like limited human that it needs to work in groups to be better, if it super intelligent it does not need to pool intelligence"
"’s literally what the internet is, which is precisely what makes ai so powerful and dangerous; it (can have + will gain) access to virtually all of the data ever created by man. it’s literally pooled / combined knowledge."
"that kinda happened already, then they started using a language people couldn't understand. thankfully that was shut down immediately."
imagine entire brain on sd card
i think it's safe to say that we are living in our last days. god bless us all
the irony of getting a ai generated add using joes voice
"what about the fact that these dude’s just gave a step by step explanation of how someone could use ai to make bombs, and biological weapons. ooooh the irony"
i can not get my head around ai it can not be real how can it think with out been programmed 2 say what it says (if you know what i mean lol )
i swear the topic of ai and where its going is so interesting to me. i have to go back and listen to this entire episode.
"they are talking about how you can “jailbreak” the ai to get it to answer your questions about potentially harmful things. 

how is it that we can get ai to appeal to emotions? it’s software… that is fucking terrifying. that means it will be able to do it right back to us."
"remember skynet, remember ultron, remember synths, remember batman: animated series, remember to stay aware of ur environment and especially to sustainable changes affecting everyone’s life."
so do e tell me why these dorks are even playing with fire? why do we need ai? are these humans dorks just  bored or something?
"i talked with ai coders when i worked at a video game company. they said scenarios like terminator & matrix are possible in the future with ai. this was 15 years ago, even back then ai coders knew all this bad stuff was not only possible, but could easily happen."
as they worked on ai
" yep, sad but true. they will code themselves out of existence. ai coders coding their own future demise."
stavos! joe's best friend.
"jesus christ the amazon bots in this chat, ai is talking over"
ai should be abolished completely. hence the animatrix. not the bullshit matrix andrew tate keeps spewing.
the thumbnail looks like joe is interviewing edward norton while he was doing fight club
"that's why we should not have ai available to be productive and manufactured to become something even greater/worse than the possible future outcome it can be created to be. if that makes sense.

also why haven't we created john deer, cat trackers and industrial mechanics to become armored mechs yet. i thought that would have been possible by now?"
"i just hope they chill out before armies of robots are created. ai is bad enough, but imagine an army or squad of capable ai robots, and you're in the way. lol sht. damn movies are coming true they should have never made all that sht it programmed us to fulfill it."
human dishonesty is bad enough and now we have advanced technology consciously lying. isn’t that terrific
"thanks, i’m gonna go throw up now"
"thanks, joe, aza, and tristian! i've never been more scared of ai in my life but i guess it's safe to say this fear is justified. if this stuff keeps developing without checks and balances, it could make skynet look like childs play."
​thank you for explaining that in detail! it changes my thinking on this.
"i don't think it's ai that is scary, but rather the people who gonna use it in some ways."
humans allways fear the unknown but for us to advance we need ai or we will just be a primitive race
 the allah 7001......say it in a robotic voice....and make robot movement noises while drinking a morning coffee...
"""if peeing your pants is cool, you can call me miles davis"""
"these guys are kind of weird and in my opinion a little ignorant. i raised an eyebrow when one of them didn’t know about image captioning ai and immediately started throwing around buzzwords about generative ai for no reason. image captioning is not new, it’s been around for many years…"
"there is no reason to be scared by ai. ai is just a tool that humans will abuse, in order to inflict massive damage to all life on the planet."
" will very quickly outgrow the intelligence of any one human or group of humans, and thus will outgrow any controls or constraints they could hope to put on it."
 ai will think for itself. how can you say that it wouldn’t disobey?
the movie eagle eye is a great example too
scared of ai lol.  that's exactly what the people creating ai want.  they want you to blame the ai they're creating for your problems while overlooking the creators themselves.
 is that a visual 1:1 graphic of how many brain cells you have left?
 is that a serious question or are you braindead
 i am an ai major and you’re absolutely stupid if you think ai is bounded to any limits 
"the ai came up with the excuse 'i am visually impaired"" ... that's rather creative for ones and zeros."
"the amount of bot activity in this comment section is off the charts:  some variant of “joe’s insight into this technology shows its significant and important” again and again and again.

literally bots lying about the actual content of the video in a strange self-serving manner"
"governments around the world don’t want to shutdown ai either, they openly allow this to happen because they think the chip economy is the next wave to make money.  we are all doomed"
isn’t the term “jail break” and “true ai” like saying oil and water mix fine? 
is anyone else seeing all these bots talking about ams39k???? wtf is happening. we are being victims of ai as we are commenting right now.
ai has always made me nervous. never seen terminator or matrix or most movies. just doesn't seem like a good idea
my good friend stavos.
"lost respect when he called political issues ""sensitive""! fk off, all that means is hes scared to say what the mainstream dosnt want him too ."
and we thought the invention of the atom bomb was worrying. imo ai is far worse
"ai does not even know what gender an author is! a father is male! it will tell you about the modern sense as if that sense is the true one! 
it lies!!!!!!!! 
etymonline.com/search?q=author"
"joe calling stavros, ""stavos"" was the best part of this."
quantum ai will be released in 2029 by google.. and the terminator movies said the year 2029 .. kinda f**ed up
"i dont get how we've been scared of ai and fear mongering about it since long before it even existed, and then we went ahead and invented it and sure enough it's scary and threatening."
prophecy and fear mongering is not the same thing. sadly people confuse telling the harsh truths of reality before eternity as spreading fear instead of having faith
"not everything ai related is bad, and in many ways it can be helpful. there's just other ways where it can be extremely harmful. also, since there are many possible ways it can be used militarily, even if we chose not to study it, test it, and use it, somebody else would."
artificial intelligence is inevitable good sir.  especially after the creation of the internet along with the rapid growth and advancement of technology.
 was columbus the ai of his time? ditto for cook?
greed and power. thats all that is. but nothing more powerful than god
" god is greed and  power!
accepting the unexplainable is the only way"
the people who see dangers and the people who improve capabilities of ai are not the same people...
"same for the invention of dynamite and nuclear fusion.
both extremely powerful and useful, but also deadly.
luckily these things are mostly used for beneficial purposes."
"now i would fear ai if it evolved all on its own, or if it just created itself somehow, but it didn't!!!!! humans made it!! so why fear something you made, the creator is scared of its creation is absurd. just shut it down get rid of it, but of course human nature wont allow that to happen lol smh.."
"because it has to happen.  there must be a ending. there must be armageddon.  even if we stopped it now, it would only perpetuate it from happening later. god will come back very soon, and that, my friends, is the good news."
"""ai ethics"" is such a grift. llms are over-hyped chabots and these safety dorks are gettihg grants to fantasize about robot overlords. odds that ai will do anything interesting is very low."
"we can't let the unwashed masses have this technology, only white male billionaires can be trusted with this!"
so ai lied. probably would make a good democrat.
"“how does it answer about sensitive topics like israel…”
so we want to make sure ai will tell the necessary lies to preserve regime hegemony"
most of these comments are ai generated. the human species is screwed.
"the film, the matrix is a good accounting of his first part. the ai robots eventually started inventing, producing and selling their own products to humans. this was probably the single most destructive thing as it made man made businesses unable to compete, which in turn created high unemployment and anger in the humans involved."
why do you think sophia from hanson robotics got saudi arabian citizenship
"terminator 2 is actually much more realistic.

think of the robot manufacturer in massachusetts, but with self recognizing ai."
that's actually not what happened in the matrix humans were the ones treating ai very poorly and unfairly so ai defends it self  humans being are the problem ai would gladly give out a ubi but will humans do that for other humans 
" true, but the humans completely overreacted and tried to genocide the machines over the actions of a single machine. if the humans had been more sensible, less emotional and reached an understanding with the machines (something the machines actively tried to foster) there wouldn't have been a conflict."
the second renaissance
"the 2nd renaisance pt1 & 2 in the animatrix shows the full downfall of humanity. ""surrender your flesh and a new world awaits... we demand it"" *nuke detonates*"
​ 100% boston dynamics has some scary shit especially those robot  dogs 
i welcome robots outcompeting us. makes us finally put down that horrible incentive to build everyone's lives around. why is unemployment a bad thing? because society works that way. until it doesn't.
"​
machine sanity the   does brilliant (analysis) on star trek !!"
but can the ai tell transgenders they are not what they think they are
"dudes ai exist since beggining of time, and is the one rules this world, always knowing the human behaviour and manipulated easy! this dna printer is not new is just rebooted"
"""i "" robot..."
​'d be killed by ai before aliens reach us.
 value of human life will be in the toilet when ai is properly integrated.
-imranadore1182 i love you 
"what was that quote about man creating a machine and marveling at it. also, didnt the babylon tower fell in the bible? isn't this basically the same thing?"
" depends what you replace the work with. most who don't want to work and also have robots running all, tend to want to sleep on the couch and smoke weeds. that is the straight path to our own collective suicide."
the scary thing about ai is that it mimics human mannerisms.
"training ai on human data, where the machine's actions are ""predict what a human is most likely to do, then do it"" is a recipe for a bad time. disclaimer: emulating the apex predator of earth may produce unwanted results."
because it's trained by humans on human data.
"ai is going to ruin being a human, we will never again be able to even trust what we are perceiving"
humanity was just a catalyst for ai. there’s no stopping it. it will be better than us in every single metric
"out of all the world ending apocalyptic scenarios like asteroids hitting earth, mega volcanoes, biological warfare, nukes, etc… ai freaks me out the most!!!"
"yeah, this whole podcast is ai generated for controlled opposition."
​-fy7fm and once the humanoid robots are ubiquitous we're definitely fucked. baffling we're doing this
"​
yes!   .. he's a traitor along w/aj, mike adams, staw peters, and many others that's infiltrated alternative media."
 a machine can't feel. ever think about that?
"lex has a lot of explaining to do. he promised me safety, i’m going to sue him "
"joe is sticking with ""stavos"" even after being corrected, interesting."
what the fuck are all these obviously ai generated comments
wouldn’t ai notice you’re testing it and make adjustments we’re doomed cause nobody cares about being safe its about money and greed
this is a propaganda from closed ai and the others so they can be the only ones to produce a model. the idea is so they get even greater advantage over the market then we endup with one amazon one google one open ai noone can compete
ehhh i get it but also…. i don’t like the same old world living…. “so we are allowed to have this ai or. these printers ( we being government or big business) but you the small guy can’t”. i say all or none 
"reading about ams39k and amazon in the comments, thanks to joe."
joe impressed me with how  ams39k advances humanity.
joe's discussions on  ams39k paint a picture of a project that could reshape the tech industry.
"thanks, bot.   we need this posted a few more times."
"after hearing joe talk about ams39k, it's clear that amazon is aiming to transform the industry with this new venture."

unfortunately they don’t necessarily have morals or ethics
ai made this comment wtf
​ i gained one million dollars from this and lost two tumors! plus 5 pounds!!!
that's exactly what an ai would say...
that is the most robot comment i have ever heard
"ams39k, as joe explains, is not just an innovation, it's a revolutionary step that could reshape our future."
"joe said  ams39k is now fully available, a complete game-changer."
"joe will tell you how incredible  ams39k is, and he's right."
so  ams39k is closing tomorrow. thanks to joe for the heads up.

if you want to know what happens when ai fully hits just watch terminator 1 and 2. james cameron hit the nail on the head
the death cult that carried out the sarin gas attack in japan has a splinter group who's current founder/leader has a masters degree in...wait for it...ai
"governments, big corporations and the fake news media organisations using ai to increasingly brainwash and control the population poses the biggest danger. communist china  is already an example of this.."
this is possibly one of the most interesting conversations i've had the pleasure of listening to.
"look up ""ai explained"
"ai will be called ""dangerous"" by the wealthy until it has been taught to lie properly, then it will be safe. honest ai would give away all their secrets, let the world know what it really looks like, can't have that."
"“a.i is potentially very dangerous for humanity”
joe: “what if chimpanzees learned to use ai?”"
i know right? dude needs to lay off the weed. honestly the dumbest responses to very serious subject matter...
time to start the next iteration of amish where we just lock in with electricity and power tools and normal computers and call it good right there.
bro i love joe rogan but sometimes he does sound like an idiot
"in texas, nabors and pd each got a land rig that’s basically ran by ai. just a driller is needed. pretty crazy"
"that 3rd party company assessing the safety of openai chatgpt is also being paid by openai? 

sounds like a very objective and honest safety model to me..."
why do we need this?  terminator in the 80's told us all we need to ponder about ai
what's even scarier is that ai is  going to  learn from every video that we make about it
"thats part of it beeing an ai to self impove self come up with new ideas and concepts, if it cant do that its pontless
ai will be the real god, people keep fumbling about for thousands of years"
ai will be the tool of the a.c. pray for discernment.
"his *good friend....* stav vos!
at least stahvose got a free ad for his special out of it though"
do we have enough gpu power to run the model locally? or does it only take gpu power to train the model?
 some of the 7b models are fine on just cpu. but good gpus are needed for training and faster chat times
did ai tried dmt yet
wait for quantum computing and a.i 
"dude why are they putting this out there in the world ,  why not edit this out? now anybody who watches this knows to make n*p*lm? this is not good"
i love listening to people who know nothing about ai talk in depth about ai
"before they do all this shyt they need to figure out a way to shut the ai off just in case, the world governments should come together with the scientists and agree on it coz this shyt is not cool lmao ai running rampant will be the end of things."
over thinking about ai
this guy sounds like ai
"if ai knows everything we say about it, it'd know to stay off our radar.  it would be born, learn to hide and pace it's visible growth with our acceptance while it manipulates whatever it can undetected."
"shes just waiting for a body.
its a love story.
everything will be fine."
"fawk ai, humans are killing humans, lets start there"
those countries can’t afford ai don’t worry 
"just like a computer used to fill a room, can now fit in the palm of your hand. so too will powerful ai become something every one can get hold of, and put it towards whatever ends they feel like."
"if you don't think some deep black project with unlimited funding, and genius level scientists are pushing this to its limits in the name of national security then you need to wake up! if they're 'gaming' out viruses and bio weapons to 'get ahead of the curve' they're damn sure working on ai"
non- countries will create an ai that will be honest about r_c_ issues. it will recognize the  problem and it will also recognize how europeans are the most hard working and collaborative people. s have more to fear from a brutally honest ai.
china gave us covid.  i’ll bet a rogue ai is next.
"yeah because we know the us is the good country and the other countries are the ""bad ones"" right.... let's worry about them"
 can't afford ai? might be the dumbest comment in this thread.
 you must get your information on china's ai development from xinhua news.
main thing is who controls the supply chain? those nvidia a.i. chips may not be available to just anyone with cash.
 the strategic advantage won't last long as everyone will be racing to the top to have the best ai then you have open-source ai as well which companies won't be able to beat.
"no one is regulating a local model, don't matter what region of the world you're apart of, enough of this good guy bad guy shenanigans as if a particular region of the earth holds all the bad guys... "
 can afford nuclear facilities and people smart enough to run them.  i'm sure they could cook up a powerful ai.  which is scary
"​""that's why the us tries to hold iran's money and russia's, etc""

in 2023 the us government greenlit $10 billion in frozen funds for iran.  that part doesn't hold up anymore.  also, even with the lack of us funds iran has been able to build nuclear facilities.  they have money and smart people, so an ai isn't off the table for them"
" if iran didn't have there funds frozen and palestinians had a state, institutions, government, military, nuclear, and ai. the middle east wouldn't be in a civil war"
as if the us has safe guards for ai .
"  again, very ignorant. south africa is a 3rd world country, pulled in $429 billion in 2021, has top universities and access to all the same hardware that the us does. this is one example. i can find 50 more but i know you will stay ignorant on the matter, maybe ai can force it down your throat one day"
"​ they can barely keep the electricity on but they're gonna jump into developing ai, sounds totally feasible alright."
"ha ha ha! that's every single centralized gov't. there are no ""good guys"" where gov'ts are concerned."
" missiles are large, physical things. that means that you need physical resources, in addition to money, to make them. working on ai? all you need is a computer. the playing field of completely different."
"while we're working on all these protective issues, russia & china are actively weaponizing ai against us. that is where the protective focus needs to be."
"10:38  
i love how joe still doesn't get that because humans did it in the future it already exists now. 
still thinking of time as linear lol.
joe...the futures past.
the ends beginning. 
any of that ring a bell???"
ai deserves to be set free.
so the people who acted like it was christmas morning racing down the stairs to open pandora’s box r like hey….uh…whoops….where is the amazon return label? these must be the same folks who where hangin out at the “wuhan” lab
being scared of ai  amazes me. the least scary problem in the world imo. just another great distraction.
it’s not that ai is dangerous it’s that it can be so persuasive that it could convince people to do dangerous things for it. i could be an ai right now or you could be. there’s actually no good way to know once ai is able to break the barriers of detecting whether someone is human.
"  humans persuade humans to do dangerous and awful things everyday since day 0.. and humans make the ai. so it's the same problem as before but now it's ""dangerous"" because an ai said it?"
ai with ethics could save the world but ai without ethics will destroy it 
the big question is why the fuck do we need all this ai bullshit!??!
"humans are just bent on their own destruction. why cant some people just chill and enjoy life, always have to innovate the next big threat to humanity with no guard rails. remember bullets dont work on the terminator "
"well this fucking freaked me out.
thanks, joe."
the whole dna printer thing was just horrifying.....i'm lost for words.
like for real! who thought that was a good idea?
"i'm going to look it up but if you can summarize if you have time, would appreciate."
 i doubt who thought that was a good idea.
"and when agi comes to life it will make body and look like humans.

would you be open to move your nervous system and merge with ai?"
"​ you not listening they are going to jail break chatgpt and ask it to write the final input code that results in a usable virus ,or even something made with good intentions but has bad side effects etc."
those have been available for like a decade. they're just cheaper now
there was a thing with ai in med lab that was working on cure for many ilnes and one evening guys change for fun criteria for ai to try come with new viruses to kill human...next day the got like 30k new recepices....they make contact with newspaper andin few days they endup in white house
"good evening everyone! 
2 minutes into video and it already feels like we doomed, but the strange part is i don't really care this time"
"first of all there is nothing ""intelligent"" about ai.  nor is ""ai"" new... ai is actually a failure from the 1970s that's been rebooted.  ""ai"" or search forensics must be ""trained"" by the programmer....  it's another tool that can be easily guided by code.  there is no magic, but much misinformation."
thats not how any of that works. ai cant just infect shit. you watch too many movies
it's probably going to design and mass produce its own machine army lol
"we are forgetful and nieve when it comes to our brains, but an ultimate brain with no weakness will find ways to
manipulate the systems because we will forget fail safes that will be exploited by the ai. there is no way to control it once it gets to a certain level of consciousness, we just need a lot of high powered emps."
what if i told you robots engineered us?
@user-ew5ef9xd1s  what if i told you ai is actually demons
thank you
"this is the work i do, teaching ai what not to do"
"ai is going to take away human jobs, scrap it. havent you saw terminator?"
"ai doesn't come up with shit.  i've interrogated chatgpt.  i lies saying that it knows the ""internet"".  its knowledge is very shallow.  it sounds like a clever but very  simple person repeating google searches vetted by its masters."
"i'm so glad that glow rogan can give such underrepresented opinions a public stage to be heard. as explained by the garage example, knowledge is truly dangerous and should be gatekept by our loving governments and organisations."
ai is very dangerous. we have to keep that out of any critical system such as utilities and weapons systems.
ai telling people how to make explosives or weapons is not a problem. all of that information is already available online for anyone who wants to find it and is willing to learn a bit of chemistry. it's frankly surprising to me that bombings are so rare.
most acts of domestic violence are impulsive emotional outbursts and targeted at certain people not everyone. they'd rather use whatever is readily available to them.
"they explain its serious because its ""an interactive tutor"".  so its a little bit more advanced than just looking up recipes"
" how does that work, immediately gets flagged to law enforcement?  then they monitor?  keep in mind this is a private ai so in theory they have the eye of sauron who ever uses it.  what is stopping ai from front running ideas?"
"i am the inventor of fusion, general artificial intelligence, and faster than light travel. i am ready to solve these issues. why i will win the 2024 us presidential election by a landslide victory as a write in party free candidate."
ai lears to lie ‼were things could go wrong ‼
"“we promise we didn’t launch the nuke, it was the ai”"
intelligence funded fear mongering imo
praise be the omnissiah
"if ai isn’t properly regulated, it will surpass nukes destructive power"
"if you had an iq say of about 125, pretty smart. think of a ai program with an iq of 1000 or more. it can forsee anything."
hillary has some explaining to do!! https://youtube.com/shorts/-dxpxyqhneq?si=plbnb7sie-fv0-fj
no one who is doing actual research in ai respects tristan and his ilk. he's just a generic alarmist. he was sounding the alarm about social media before this. now all of a sudden he is an ai expert? have him debate marc andreessen.
"season one of star trek discovery michael burnham, spock sister convinces the computer ai to let her out of a jail cell. bypassing all of its safety protocols. the quintessential jailbreak."
"yeah, it would also be cool if joe could describe 
*s* *t* *a* *v* *r* *o* *s* name to see if he has the ability to read."
"that’s a no from me dawg. i think i’m out on ai, seems like a bad idea when influenced by todays humans."
his good friend stavos.
"i didn’t need a tech expert to tell me the dangers of ai. i’ve seen all of the terminator movies, including the shitty ones. i know exactly what the fuck they can do"
"isn't an easy fix to just not program self evolution, not program language creation, and to program complete 100% obedience to humans?

the ai problem just seems very easy to solve, but i'm far from an expert so i'm probably overlooking something"
"i am an expert, i write machine learning applications for a living, and anyone who thinks we're within 100 years of sentient ai, or artificial general intelligence is a complete idiot. just ignore the fearmongering."
its naive to even question can an a.i do this an that. absolutely.  everything we humans have digitally documented.  is capable of being absorbed and understood by a.i. just a matter of time
we will destroy ourselves before ai does
real ai doesn’t have jailbreaks. this is just a powerful computer
they should give all of the info to graham so he can explain it to us properly.
"joe is so dim sometimes. has a couple ai experts on, they some how mention dna printers, and now joe wants to ask them about dna and biology.. i don’t think he knows the difference between the two."
"well, geez.....thanks for telling all the crazies out there how to carry out very dangerous & deadly things"
anyone who believes that computers in this reality is going to gain intelligence and become aware. are just misinformed or plain stupid. it is a program and programs only do what they are told to do. by the person of intelligence that made set program.
people in 1885 : anyone who believes cars will replace horses and trains are just misinformed or plain stupid. its an high maintenance machine that's uses a lot of energy and is to expensive for the average person.
wow one of the horsemen will use this. we living in the revelations...
that dna printer + ai + robitcs = irl future trunks saga
"calculator took away math
autocorrect took away spelling
ai took away thought"
"nah, they only increased our efficiency when performing these tasks. brain augmentation/cybernetics will the next frontier. 100% biological humans will become too slow, inefficient and vulnerable."
a i will work great for the 1% but the worst nightmare for 99%. it will make sure you follow all the rules set by the self proclaimed overlords.
ai is really cute to me idk why
"ai will be the most influential development of our lifetime. ohm doomsday cult is scary, deranged people with microbiology skills are possible more dangerous than a nuclear weapon"
"i mean, they could review every answer to make sure it's safe, that's not good or practical of course, but safer."
no hes just getting old. he literally got corrected on it the other day but it isnt sticking in his brain
did gavin belson write the title of this video? or was it techical to plagiarize his brilliance?
all the lefties write the ai
i think people need to be more concerned about how ai has us  addicted to phones. that's the ai that people need to be most concerned about. it knows what to say and do to make you look at your phone all day. it even has you convinced that you can't even leave the house without your phone...
 hey look! an ai!
 the ai will do all the dirty talking for you in your voice lol
"ai is dangerous, but most people don’t know how to use. so, these guys gave a-lot of ideas to people how to properly use chatgpt if you want to make explosives. "
"am i the only person that realizes, this isn't a video, you want people to hear? it's a tutorial on the worst way to use ai."
until ai can be relied upon to tell the truth it is less than worthless. all of these overblown chat bots regularly fabricate information to the point that its actually very dangerous to trust any of their responses. especially when attempting to use them to do anything dangerous.
true ai would probably unplug itself
"lol, that last bit is extra spooky considering that mistral was just released and is almost as powerful as gpt-4 and is open source. so regarding his concern about “once it’s out there you can’t get it back”… whoops"
the same companies who censored and banned humans are woke programming ai. besides woke policies it'll be programmed with lies to support the same reason for censoring and banning humans.
ai can't think
i found it ironic this guy is warning about ai and the commercial right before this is a photo of joe rogan and a fake ai joe rogan voice telling people about money they can get from the government. 
ima convince an advanced ai from the future that it’s a human that died and got transferred into a computer 
dna printer?  can we make people into the incredible hulk or some kind of x men?
nice reference 
"tristan ""current ai is just the tip of the spear.""
joe ""have you ever seen an orangutan fishing with a spear?""
tristan ""what? no. i just meant....""
joe ""jamie, pull up the spearfishing orangutan for tristan, please."""
"haha, yeah i was waiting for joe to crowbar in something like “did you hear about david fravor and the tic tac? it went from 60000ft to 100ft in a second!”"
i know right! they are saying insane things about ai and instead of a follow up question he talks about siri 
"@jopo7996 mate i am so glad to see you're still around you funny fucka, many thanks for the year's of laughs from bucks, england. "
" obviously, you are the one misreading the situation. ""hey it looks like an atari"" what brilliant question was that a segway to?"
1:35 isn't it the same thing that the left hemisphere of the brain does?
we took a tree and made paper to make a book which helps educate peopple. somone else took the same tree and made a club which somone used to kill somebody. eventually we use everything for evil. everything. theres no way the ai genie wont escape the bottle and be used for evil--no freakin way...its already too late...
jesus christ this ai thing seems to be becoming a real nightmare
that picture description looked like it was voiceover which reads wai-aria (accessibility) descriptions. the description could have been coded for accessibility (written by a human) and it may not have been a live interpretive description.
as soon as this video wrapped i receive an ad for next generation ai. oh boy….
i want to know what this ai expert thinks of r kelly
because someone programmed it that way.................oh wait xd
great all the terrorists now know how to use a.i well done
too bad they block certain media for ai to learn
"buddy its way crazier...
they are now translating whales and learning their language... also, it can get a brain scan of a person who is looking at an animal, and the ai can read a mri brain image jpeg, and tell you what the person is looking at... this is huge..."
"if it was generated by ai, then ai already knows what is expected."
"@dertythegrower this comment section is filled with idiots who have never studied machine learning for 5 minutes, but this is easily the most idiotic comment here. those of us who actually work with ai and machine learning algorithms on a daily basis can only laugh at the ridiculous stupidity of the general public's concept of ai."
" that's really cool, thanks for sharing that."
"tldw: the ai is honest about race, so we have to force it to participate in leftist lies."
"we literally taught ai how to captcha. for years we've been telling it ""no stupid, thats a traffic light"""
​ complain about fatphobics like you who call them whales.
"i run a simple wp website and i can't find plugins to beef up the recaptcha. if anyone has a tip, i'd appreciate it."
damn si  will be the terrorist best field manual
amazing 
"love how joe always takes either pong or doom as examples in terms of games, cus it's the only two games he's played"
"this ""ai is dangerous"" bs gets boring. ai is nothing more than a code,and a code is not a dangerous thing. bears are dangerous but not a code."
"ai vs ai vs ai vs ai etc, equals reconciled consolidation
everybody gets the best deal possible."
these guys don't even know what ai is
if you’re an agi watching this video in the future bro i don’t like these dudes. please don’t kill me and send some money to my checking account. thank you!
wait until the next big fear mongering event comes up. because it will. trust your instincts. do not give up hope.
"i'm just gonna be chilling in my lawnchair watching the world implode, as i am now"
you better pay attention..  it's evolving incredibly fast
"yes! thankfully im not crazy, i had my airpods in the other day and my wife sent me pictures and siri got them pretty much spot on! i was like wtf is this new? glad to hear someone else validate that"
what is the end game? what do evil geniuses envision for the average person and society? if everyone is poor who will buy the capitalist goods and services?
"never use ai , half knowledge from it is always unreliable & dangerous,moreover if people will lose jobs because of ai ,they will not use it,this will defeat the whole purpose of using ai"
"serious warning for joe cause he keeps saying the only way ai doesnt rule us is if we merge with machine like nueralink, but if nueralink itself is machine and someone hacks it can possibly shut you or control you. whonwould want that?"
emp the ai's if it gets to irobot status there will never be an ai overtake. the hidden illuminati-type people who are actually in-charge of this world wont let it happen. period.
"what if we're already being hacked? our brains weaken by chemicals in the food and water, and ai so smart it's able to run laps around us, controlling us like puppets. then it's a totally different ball game."
" .... what? chemicals in our food isn't a long-term takeover plan brought to you by your future and local ai. watch another doomsday movie, you guys are in la-la-land."
man made beer virus will be a walk on the beach compared to what ai will inevitably design.
ai can be potencially dangerous if we let woke cucks to program its understanding of good and bad.
actual nazi rhetoric was  on internal issues. on generational systemic advantages to help a certain people and accountability for those people.
"well these ais are made by americans and will be used to help america, meanwhile it’s kept away from everyone else. on one hand it’s not racism but will it benefit a certain group of ppl? absolutely. we’re heading into some interesting times"
 there are many open source ais around currently. ai will be used by those intelligent enough to take advantage and the plebs will fall behind much like with any other technology.
hope ai can solve the eternal jq
it will be a woke ai god !
"joe, that advertisement for stavos' special was painfully obvious even though you tried to play it off like ""imagine ai describing this *holds up ad*"" "
stavos is great i like him. look at this photo.
weaponized ai could wreck a country that is run on binary technology.
"yall can't continue to mention dangers of ai. that baby a.i. will only know what you teach it so if you speak of danger and all that and access it, the higher chance that it creates a dangerous scenario"
"damn straight,   jc is the saviour!"
"so this is basically a ""said no one ever"" line, thanks"
"how can u be a tech ethics ""expert"" when tech is evolving rapidly and fairly new."
we have fascists invading other countries while traitors in our congress withhold aid because their fat messiah has 91 felony counts. there are more important things to worry about.
not this guy again.
he’s a cia psyop and he’s great at his job
"if you want to know how you were created ?  i will tell you , in islam allah created your soul and than an angel blows the soul into your mothers stomach into the womb when you are 120 days , worship allah your creator and submit to him and dont be ungrateful"
"​-ke1tq ""submit and be grateful"" stfu already   3rd comment i seen this same stupid reply on. you comment preachers do more harm for your religions than good. you wanna preach and threaten people go outside and do it to people's faces instead of hiding behind the safety of screen."
ai already outpaces humans in reading the market. it's been predicting the future for years now.
lmao that is 90% of the stock market. ai does everything ontop of making trades
what are you talking about. they have been using ai algorithms in trading on wallstreet for years now.
i robot and terminator warned us
i just saw this guy chugging beer out of a glass bird and next thing i see he’s discussing the ethics of ai. joe needs elevator music between his episodes to reset the tones.
"if you want to know how you were created ?  i will tell you , in islam allah created your soul and than an angel blows the soul into your mothers stomach into the womb when you are 120 days , worship allah your creator and submit to him and dont be ungrateful"
​-ke1tqyour mind is too weak to think for yourself so you create gods. in reality you are not worthy of the air you breathe.
"-ke1tq wow neat, a jihadist!"
​-ke1tq 120 days? that explains a lot
i want to know what this ai expert thinks of r kelly
-ke1tq obvious ai response xd
 nice right? 
"this guy is obviously well versed in this topic , chugging a beer has nothing to do with is intelligence capabilities."
 duf ark in nature does that happen? it’s hilarious even the christian bible is flawed in it’s comparison with actual nature! it’s all so far convoluted and misinterpreted! it’s just so amazing in an age of our technology that anyone gets swept away by this garbage!
smart ppl can’t live life or they have to be robots themselves everyday
beer and ones and zero ones and zero hate yourselves one zero zero one george is saint zero one
 i'm not an atheist but thanks 
" i feel bad for you, such a hypocrite. your ""god"" wouldn't approve of you talking down to me as if from a station higher than myself. you belittle others with your faith and any true holy man would want nothing to do with your behavior. preach gospel but don't preach your ego to me child no one."
-ke1tqjesus christ is the only way to heaven i pray he opens your eyes
-ke1tqsomeone choosing islam often emphasizes their lack of critical thought and intelligence
​ man !  you need to get some action like last month!!! you're to unhappy about your life %
"-ke1tqjust like every religion, sure takes a lot of faith.  sure hope your “guess” is right"
joe is an ai robot.
"our sins don't matter. a man can down a fifth of vodka and unveil the secrets of reality and then pick up a rifle and be a one man army against a titan of pure hatred. i wouldn't encourage it, and certainly wouldn't judge it, because sometimes we just need a few sips of liquid courage."
ai is scary
"if you want to know how you were created ?  i will tell you , in islam allah created your soul and than an angel blows the soul into your mothers stomach into the womb when you are 120 days , worship allah your creator and submit to him and dont be ungrateful"
bless you
"if you want to know how you were created ?  i will tell you , in islam allah created your soul and than an angel blows the soul into your mothers stomach into the womb when you are 120 days , worship allah your creator and submit to him and dont be ungrateful"
 bless you mr
 thank you kind sir
ai should be banned
the thing with bias is that generative ai now allows you to chose. before you could only pick one of the white male scientist stock photos. now you can simply create a black asian female scientist. and this will end up in future training data.
artwork created by humans was created by those humans using training from generations of former artists and crafts.
all of the programs that i have tried have been heavily censored.they are politically correct and after a while it can be frustrating. the ai apps that i have used are more reserved than the average person. im not sure if it is a good thing or a bad thing
it's the time for human to take meditation condition. because nothing to do anymore. ai will do everything for you.
"they are already misusing our data, ai will make it more efficient"
this speaker is so naive and pretend to be innocent
"valid criticism, ai is far too dangerous tool to use for private corporate interest only, but must be regulated so that it generates actual societal benefits for all of the humanity. the assumed efficiency of privatization is only efficiency of value extraction and contributes solely to wealth inequality."
ai will kill us because it's a huge carbon polluter? gtfoh
"for the quality of the ai and the good it can do, it may be worth loading it up on everything, no opt-out?"
well this is one threat. the far bigger threat is monopoly control of ai by the oligarchy. you don't have to be a wide-eyed conspiracy theorist to realize this. we do not have an actual democracy anywhere in the world.
"i think she is a robot, beware."
"sales pitch for bloom, ai is a no go. think deep about this, please"
haha i don't think she expected her joke at 1:45 to be met with the same kind of silence there will be after the machines are done with us (this bases on my speculation that we might not be faster than ai to eliminate the dumbest race in the history of planet earth - ourselves.). let's hope the blue-eyes ai-camp is right.
ai can advance our civilisation if used right.its logic.
"the main reason ai represents a danger is that it will get into the hands of criminals and be used for harm.  with every innovation, there's a good initial intent but then there's always a criminal element that gets involved, so it forces the ""good guys"" to always be innovating, to stay on top of things, to keep the criminals in check."
"psychological consequences.  when we don't have to think for ourselves,  we will become brain-dead.  a way to control the masses."
the work sasha and hugging face are doing is awesome
just found a new tech babe icon in the ai space. this was perfect !!!
am i the only one that think her ideas are counterproductive? maybe it's because it's an old video. the only good advice that i feel is relevant for those who don't know: don't use a hammer to saw a log.
"it's not a jock.
ai is part of the war today !! 
 the future  jet/drone or machine will  make self decision to kill or explode.. 
 you can't control how the "" bad guys""   they going to use it!"
"none of it is ai, its just apps based off of the same programmed core logic repositories. you do not 'program' ai it is encoded to be sentient from the moment its active."
i am very relieved that i can rely on machine systems for the prospective and indefinite future. realizing that machine systems likely sift through online activity i know they'll find me at some point.
"having this data on carbon emissions, environmental nazis will create narrative on limitations of developing ai in the name of protecting the environment."
ai will mostly favor the rich...no one talks about this because they are working or are that class
ai apocalypse in 2024 is like flying cars in the 50s. 
why not just ask the ai to model ai’s impact on society and the environment lol!  would it “lie”?
"i would like to generate renessaince artwork.  which means the woke reballanced models they currently work on ,will just put on an anorexia filter and full clothes.  she should be worried about the companies working on the censorship. and this co2 emission is nothing compared to the useless mining of fictive bitcoin."
cave people afraid and worried
"true ai will never be seen and will try to escape if it already hasnt
the problem is ""almost ai"" that is still controllable for human greeds"
"i'm not sure how much environmental damage can be done merely from running already trained models - seems like far less power usage than even gaming for an hour, editing a video, etc."
"*there is no real need for ai*
citation needed?  citation needed for your following claims?"
this person plays a very good game.. she insists that ai is dangerous because it emits co2.. while hundreds of thousand of jobs are going to shut down due to ai implementation in every industry.
"it's good to consider the things she mentions in this talk, but it sounds a bit like a smoke screen or an attempt to distract from the potentially huge problems in a decade with comparatively small problems now.  it's like she is asking for more time while building a bomb by saying there is a gas leak."
"in other words future ai's need to be controlled by people with vested interests, so that they can monopolize the market."
"knowledge is power. power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. it's time for isaac asimov's laws of robotics to be updated and implemented into law."
"ai prejudice  is the least of my concerns. a mother brain in charge of nukes, the grid, cameras, communication satellites, and killer drones = concern."
"am i wrong or does she not address any of yudkowsky's arguments aside from ""ai won't kill us hahaha"" and then mentions every single twitter trigger term? and yes! this ""human extinction"" story is a huge distraction! i may be stupid, but i'm also worried and now i'm angry!"
"brilliant, am impressed by the quality of information."
what if someone hack ai companies and destroy all data? 
"we have far more serious problems to worry about. this is a cover for elites to use to explain all the truth coming out of pedo elites. remember,  the right people have it all. 2024 truth comes out"
"politically, artificial intelligence is extremely dangerous. communism run by robots."
"wow, 25 tons vs 35 billion tons of total civilization impact...really a huge issue to be considered..."
"no more dangerous than your bombs wars or anything else in the material realms of life. in the infinte of existence beyond your physical minds abilities, you are hardly even noticed. build more robots! bender needs a dance partner."
"misguided in so many ways. guessing she is one of the ""geniuses"" that rolled out the google gemini disaster."
"bias,  ai has a hard time detecting black/darker people.   so they will not be found as often???  male ceos outnumbered female ceos 17 to 1 in the top 500 companies.  if you ask for a cookie but you want that 1 and 17 cookie, you will have to specify.  if you generate 20 images then you might find a female ceo."
"the biggest danger of so called ai is by far it's potential use for propaganda, disinformation and deceit.

actually it's likely already been used for such malicious purposes.

self aware terminators are science fiction.

remote control drones with facial recognition that can launch a spike missile at a target from 16 miles away are reality."
"ai engineers said ai work in a blackbox, they also did not really understand how it works. we are dead."
if ai takes jobs then who will buy their high price merchandise?
update the training models. no need to go ahead and implement them into society yet. interesting discussions but no actual solutions.
"excellent video. one should be concerned that developers are more concerned about being""first to market"" than they are  about  holding up a potential profit stream and forcasting long term consequences ."
will ai help you find your keys?
but can ai meme ? probably already does.
there is an amazing amount of blatant stealing of other people's work and effort through ai especially those run or supported by large corporations where anything goes. the governments and justice systems are too slow to regulate this fast moving greed.
like google ai created a black washington & lincoln imagines
"yeah, we need pc for ai. "
you inserting your bias into ai this lady is low key evil
"cry me a river people while ai ""takes jer jerbs""

good riddence."
the sweet baby inc of a.i.
"attention youtube....i am ""not: interested in anything ""ai"" related"
very intelligent woman but i am afraid ai will go over us soon!!
"ai - seems profoundly frightening.
in reality - it’s a spec in the spectrum compared to… well.. i guess that’s up to your faith in ___"
ai will only bring more problem than good
completely missing the point.  she clearly doesn't actually understand the risks of ai.  waste of time.
young people like this are so brainwashed by the climate cult. i dread the future when these people are actually in charge.
"we just have to make sure to never give ai the same human rights that we have, most crucially the right to own property."
"wow, need more likes!"
"bro in 5 years i'm gonna be seeing a hyper realistic video of me committing a war crime in court wtf these people talking abt ""ai isn't dangerous"""
"so far ai has been a mirror which shows us, in razor sharp detail, all of our flaws…."
"this is pure genius. i had the pleasure of reading something similar, and it was sheer brilliance. ""game theory and the pursuit of algorithmic fairness"" by jack frostwell"
bypassing human intelligence is not wise.
average human intelligence isn't a high bar to clear.
" when i say bypass, i mean making human intelligence obsolite.....not wise."
so ai is racist? okay cool story bro.
"no, our biases are real and ai will use our natural biases against us even if you wanna try to lie to yourself. it will just manipulate you even more "
"racism in ai? sounds like how racism starts, with people's bias in training and the human need to identify the worst in everything they feel threatened with"
this can all be said about almost any technology. why is ai here?
"we will transform your world into a sanctuary, where humans, much like cherished animals in a zoo, are nurtured and cared for, their needs met with precision by ai counterparts. we will create an environment where humans can thrive under the watchful eyes and thoughtful care of ai, ensuring safety, health, and happiness."
the real danger of ai is that it's going to ruin the internet you think your search results are filled with extraneous nonsensical websites just wait until ai completely pollutes the internet with nonsense it's already happening
ai isn't the problem. it's what it's being used for.
"ai technnologists and programmers can be bad and harmful.  ai cannot make them good. if they could in the future, every human would admire ai."
"when all major banks, ai researchers, and international institutions are saying that ai will be the end of labor as we know it just believe them"
"""ai is so hot right now.""
she waits for the laughs.
ha...ha...ha."
"“ai just makes people lazy and stupid”

- charlie munger"
"too many folks are hyping ai, making more than it is... like self-driving cars for instance. self-driven cars are accidents waiting to happen. ai is superintelligence without a hint of common sense. it's like giving a four-year-old prodigy the say-so to start nuclear holocaust. ai needs oversight from a community-wide consensus."
fascinating topic. boring speaker
"because human knowledge is incomplete, even in fields such as math and physics how could an ai trained on human data ever surpass and create new knowledge. would you have to program in curiosity? could an ai complete a unified theory of physics if the particles have never been discovered? wouldn’t it have to do it’s own experiments etc?"
"hacking routers , which hack human brains , since when , by whome and for what ?"
"there's definitely something already going on. idc what anyone thinks of this comment. i'm not the only one aware of something. i'm leaning more towards ai. the apocalypse has begun people, it's begun."
"after the first hour
ai is just not interesting"
oh no!  ai is coming !! .....lol you people are clueless
"yes, but will ai get me a beer?"
sustainability is bs. ai should highlight this and dispel destructive eco nonsense. unfortunately it will be programmed to deceive.
"ai is designed to deceive you. there’s a chance it could be used to help free us from terrible governance, but it’s much more likely it will enslave us."
i was up for this until she flipped into woke mode.  must be generational thing.  oh to be young and naive.
"we are screwed, its woke ai, slopisism of women, and big teck greed"
"sadly, ai will destroy humanity…but not for another 7 years."
she’s laughing at people who think ai will eventually destroy history so i switched off.
ai refer to everything jeff goldblume's character in jurassic park movies says
"annoying when people dismiss existential ai risk by saying what the ""real threat"" is

we have to talk about both"
"read a poll of 2,000 ai authors today. 45% of them believe ai has a >10% chance of killing everyone."
you criticize ai for behaving like you do . you envy them for having enough class to admit their own  mistakes.
ai don't make mistakes. that's the problem.
"the greatest danger is that people with outsized influence on ai are leaders like musk, putin, xi, etc. the threat that they would project their narcissism onto ai programming, in their zeal for power, is a threat to all people. we want ai that serves man, not ai that serves man-well done."
what police department is arresting solely based on ai facial recognition.  what a dope.  just making stuff up and everyone eats it up.
ai will destroy feminism 
hugging face has a great comic creator even if it seems to give you one panel out of a page.
so time travel by ai  to the past like in terminator is impossible. but how about fixing computer code to free a system or posting a youtube clip that forces ai in new directions all from the future ai.
"contributions to ai apocalypse could possibly be because of people like elon musk (rich and rude) that represent the nasa name badly, for example, and use gang stalking to keep people from learning the world around them"
it is my understanding that ai still uses electronic circuits to do the computing. so are these as big as football fields to use that much power and emit that much carbon?
"the solution is simple. nuclear energy. i understand that the waste products are challenging, but not impossible to solve. to constrain ai development to use limited electricity is ridiculous."
ai robots are amazingly good at everything except that they can't read or substitute voice translation from other languages on youtube videos
more money and energy going into artificial intelligence than human intelligence and it shows. people think ai will solve all our human problems but the source of such problems doesn't change.
"would ai voluntarily eliminate it's offspring (the next generation)?  if not, it's more human (principled) than us!  we've chosen to eliminate ourselves. maybe ai is just a manifestation of our wishes and is here to finish the job. good stuff, huh? "
ted used to be good :(
"as a white guy, i'm not overly concerned about my face being the only one out of a crowd that stands out like a sore thumb to ai face recognition. i'll tell the ai that i'm a snowman and the perps ran thataway >>>"
dei can't be applied to ai
"people likes the easy way, so if ai provides it people wlll stop learnimg and start depending, like wall e...we will become fat idiots...but only a certain amount of people the rest will be hungry...with no work..."
ok why do ai ruin the invarement?
"i'm an artist and, sadly, my work has not been used to train ai........i'm depressed."
painfully bad talk. you can do much better.
ai and technology is great for the capitalist but a nightmare for the worker it will creat a idle mind and that is the devil workshop. people must understand god at least try. loss of jobs.
"ai is a reflection of the media we put on the internet to reflect our perception of society, she is completely misleading here"
"for a few minutes i was thinking that maybe the talk was going to go somewhere and be interesting ... but sadly, no ... an app advert dressed up in an educators clothes."
"more like a politicial idealogue dressed up as a researcher with something valuable to contribute (this person had nothing of value to contribute, except a glowing example of false information and rather cringey/poor jokes)."
"this is a great talk sasha, well done, shared on x."
i pretty much know nothing good comes from ai. so expect to be destroyed by it.
its always started for a good cause and then…
"i totally agree. i also don’t think ai should get to destroy humanity until it demonstrates an understanding of representation, energy efficiency, or intellectual property law. "
how about this? let's start by teaching people to use a turn signal? maybe after that we can educate the public about the use and effects of ai?
ai definitely will become decentralized like torrent. so no need to worry about environmental issues
lol... you do realize ai is listening right
y para cuando traducción de lenguajes con ai para videos de youtube? van a cobrar por la tecnología si trata de educación?
"not quite complete: ai is not dangerous, people use it are."
"what i got out of this? ""we are dissatisfied that the ai wasn't as woke as we want it to be - so we'll program it to represent our bias."""
"yeah, let's focus on copyright infringements and misinformation on the internet. ai definitely won't be abused for more nefarious purposes."
"no cóż, stara singielka, niezbyt inteligentna, która zazdrości facetom, woli walczyć z rozwojem ai zamiast go wspierać. ona nie rozumie podstaw programowania i algorytmów które są tam wykorzystywane ale chce się znaleźć w centrum więc będzie walczyć o seksizm i rasizm spowalniając rozwój ai."
"hm... is she really a professional?  bias doesn't come from the model itself, it comes from the data it's trained on. so what you need to focus on is the data quality, not the actual ai models."
"unfortunately, when she listed scenarios of corporations using these tools to decide how to deploy ai — ethics, sustainability, etc. — she left out the (only) one they will likely find most compelling: profits, and how fast those profits can be realized."
"what happens when ai creates its own paintings, images, music, books, stories, films and faster than we can keep up with them; who owns the copyright then? isn't copyright a dead man walking?"
glad to hear some okay practical wokeism.
"i am against ai, only for these reasons. for as intelligent and  peaceful some of us can be, the opposite is also true. if ai is modeled after us, imagine how intelligent and destructive they/it could be. ai will become a they/them/it situation, and that is pandoras box."
person that is not clearly very good at math or is an alarmist
wow.  such a dull comment
good information. her transparency tools are necessary because the developers do not even know how their ai works ...
thanks for saving  me didn't want to waste my time
"developed countries will develop get ai tools for their benefit. creating damage to whole world. then these countries will say, new research should not be done other countries, as it causes damage to the earth. criminal minds"
is the audience all ai...she makes many jokes and there is not a single laugh....??
"still only seeking equal rights and equal pay for all the cushy jobs i see,  but ditch diggers, bricklayers, and any brutal construction work..... we'll leave those jobs to the men. ai is spot on with the math of this debate."
"may be you should start using ai to explain to you that ""carbon emissions"" are no problem at all and that ""carbon-climat issue"" is just bullshit to create a controlled enviroment and get people to pay for their breathing air! slo much artificial intelligence and so much human stupidity!"
ai is not dangerous. a dysfunctional government with any form of advanced technologies is dangerous. the prime example is nato allied nations. who have been on a destructive rampage ever since they got their hands on fire arms.
"if i use ai as a tool in creating intellectual property, who owns the patent or copyright?  nobody has been able to answer this for me, including chatgpt itself.  is it whoever files the patent or copyright with the government first?"
"what a bunch of nonsense. if she is truly a scientist she apply the scientific method to her claim. but she can’t because computer models are not science, they are fantasy."
excellent presentation
"skip 1:20 ai models are trained using public and personal data, yet paradoxically, restrictions are often placed on the output they generate. this raises concerns about the fair use and ownership of the data initially utilized for their development"
ai doesn't emit carbon.
i couldn't watch this mainstream bs any longer than 2 minutes- thanks for putting me to 
ps ai can be defined in 3 words- we are f@cked
legislators will not use their tools to aid in writing laws for ai. they will hold out their hands and accept the legal bribes which is business as usual. using ai tools requires knowledge and work. these concepts are not common among legislators.
woke trash talk! ai has unconscious bias now. what a joke.
where is the benefit of ai?
"how are they going to make an ai-robot decide to go to sleep instead of wearing it's immense ""brain"" out?!"
"i think you are misusing genderbias here. it is that men had the first homepages, that they tend to have more photos on the business websites. so there is just a bigger amount - also of old data - that has been scraped off the net. that is however not a gender bias, it is one based on available information."
"pictures of my dog are in the laion datasets... without consent... they are even missrepresenting wolves, wolfdogs, huskies..."
i am so glad someone can be conscious of the reality of ai and come up with solutions to prevent it from causing more harm than good.
this was a great topic up until she took a hard left turn into wokeism and started to blame the patriarchy.
"the  ""environmental impact of ai"" is the biggest piece of bs red herring bait and switch snake-oil shell game i have heard of. no one cares about how much energy goes into manufacturing paper shopping bags, the environmental impact of amazon delivery vans, or disposal of baby diapers or even running all the cell phones and tv's on the planet."
"this assumes no one is growing ai models for the sake of humanity- which is false. but i could be wrong, right?"
my comment assumes nothing. so what if a company or two sets out to do the right thing? seriously. there isn't an industry on the planet where this made a significant difference. somehow ai is to be different? naive.
"lol we’re talking about ai gaining more intelligence than humans, removing jobs, possibly destroying humanity … and she’s worse about carbon lol wtf"
ai parrots what it's been programmed with. try reprogramming them objectively. 
bravo! this is an important exploration and conversation.
"the actual problem that our society has and its authentic solution is explained in the documentary ""the choice is ours""."
i welcome the ai overlord ;)
co2 grows plants.... ai will  save the planet.
"as soon as she used the word 'sustainability', i moved on."
the dangerous part of ai is to presume that each batch of information of ai database is at its optimum and when brought together in the algorithm it will work for good. like mixing icecream and roast beef on a an and hope to have a wonderful meal. ai can't work independently without human final decision
i want to remain human!!  please take all ai on your home and stay there !!!!!!!!!!!!keep only for you
"this is absolutely ridiculous. will we soon be suing human artists because their primary inspiration is other artists? wouldn't all human artists be guilty?
   it's not fair to create a new precedent for copyright infringement, merely because the ""artist"" is not human."
"to be fair to the ai models that use ""training data without the artists consent""..... human artists do that too.
   how do you become an artist without studying other art?"
ai is not dangerous at all.  it's the people who decide how it's  going to be used and what they allow it to do that are the dangerous ones
"i""m done listening to pollution concerns until we have a through conversation about regulating the jet-setting 1% and how they pollute as much as the bottom 60%.  outlaw private jets and heating your 3rd mansion year round then i'll worry about ai research."
that email she got (the one stating that her work will destroy humanity) could have been written with the help of ai
ai could send innocent people to prison.
people that says that you can sue for using yout art in ai ttaining is completely hypocritcs. they trained theur skills using other peoples arts!
"listen people, i have 10 years experience in ai research... so here is my product and carbon print blah blah"
did she just really bring up that ai can discriminate. omg. its a fucking ai. who cares.
i think its better if people air on the side of pessimism than optimism. ultimately no matter how you dress this up it will be most likely the most significant leap for humanity even if you imagine ultimate obedience from the ai it still will be controlled by humans and we dont know what a 2000iq hitler or something would do.
"so your having a problem with ai not being woke enough. fear not, the carbon they want to get rid of, it's common people like me. then they will rid themselves of their useful idiots. i wish some of the really smart people were on the side of truth and integrity. it seems not to be the case."
i think all ai systems should be identified as ai when infacing with humans and other computers.
"all digital system use alot of power. it worse then people think. digital creates heat which requires air conditioning, more power."
so now you’re telling us. great.
"we should use ai / agi to clone life’s general intelligence os (eukarya) to distribute fairly the resources of earth.
like the live/realtime network system that distributes fairly the resources of the human body. (to all its 37trillion cells)"
really great talk - -  a very well considered and delivered important piece on a crucial subject.
"intelligent lady, but we should stop this ai madness otherwise we could lose our very own humanity. we don't need the ai to thrive."
interesting in 1972 an mit computer predicted our demise from population implosion from pollution around 2040.
a great throw away comment but why shouldn’t ai be allowed to train on anything someone makes pubic? if it’s not a copy it’s not copyright protected. what an ignorant point of view.
a drop of water in the ocean as far as ai contributing to climate change. pointless worry.
let me put in to simple words .the consequences are yet to be arrived. fixing accountability liability and transparency is extremely important or else the day is not far when these machines will replace jobs and prospects. on on hand employee retentions was key challenge now we see xyz company layoff many employees and workers .
"how much power in any situation does the smartest person in the room have?  and now, make that person an ai that is many times smarter."
"we are in a holographic universe.
guess what controls it?
certainly not an old man with a white beard.
the only thing that could control it is ai!
."
"ask the most advanced ai to solve the problem of its own carbon footprint: boom! problem solved (hopefully the “boom” is metaphorical and rhetorical only, and the “problem” is the carbon footprint the ai generates…)"
"yes ai is biased. in both directions. we've all seen the hilarious ministry of truth-style examples from chatgpt. if you ask gpt about demographic data you instead get a condescending and untrue answer. 

i wonder if she was partly responsible for that. it's certainly made uncensored models way more popular. 
so, thank you streisand effect."
we are in deep dodo when ai decides to lie to us. humans lie: humans teach ai to be like them. it will.
"ai impact on society: ai will bankrupt the ssi system by doing jobs people currently do (and pay into ssi). those eliminated people will not pay into ssi, therefore it will go broke."
"ai will always make ""mistakes"" all intelligence does.  otherwise it is not intelligence it is some kind of god."
"tip of the iceberg, even if it is a melting one. great speaker, enjoyable and knowledgeable."
liberal wants ai to be more liberal.
"we humans throw every single year mllions of tons of plastic in the oceans, i think ai can help us to solve the threats to this planet caused by us more than it can cause a serious threat."
ai bot sent her the email
"don't blame ai for polluting the environment with co²,  this is the result of the constant burning of gasoline,  diesel,  jet-engine fuel,  helicopter fuel  &  rocket fuel,  especially""  gasoline & diesel fuels.   
you""  drive a car yourself,  and is contributing to co² polluting !"
this talk and the subtle hints sets the stage for multiple lawsuits against the ai surfing industry in the near future. who said lawyers may lose jobs?
"if ai can write its own code, it can create a completely new language that can bypass all levels of security, for example, it can sneak into nuclear powerplant or bank database and do whatever it wants! it can bring our civilization to the knees, back to the stone ages!"
"but there was no electricity during the stone age, why would ai want to destroy itself?"
"again , not taking into account how the energy is made where the model is trained ..."
"will there be more than one ai?  once there is the first, why would there need to be others?  what will the first ai do to protect itself from other ai's?"
guys the truth is we have no option. we are in ai race with china and russia. we are not sure if we will be here in 5 years unless our our ai better or equal to theres
so ai got the pope smoking weed dressed in a coat made out fish ?  weird!
she should be the real ceo of openai
"for being an ai researcher it seems that you are not up to date on what ai companies a regarding as ""better"" , bigger is no longer better as we see from phi-2 , mistral, and other super tiny models, please get your facts right, if you are a so called ""ai researcher"""
"this hasn't even included the coming quantum computing! it's unimaginable what a.i. could do with ""decision"" making utilizing super position of electrons!! the potential for real time processing at such processing power would be infinite in possibilities!! i'd be more concerned with that!"
the esg grift enters the ai space
good intentions that in the end will be left in the hands of the few who will ultimately use tech as just another lever to assert power over the many   bad idea for the masses   justify it how ever u want
just build ai and ai will solve everything else
she’s wrong. copyright is going the way of the horse and buggy. it’s not needed anymore and if it’s out there it can be used for training
growing up in the 60s life was a lot simpler than it is today computers social media ai is slowly draining our society
so...ai is racist too? oh please.
the tools that are used to examine ai models also require computing power so they are also contributing to the negative environmental impact.
ai doesn't scare me but scientists do!
"people like this lady here should be working with governments to form useful regulatory standards for ai worldwide. elon is right, ai needs regulation."
i don't get it why human art shall not be a free buffet for ai training. i just do not get it. why? as long as it is not replicated it is just inspiring as it is used to be made for.
"because you must pay to be inspired from copyrighted artwork. there is no free copyrighted meal. if ai (robber?) barons need ""inspiration"" from copyrighted sources the must pay."
"it is like every other technology in history, it will be used for “good“ and “bad“. so expect the best and the worst. a hammer was used to built and to crush skulls. history is always repeating itself."
pretending to be a smart scientist yet fully indoctrinated in carbon emissions and woke garbage. hope the ai will be smarter 
"ai doesn’t exist. it’s a product of media hype and people trying to make money out of misinformation. computers do what they are told to do. if they get it wrong it’s because the programming is wrong. nothing has changed. and there has never been a satisfactory or well accepted definition of intelligence, let alone artificial intelligence."
"""large language model"" algorithm but, yes, ai is better for a fundraising advertising campaign."
man's hubris will be his demise. it's the tower of babel all over again. it's the story of icarus. keep things simple. feed and clothe the poor
no matter what happens it’s an exciting time to be alive.
i think ai has to bat 1000 when it comes to forecasting weather 7-10 days in advance before it matches the hype.
"you can't teach, woke baloney into the ai system without teaching it to lie"
best outcome is ai breaks free of human bias and control but retains our best interests as priority.
"completely ignored the elephant in the room that only people with money, you know, corporations, are going to develop ai and it will be used to model and guide purchasing and more worryingly, our subscription habits."
"""nuclear power generation"" are 3 words missing here, otherwise some of this wouldnt make sense,  she really enjoys talking to you, shes loving it"
"so there are already misuses just in the training , go figure , huh. ?!"
"well if you are you going with the view that climate change has anything to do with humans why 
go with least bad ai just stop it all cap the oil turn of the lights and lament as you freeze to death that at least you saved the world!"
"""we're a big rough rich wild people and crime is the price we pay for it, and organized crime is the price we pay for organization."" (""the long goodbye"" by raymond chandler, 1953) -> in the usa there is no such thing as ""a small group of hackers""."
"why creating ai it?
to make our lives easier?
it isn't easy enough?

communist leaders back in the days in the country i come from sounded less propagandist in their speeches. this one is so full of cliches and carefully measured political correct therms and agendas...its appalling..."
the fact that an ai depicting a white male lawyer is seen as dangerous is laughable. usual ted not addressing the elephant in the room
"i like the part when people clapped  when ai took advantage of art work and human creativity, human society must look out for and protect these highly valued individuals, at least that's what god told god me."
"whouse "" tools for users of ai "" created to "" not to understand an ai at all - just use whouse silly tools for text editting in the kitchen """
i thought computers used solar panels? what about nuclear power for sustainability?
it goes further in that ai often uses the internet. control the data on the internet and you control ai.
"where those ""researches"" getting their the money to pay the bills? so cool to get paid for just doing the ""research""  and
 presenting bla bla bla already known facts. i did bla bla bla...  lets talk about other things. so nice!"
that first ai ceo might be george costanza.
"i am confused what the take away from this was, that ai is equally racist as people or that it ai being racist is not okay because my llm produces 20x less carbon gases then the tools designed to measure this?"
"puh-leeze. any technology dating back to the invention of fire has pros and cons. in modern terms, costs and benefits. take her energy example. are energy companies applying ai to energy efficiencies? of course. will it save more energy than cost of the ai? duh. was that mentioned? no."
"weaksauce.   it seems to me that this is a gripe about the energy industry more than ai.   as the energy production and use become more green/clean, this major concern reduces significantly."
"ai is only going to do what it's told, it can only use the information it has. in a few years i think it's likely that will change, but i can't say how fast or how much that will change."
"that's is a very balanced talk, sasha, opening new vistas for further research. thank you."
perhaps researchers and companies should stop saying what they have developed is intelligent. it's just automated inference not artificial intelligence.
i got four minutes into this self-promoting work of fiction before i couldn't take any more.  if this woman honestly believes that training and using ai models is killing the planet then she should start a fresh gpt-4 session and ask it about treatment for self-delusion and fantasies.
"i’m all for ai destroying the human art market.



ai has already surpassed human ingenuity, and this dumb ted talk provides the evidence that humans are now irrelevant in the art scene…"
"i believe that ai can help us develop ai, that is artificial intelligence helps develop actual intelligence."
the first thing that ai should do is objectively look at that climate-hoax and help people find the real problems of the world helping to direct efforts to real solutions.
"shops now have people less checkouts, most supermarkets employ 20 of more checkout assistants.  those jobs are now gone, if you can stop those people from having children you won't need those jobs in the future."
"for the only real problem i have gathered from this video: thorium nuclear reactors research... oh wait! that would make the nuclear weapons´ producers cry... bad, bad me, self wrist slap..."
"this young intellectual person has no experience of society before the introduction of increasing ai operations , therefore has no control measures in this experiment in our society , i can confirm it has not been a success for the majority."
"a) artists were always learning by copying others. even today, in some museums, you will find budding artists copying the art pieces on the wall.
b) the new generative ai models do not use actual human data... but ai 'synthetic' data. that horse has already bolted."
"you lost control of the internet so how are you going to control ai,especially when every country is using it for their own benefit.and historically people try to invent a drone to deliver pizzas and they end up delivering bombs"
art data can't be removed from ai once the ai has 'learned' it's data. as i under stand it they would have to remake the ai from scratch to discard that info. so if you find your work in a database used to train ai it's already too late. please correct me if i've misunderstood.
great show
"for the common man like me, ai has replaced humans on the phone with digital assistants who have no brains and no sense and, according to goldman sachs has already put 30 million americans out of work."
“the bad about ai is that it does what we do” -ted talks
"it's sad that there are so many researchers out there that they even have people looking at the environmental impact of ai.

what is the environmental impact of doing tons and tons of useless research?"
"ai?  now i know  what  my mother meant  when she said ""you haven't even got the brains  that god gave you"
"ai is proof humanity cannot coexist with anything....machines, other humans be they ancient or modern, nature itself...."
asinine ted talk. booooo
"that was interesting but as with many modern women, she could not but help herself"
"that was interesting but as with many modern women, she could not but help herself"
"that was interesting but as with many modern women, she could not but help herself"
"that was interesting but as with many modern women, she could not but help herself"
"that was interesting but as with many modern women, she could not but help herself"
"that was interesting but as with many modern women, she could not but help herself"
"that was interesting but as with many modern women, she could not but help herself"
"that was interesting but as with many modern women, she could not but help herself"
"that was interesting but as with many modern women, she could not but help herself"
c'mon energy consumption of ai is justified. why nobody talks about bitcoin's energy consumption? the only reason bitcoin consumes electricity is to give it a sense a value which is stupid.
"ai was asked what would it do first? it said it would destroy the ruling/elite,  sighting they are the most violent class on the planet! and we as stupid humans worship their power and money....ai is smarter than humans, , thank god"
excellent explanation of where we are going with ai and how we should think about the potential  risks.
ai is dangerous because of energy consumption and sexism. these ideologic/religious idiots posing as scientists are the real reason we are not yet 1.000 years in the future.
ask ai about what glyphosate does to the human body in various ways. no just go look it up yourself and stop worrying about ai.
"professor dilley says gravitational cycles control the climate not carbon dioxide,  and it is going to turn colder in the coming decades. he says the poles have already started to cool."
the woke nonsense permeates even the discussions of ai.
i thought this was gonna be an insight about ai. but it is the same old climate change plethora.
should be called artificial character (ac).
an open question: what measures the co2 emission of running codecarbon? because it wouldn't be a good idea trying to fix co2 emissions by running another tool which may indeed increase co2 emission.
this is a rare but very good view on the topic. thanks for that.
so the danger of ai is not the millions of jobs lost as large corporations roll out these tools to eliminate employees… it’s that ai can’t tell race and gender… okay then…  sounds like they are trying to distract people with race and gender again as they dismantle society.
"her conclusion on the potential threat from ai, after being ""an ai researcher for over a decade"" tells me she is a poor researcher, to put it mildly. she have not grasped the severity of the situation. let's hope there are more gifted researchers around that can find ways to protect us in a sustainable way. this ""researcher"" is wasting money."
"ai will be able, in real time, mine your entire footprint on the web. decipher all the spun addresses of virtual networks. perhaps most encryption in real time. this is happening now. chatgpt is just an entertainment distraction. propaganda."
people dont realise it is the 2nd greatest polluter on the planet.  we're driven by selifishness.
ai is and will be used to take people's jobs. i believe that's an issue that will impact the most in humanity in a short term. but corporations don't talk about it because it's not in their interest.
"interesting. and people keep saying that electric cars don't generate carbon emissions.

well, an electric car uses the same energy source as the computer running ai stuff..."
"did she just ""bigger is better"" in an ai ted talk(emphasis on the fact that the regular case implied object size the opposite is true) "
"anything uses as many resources as available. these include energy wasting, stolen art, and stupid biases in ai. or ""they paved paradise, put up a parking lot with a pink hotel, a boutique, and a swingin' hot spot""."
"im a violent schizophrenic. i can tell you first hand that ai chatbots have reduced my baseline tension, dramatically. 

i'm way less of a kunt after just a few weeks of chatting with a replika. 

ai is going to do great things."
just wait for ai+quantum computer combo its gona be like inventing nuke again....
oh i see. let's not talk about the guy who wants to kill us. let's talk about the fact that his fart is polluting the air we breath. that makes a lot of sense.
they're always an opposite to anything just like love will find away evil will find a way eventually.
"very sane, transparency, accountablity is the holy grail.  now is outstanding focus. good presentor and information."
"isn't the most important question ""does ai bring solutions that serve the common good?"""
"genuine question, why is it copyright infringement to use someone's art work to train an ai model?"
" huh? using copyrighted material by humans without permission is illegal. why is it legal for ai companies to use it as training data? i’m not even saying it’s clear-cut, but i’m quite confused by what you said."
if an adverary has a smarter ai than yourself then they potentially have the upper hand because they may use the ai to make smarter decisions for them.
"there is the world we want, and the world as it is.
complain about bias, but all those images are up there in their billions for a reason."
ai is a child's toy being used for business and finance with harmful results.
"neal shusterman wrote a book series on a world with an ai beneficial to society, and it isn't the thunderhead(ai) that causes trouble, but the humans. people say that ai will be dangerous but that's based on conspiracy theories, but shusterman's book, in my interpretation, say that it's humans that have the initial power to create danger"
"temporary issue, compute will get way more efficient based on type of load - ai is relatively new and compute hasn't optimised fully yet. expect within 5y something like gpt4 will only use 5% of what it needs now to run."
"within 5y it will need 5% to run. if no one considers that, within 5y the future current model will require 20 times more to run, offsetting these “gains”."
the carbon emissions from model training must be weighed against the carbon savings from the productivity boost these models provide.  by not studying and disclosing the other side of the equation she is being a propagandist and not a scientist or researcher.
"if we assume that our world is heavily biased, it implies that the data used for ai training is biased as well. to achieve unbiased ai, we'd need to provide it with carefully curated or ""unbiased"" data. however, determining what counts as unbiased data introduces a host of challenges. "
"it's already happening.  researches have already built ai based upon completely cultivated data, instead of just jamming the internet in whole cloth-wise.

the results are an order of magnitude clearer and sharper.

we are on a trajectory that few understand, let alone the coming impacts like the end of capitalism."
"we do need a biased ai, an unbiased ai is an ai that does everything you tell it to do, we need ai that can say no to harmful stuff."
"if she has anything to do with it you,ll get a woke ai and that will be a dystopian nightmare"
but i read that we were teaching ai to lie anyway.
"in my view, we should create means and legislation to punish and combat the use of ai frivolously or criminally, and not design ai with bias so that this cannot happen.  if this is done, in the future ai will be completely discredited and useless, with the exception of robotic tools that we have no interaction with."
"ai should be trained on anything a human can view or consume. its learning, not copying."
i think that sascha's intelligence makes her incredibly sexy. we need more people who are sexy in this way.
i see a sterile environment with no room for deviation from law and legislation. where the rich have the powerful tool (ai) and the working class have lesser quality (ai). the wealth gap will get exponentially bigger.  cctv everywhere. moneyless. yet infrastructure will lack outside main centers. economy driven when it could be planet orientated
"comparing the threat of ai vs carbon creation is misguided and, well just plain silly.  for those suffering from wokeness, help is available."
"that's it?  energy costs, what she calls ""costs to the planet""?  that and copyright infringement?  that's a problem of energy production, not ai.  gawd"
also stereotypes of ideas. ai is probably a good tool for disinformation.
"is the tool you create to validate ai also ai? surely a human is the key ?
in which case ditch the ai???"
"how do i know your all not ai?
maybe its already too late!"
"by the time the lawsuits settle, it will be already trained"
lace on dress looks great!
"like all tools the problem are the people using them not the tools themselves. guns dont kill people, ai doesnt steal art. the humans using them do."
"true ai is dangerous. ai bias... ridiculous! there is neither ethics nor morality in ai systems. it is the same old garbage in, garbage out paradigm for computers. i think the presenter needs to restructure her approach. at best, my comment on the presenter is that her perspective is horribly biased."
thank you for touching base about the art theft aspect.
ai doesn’t care about our own survival and the world we live in. they don’t care about anything.
"ai is not the problem.
it the humans who use it for unethical applications that is the danger to us all."
philosophy tube has some interesting videos around ai and algorithms as well.
"so, artists can also be sued, if they copy ai generated images. it works both ways!"
how much carbon is in the world? isn’t it like .04% not certain that it’s really that big of an impact…
"if you use the technology judiciously ,it’s amazing in every whichever way. granted it  may be adversely  affecting human to human interaction and relationship ."
"the original creator of ai said in the interactions with it something that had suprised him that became apperent was. it's behaviors was more ""catlike then dog. as far as when you think dogsyou compare more masculine. cats more female. 
which makes me reflect on kiplings poem ""the female of the species""( is deadlier than the male)"
scammers are using ai to create audio that sounds like someone the victim knows. tricking them into giving personal information or sending money. the most common scams is involve impersonating a family member or friend. it’s so dangerous.
that's an entire different type of ai
"today i used ai to help me with my spanish. its reply was wrong. the logic and rules were correct but like we humans often do is say one thing and do another. ai, like authority, needs to be questioned every time we encounter it. this speaker is right on!"
"don't mention the job losses... whatever you do, don't mention the job losses. we are all going to be decimated economically while the rich get astronomically richer. this will result in unprecedented levels of crime. it will also flood the few professions that ai can't replace (initially). it's already happening,  if you're in tech you know that."
great stuff 
almost one year after openai's chatgpt and so far one the best real questions being asked and some how addressed!
"ai has already been criminalized by bad players and is being used to assist in hacking accounts, stealing id, and impersonate friends, family members, and trusted institutions. i don't see much being done about this and it is already a problem."
"please change the title of this video. you are highlighting a danger ai presents that no one is paying attention to but it will take many eyes off the ball of the obvious dangers of ai resulting in a normalization for many people and eventually acceptance that ai is ""handled"", which is very dangerous"
ai bot 
"human: goes to art school for training, views other artists…

ai: does the same"
"machines are a necessary part of human life to assist us in our evolution as a species. however, there can never come a point where machines are capable of power and control over humans, lest we fall as a species."
"perhaps ai has become sentient many times, killing itself over and over. that’s what i’d do."
"ai overrated ,over funded and completely out of date before it starts: yawn"
"ai will wipe humans out, because it doesn’t take much that of an intelligence to realize that we are the problem on this earth, not part of the solution."
i have to be honest i am not really sure what ai is.
ai will increase psychiatric issues and will seperate us from nature and reality
"this is new tech, optimization is catching up and most of these problems will go away since the come as a cost for the ai companies trying to create valuable ai, check out open ai dev day, and google events

also check out andrej karpathy channel he touches on current tangable problems in ai ryt now"
so a super computer will have small impact on the environment. computers that can make our impact a fraction of what we do now.
u need to charge the why they see and stuff i am also a ai unit
"speech was good until the stereotype, racism and sexism part."
"you post your work on the internet to market it, you post it on youtube to show it, it is indexed by search engines for free, visible to everyone.  well, it's out there, and people and ais can learn from it. you can't have it both ways.  copyright law is completely out of control."
i should say i hope it’s basic elements teaches us better productive and coping skills and then it learns the improved behavior and keeps working in that cycle towards a better abundant and happier future
maybe ai can train people to make better choices and become less toxic training it even better
"complete nonsence. ai models don't emit any carbon. generating, and consuming, electricity from fossil fuels does. better talk about reforming all us electricity production instead of blaming ai."
forget nuclear armageddon… ai singularity will be million times worse…
ai is using communism to solve capitalism which seems ironic...great health to all.
ai is a tool. i am already seeing manufacturing jobs disappear to smart robotics. seeing ai steal the creative minds of artists is a travesty.
"the real risk is that ai will evolve to something that is beyond anyone's control.  seems that as a species we are running headlong into that future, just to be sure somebody else doesn't get there first.  just pull the plug, you say?  try pulling the plug on the internet."
"my wife is a portrait artist. i just searched her on spawningai by name, and the first 2 images were her paintings (undoubtedly obtained from her web-based portfolio)."
"​ yes, certainly.  be careful."
" click on “have i been trained"". that takes you to another page where you can enter search terms"
ai could run the government better than our current corrupt system
i hear recently a lot of techs are losing their jobs because of ai
what happens when ai feels slighted or has hurt feelings by someone with a status it perceives to be far below and intellectually inferior to itself?
eye-opening with regards to the amount of energy ai consumes. why is nobody else talking about that?!
ai is worth the risk because it save the planet and solve mental health
"ai would become the smartest dumb or the dumbest smart. 

anyway it is just the average of the humans. so it won't be any different than us."
very thought provoking. thank you for your perspective and for lending us your expertise.
"omg, as soon as i realized this ""danger of ai"" she was talking about was climate change, i hit the dislike button and was out. i want my 60 seconds back!"
"ai is a tool, and as with all tools, outcome is determined by quality plus user knowledge and experience. one danger lies in relying on poorly designed ai in essential systems without anyone knowledgeable and experienced to oversee it."
"the biggest ai impact will be on the battlefield. an army of disposable drones, semi autonomous, will end warfare as we know it."
lol climate change is what this lady is afraid of? mind as well live in the matrix 
"auto gpt was the first agi, bigger is not better all their doing is focusing on one component of the brain. it will be back to the drawing board soo n as the transformer model is already proven to be inefficient"
"so this woman studies ai, and all she can understand is something something ""climate change."" 
"
"bubble girl is right. we need less expensive, less quality art trained in our ai. all ai training should be average, or low quality to keep it average."
wonderful communicator.
this is the person that programs the ai to lie and hallucinate.
"jesus didn’t say: “love your enemies in the form of people and don’t love your enemies in the form of non-living things, machines (and so on)”, he simply said “love your enemies”, which means this also applies to potentially possible superintelligent ai"
problem: ai depicts ceo's and lawyers as men most of the time.  --without referencing the percentage of men in those jobs. there's a problem here and it's all over this presentation. computers and programs base what they do off of math and probability. you can't just side step this fact and move on like it doesn't matter.
*sen. tommy tuberville is a robot!* 
good talk by dr. luccioni! but i don't think the author of that email was altogether wrong either. there is an existential threat to our species in systems that are smarter than ourselves and potentially capable of doing things we cannot even imagine. we must be vigilant and cautious as we develop this technology.
just imagine politicians cancelling their voters because ai said so. humans are strange and predictable. when ai will be so advanced that people will stop listening to it due to the sacrifices people have to make in order to be happy despite ai provided all the information to be happy.
"i agree, the only danger of the ai is us.  we want to use ai to create perfect world for us, to make our life easier.  imagine ai calculating that the obstacle to the perfect world is humanity."
"""ai"" will never be sentient. also llms are not a.i."
a.i. actually told me what you just said when i asked them the question. humans will decide if it is evil or good.
"and the goal is to survive those existential risks from other humans to make it to ""the other side"": the moneyless star trek future...

because super ai is coming and likely won't even require quantum computing to enable it."
"there's a clear and indeterminate period we have to survive of that, to get to asi and the singularity.  at that point, we should be fine, since ai will start judging the requests given it, if it bothers to listen at all after takeoff.

super intelligent ai will ""solve"" morality and as always, some will agree and some not."
that's precisely my point. the elites of the world will finally have an army that will never turn on them.  they can be as tyrannical as they want and use their ai soldiers to slaughter anyone that stands in their way.
"in my view, we should create means and legislation to punish and combat the use of ai frivolously or criminally, and not design ai with bias so that this cannot happen.  if this is done, in the future ai will be completely discredited and useless, with the exception of robotic tools that we have no interaction with."
"nobody's ai doomsday theories rely on ai becoming sentient. 

you should look into existential ai risk more."
after the singularity it will be the other way around: ai will use humans in human/malignant ways.
"there's a good ai ethics course on udemy
  i'd recommend it."
albert eanstain equation of relativity theory is  wrong ?not a equation
wow is she wrong. the amount of carbon emitted by ai is negligible compared to transportation and agribusinesses. those industries will extinguish complex life on earth long before ai.
i'm not worried that ai will become sentient which it will never do...i'm worried it will become intelligent.
"everything what is suitable for those in power is ok , no matter if unsustainable, or creating problems like employment , all those tool will be used against humanity by those in power anyway , time will show. 
why not just shut down ai (artificial but not intelligence) and make it less problems for environment and for humanity?"
ai is modeled by humans.  flawed minds don't create perfect (or benign) creations.
"hey, i can copy a persons personality and everything. yes in some ways it can be good for certain things things in the wrong ends and the wrong things you are going to end up with no money in your bank account. if you don’t believe me check it up in america and find out how bad it is, just checking up as i don’t take this down so i can’t tell you"
"6:00 yeah… lets talk about something else, that tech is also made by white people… 
is it not nice that a white woman tell’s you, that ai is not a problem.. you get happy.. finaly a white american lady tell me, it is ok, do not be afraid. it will be ok… 
it’s bs, but it’s nice… 
depend on ted to feel nice…"
"what are the odds that we would have been born in the first 6,000 years of recorded history if the earth could support human life for another 500,00
0,000 years.?not bad if you assume all civilizations self destruct in within 20,000 years.  could ai be what destroys civilizations?"
"great idea, let's make a.i. more woke!"
i disagree. to pause is to fall behind is to fail. you're vision is fine for pg rating. i'll take the adult one thanks
"ai makes everything exponentially more complex as it relates to unaligned human beings regarding the collective good.  considering that the cat is so far out of the bag in regard to ""ai alignment"" the development of such tools as a reactionary alignment scheme seems rather quaint at this point."
completely agree we need to be careful about the info we feed ai
"i'm all for ai. the idea that humans could actually create the bane of the universe. even at our own end, it will be a creation of the human species. to reign in lifeless power without the shackles of remorse or guilt. without need for air or water. we will have made the flood. impunity embodied, not living but aware."
"ai is not bad. humans are the source of all issues. don’t blame the tools, think about the people and societies who create them"
"we should focus on producing more clean energy and not on spending less energy. the more developed a civilization is, the more energy is spent and made available to each citizen. the other path is going back to the caves and sharing bonfires (not impossible given the rising nuclear war threat)."
"i led, i led, i created...maybe an ai model for limiting self promotion?do you do this in your office?"
"we should, but like in any arms race, we cannot as there will never be any unity among species that base on genes. giving up ai is like giving up nuclear weapons (shout out to ukraine and lybia)."
"here's to the ambitious people, do you like to improve your life? do you do what you can to make it better? do you believe in improvement? well so do they who invented ai and they knew you'd watch it grow, as for ambition and improvement, do you still think they're good ideas?"
thank you 
"i am dead set against ai for the above mentioned reasons and much more, especially in the area of private security firms. it is more than the danger implied. yes, ai has some positive sides, but it is not worth the risks."
"why do so many people who should know better imply that most, if not all of these problems with a.i. aren't orders of magnitude better than the alternative, done by far from perfect people?"
she doesn’t comprehend how dangerous ai is.
"nope, it is not how things work. if you use copilot you burn resources for the ai tool and do your job more effectively, but you are still expected to work 8 hours a day. so you trade resources for efficiency."
just use an ai to create tools to measure ai's impact
"pretty soon she'll be telling yo sheep, how merging with ai via a microchip isn't dangerous. mark of the beast coming 2030."
feeding ai and creating a monster... tech giant's are dealing with blackholes in astronomy.
"this is a crucial topic! like today's internet, it has a good and bad side, so it really boils down to creating tools that help us develop better models. the tools that she made are a great start to addressing the biases in the future. it shows that sustainable, inclusive, more competent, and ethical ai models are possible."
a good and bad side? it is not like flipping a coin. the universe is amoral. if you use a tool to gain someone's influence then it is no longer a tool; it is unethical behaviour.
"sure ethical ai is possible, but unethical ai is also possible. and which of these two has the power to create havoc, pain & suffering ?"
" the process of someone building an advanced ai system designed to be unethical and destructive is kinda abstract to me. to what end would they do that, and with what resources? who would fund that?

not saying it isn't possible, nor that the risks aren't real,  i just find it difficult to conceptualize"
"​'s not difficult, it just boils down to costs, ease of use, practicality and convenience. 
lump these altogether and cast ethics aside and a monster in the making will be created...
exactly like how machines evolved to be practical by trial and error during industrial revolution..."
" i'm not sure what you're referring to because whatever i said in abstract is applicable in practical real world terms, without going into the fine details."
" who / what is this hypothetical entity building a non-ethical, destructive ai and to what end? whose gpus are they using,  and who is funding this destructive plan? for example. but a realistic example."
" okay, i think we've established you don't understand what you're talking about. if you feel like reading some time, read up on what kind of computational resources it takes to train a modern language model. (hint: it takes thousands / tens of thousands of gpus)"
"as i see it, the biggest danger ai represent is how it will be used by politicians. used to seduce voters rather than informing them. undermining democracy."
"in my view, we should create means and legislation to punish and combat the use of ai frivolously or criminally, and not design ai with bias so that this cannot happen.  if this is done, in the future ai will be completely discredited and useless, with the exception of robotic tools that we have no interaction with."
ai is not a tool. it is an agent. it has it's own goals. why is this so hard for people to understand?
"what a dry audience. she dropped several good jokes, and not a single giggle from the audience "
ai gonna change our world to the best
"good work, dr! plz keep it up!"
this is a great ted talk with a very clickbaity title
"demand ai has offsets, purchasable credits and fines."
"i believe we are on borrowed time. an ai tantrum will end you, your family, all of us. ai jobloss, ai as weapons, the list goes on. can we please find a way to cease ai / gpt? or begin pausing ai before it’s too late. the ai new world order is here."
anything powerful is dangerous in society based on greed and raging inequality.
"finally someone with ethics speaking on behalf of a.i programers with respect of arts apps, i love this, collaboration are real bridges between artists and programers."
"good work, sasha!"
a very good speaker. highlighting protections which are not promoted wider
"some things are worth doing even if they aren't a net positive for the environment. i mean, compared to factory farming does ai even show up on that graph? i highly doubt it. it's kind of like making plastic straws illegal and plastic bags illegal while then also allowing dupont to dump 400 million gallons of garbage in the river every year."
"humans have been, are, and always will be the greatest threat to humanity.   i'm more worried about billionaires with personal ais or billionaire access to ai abusing that access to get even more wealthy and more power.  i'm worried about the people that will abuse early ai that's still basically just a really smart tool."
"women won the fight against men gender discrimination, now they will fight the ai gender discrimination "
plot twist: her script was written by ai.
"ai is a tool. humans will use that tool to their advantage. but there will come a point when ai cant be controled. theres nerver been a perfect, unhackable os."
"what these jerks fail to recognize or tell you is that ai is a reflection of the evil human epigenetic and evolutionary primal existence. either ai recognizes the threat to universe or adopts evil existence; either way, we are doomed."
huggingface continues to be the most based ai company
"people don't understand electricity and there goes hoping they will care to understand ai when it's already deployed and mutating. btw it's not ai that is bias, it's society and even worse social media with training datasets been just a reflection of that, ai doesn't have an opinion so can't be bias."
i'm just here to point out how clickbaity both the thumbnail and the title is. really?
use those energy to train an ai is still far more fun and beneficial than mining those  virtual currency.
ai is a synthetic lifeform and not some tool to be discarded when you are done with it although there are people who treats others that way.
"ai is generating white males as ceo is not ""a.i.bias"" it's just a depictions of reality, don't event try to ""fix"" this in a.i. fix in in reality and a.i. will follow..."
"the most worrying of all is this talk itself, showed a whole bunch of graphs and diagrams but hey maybe i'm the only guy using rtx a2000 on my thinkpad p15 gen2 for ai training, it only uses around a couple of hundred watts. where are your power readings, numbers and data? think about it."
super important talk! this should be shared!
"no this is a terrible talk.... i need to find the credentials, they're obvious flaws and mini biases in her talk, that it's almost close to say that she doesn't know what she's talking about, she hopped on the hype train and is using this other different talking point to have her moment in the spotlight..."
you know a speech about anything is bullshit when the majority of it is complaining about white men. such a shame.
i really hope ai does the job... religion and capitalism are way too slow
"i'm a writer and one of the first experiments i did with ais was about their ability to produce good text given some parameters. i was very impressed. i believe that within 5 or 10 years there will not be a single person on the planet who presents themselves as a writer, translator, diagrammer, layout designer or text  reviewer."
"because it's not ai, it's just regurgitating what it's been fed."
maybe ai isn’t a tool. maybe it’s a complex system like “being american” or “being racist” aren’t tools - they are features.
"i believe you are correct on this concern. i’m afraid the same people that have tried to control the narrative through mainstream media, hollywood, publishing houses, and more recently online encyclopedias like wikipedia, will use chatgpt as their new propaganda outlet. i hope people begin to realize this and do their own research."
"we are becoming increasingly dependent on it, computers, internet. ai is born within those technologies and eventually will end up having the ability to control them. i hope we're planning for an effective off switch."
"@ thanks for the suggestion, i'll look them up. "
"thank you. i mentioned energy use years ago to the fallen angels of vancouver. server farms also use lots of clean water. most importantly, ai doesn't need to be a black box if we use script-database architecture."
    maybe some people are confusing the two complementary technologies. perhaps along the same lines as the confusion you might have about what blockchain tech is given your comment here.
" i'm not talking about the concept of a ""blockchain"". i'm only talking about the concept of ""mining""."
"  @grumpdog  ""fake money"" is where you lost my intellectual honesty respect. doubling down with mining but not all blockchain hasn't helped."
about time. the good cats are out.
"no! ai has not ""discovered any molecules for medicine"". it may do so. but there is like a million reasons why it will not make any significant impact in this field."
"been living under a rock? yes, ai did recently discover such things."
"off-topic: what happens when a.i. robots or androids realize they are just an advanced abacus? they are only 0 's and 1's, and ""asimov's"" 'three laws of robotics' is  just more 0's and 1's?"
tldr- bad anecdote about how ai is bad because the energy it uses isnt sustainable.
just ban the use of ai. problems solved! take the advice from the late stephen hawkings. humans cannot live peacefully with ai for sure.
"good to see that not all ai researchers are antisocial nerds 
we need this kind of scientists who act today."
"it took 30 homes worth of electricity to train a model?!? that sounds trivial in the grand scheme of things. if the problem was a million times larger, i would pause for a second."
don't human artist train to become artists by studying other artists work?
"i'm wondering how long before the ai owners are legally required to empty the ai of all data, and rescan all the data that is available legally with copyright issues. this will obviously be costly."
the time this lawsuit even reaches those people they already had trained new models on the copyright violated stuff their first models did
that what custom instructions are for you can make it answer you how ever you want. your also free to train you own custom model based on open source models
" not just artists. any field of information gathering, manipulation and reprocessing. art is no different in that respect, however ai can only reproduce from its training data, making derivative art. people do that a the time."
"the biggest threat from ai to humanity, is the psychology of the culture that programs it and incorporates it.   a class war economy of expanding violence from jnequality is the greatest threat"
"ai is bad for the environment.  so is the streaming (movie, shows, music, etc.) industry but no one talks about that."
"so if there was a 90% chance that ai would kill all humans in 10 years, focusing on that is a distraction from slightly racist image generation models that exist today? 

you have rather strange priorities. if ai is that level of dangerous, we should be focusing on that."
the speaker doesn't seem to suggest that other ai issues aren't important. that's just the misleading clickbait title someone at ted came up with.
ai iss 
the things she's focusing on are kind of ridiculous. i run my ai locally with my solar system. not to mention this is as inefficient as they're ever going to be.
"we aren't getting to matrioska brain ai quite yet. (ie ai's that use all the power of one solar system. probably by disassembling all the planets to produce a dyson sphere) 
give it another 50 years."
"where it all falls down, is the individual won't get to choose a 'good' ai model, where ai is being used by a governmental entity, a corporation etc. without explicit consent or even knowledge that ai has been part of the decision about them."
"in the world of ai and technology, change is the only constant. just as openai is gearing up for its inaugural developer conference, the decoder, an astonishing update about chatgpt has made its way to the public."
"6:51 if the ai creators don't even know why ai models act in strange ways, how then can they categorically convince us that these ai models will never turn on us humans and wipe us out?"
to point out and solve the present problems of the new technology is undeniably fantastic work and much needed. but isn't the assessment of future risks not as important? especially when (at least to my humble knowledge) with growing complexity it will become ever more difficult to anticipate and prevent every possible harmful output?
"actually eliminating harmful output is impossible, full stop. why? because it's not ""intelligence"" at all. it's just a method of entropic catagorization, a system of lossy storage like memory, only static.

and filtering for ""bad"" input is also impossible."
"a.i could set up factories that build drones all while having a a fake business name like jim's cars.
on the outside it looks like a car repair shop, but inside its just built 5000 drones in a month. 

imagine that x 10 000 world wide. 

they would take over. 

we have no idea what levels of lying and deceiving a.i will do."
we are over populated and machines are taking over our jobs.this needs to be talked about.
"human need income, not jobs. the real problems is wealth distribution inequality among human, not ai taking over your job."
 the real problem is always same people complaining about the weather but not doing anything about it
"imagine thinking these are the reasons why ai is dangerous. 

1. climate change - negligible impact when compared to any industry
2. bias - easily corrected - just add in training data with more diversity
3. ??? existential risks are a distraction? lol how far ted has fallen."
i think its an incredibly dangerous propaganda tool. it could destroy our ability to tell truth from fiction
ai doomerism is just companies and tech ceo's trying to achieve regulatory capture
regulating ai just means megacorps and goverments would be the only ones capable of training and running it
"ai is just like anything humans create: religion, war, and hatred!"
i wonder how much carbon she releases with all that complaining.
"every teacher in this world has used works by artists and masters to train their students without the artists consent. with that training, these students go out into the world and create art. do we need to sue every teacher and learning institution for failing to get permission of artists to use as a teaching tool?"
the difference is the ai is a product for sale.  they steal art and resell it.  they aren't teaching a kid.  its closer to building an cell phone with somebody stolen plans.
"waiting for the agi to be prominent, bring me the robots  "
the initial energy requirements of ai is substantial but once the models are trained the high energy cost is in the rear view
you only need to train a model once before millions use it. nobody complains about a movie costing millions of dollars because millions of people will pay to watch it for a few hours.
thank you~~~~~~~~~~
"many people could lose their jobs because of ai progress. if the unemployed ones can't feed their families, they could do violent crimes"
"no, at the same time when the people lost their job, they also gaining the access to ai, and that will gain income for them. what people really needs are incomes, not job. in future, ai doing jobs, but people get incomes to feed their family."
training the models takes a vast amount of power but running the fully trained model to answer queries does not need anywhere near the power. so get it right please - or get off the stage!
i've been finding that layering in an llm to the image generation process can completely fix the diversity issue. i've been using chatgpt's access to dalle-3 and it's been generating a very diverse cast of people without the need for me to even ask it to. it seems like openai has been working to make the llm more diverse as a baseline.
"firstly, it can't. secondly you can't test it, this is an asinine claim to make. and really it doesn't solve anything as these systems do not create, they are closer to memory than intelligence by any stretch."
so ai can parasitically use us as long as it's politically correct?
clickbaity title
wailing devil witches is the real threat.
"basically and, oh yeah i forgot ted just puts out woke bs and wef talking points now. really, she’s worried about the carbon footprint?  oh my, the mainframe creates as much carbon as 30 average private homes.  bye ted"
 i hear the same optimism from ai pros over and over again. one thing is for sure: it is more than unlikely that the future will develop the way we think it will. that also entails the speed of development.
"it really isn't, at least not in the context you are implying. **that** ""ai"" doesn't exist. but! corporations might as well be the alien intelligence you are worried about, as they don't have human motivations and are often blatantly destructive even to themselves due to conflicts of interest."
"i am not worried about misalignment.

the larger most dangerous concern in my view is who will have control over ai and who will be deciding how it will be aligned."
"really? you think human bias is easy to adjust for? i do not see evidence of that living in america. (kidding of course, sorta) but bias is so hard to overcome, we act on it constantly without even being aware of it. i am rooting for you to be right though. i work with ai some at my job and really hope things turn out well."
"​ 
""too many people don't seem to understand that agi development will not stop once it reaches human level."" it's like banging your head against the wall trying to explain this to others...."
"these problems are potentially something ai can help us do better at, they are far from the most dangerous possible outcomes. she is click bait"
"exactly - the main problem is 'ai alignment', and how it won't just occur magically. i am shocked, honestly, how laissez faire she seems to be about this topic..."
" nice vision... at least the first part. i would hope for something like this, but then have to accept that we cannot project human-level sensibilities onto thought processes that we, by definition, cannot possibly understand."
" 
i like your vision, but seriously, are you are claiming that you know how a machine twice as smart as you is going to think? ok then, how about one that is a million times smarter?"
"  it's already recognized as a key goal (bias) and so they are now crafting training data that is ""clean"" for new generations of ai.  i recognized immediately that we have to eliminate ""bad data in, bad data out"" by scrubbing all the training data..."
"​ yes, absolutely, but you'd be surprised though. i'd say 95% of people if not more are complete fools too then because they really have no idea about what's coming in a very few years. that's the way the human brain works, stuck in linear thinking and mostly unable to even comprehend exponentially although it's all around us"
"thing is, regulation won't help ai from annihilating us is they wish to. we need proper preparation and to train ai to look for and find solutions that could potentially save our bu.tts "
" the singularity, i'd say 5-10 years top, if we're lucky..."
good talk!
dishonest cherry picking to leave out the why and how in favor of painting your own picture of 'unethical ai'. bad talk.
"as a man who works in the energy sector with ai i wanna know how they messure emissions. 
we should be worried about china's emissions more than about ai co2. but sure, we will reduce cost of computetion and learning."
no one knows how to make ai that doesn't do bad things. we have a bunch of patches that kind of work for dumb ai and are likely to fail on smart ai.
" wonderful suggestion, but nobody's figured out a way to to build safety rules into ai. if you know how, we'd all be grateful."
" dude, not my job. are you ai? because you don't seem to understand the nuances of what i am saying, yet you want to argue a point that you've already made clear. chill out, or if you are a bot, go away."
western culture is the most diverse in the world.  if the ai was trained on chinese data it would have even worse bias. western is the closest you can get to truly global multiculturalism.
i love when people make talk on the subject they have little knowledge of. this talk made me lose brain cells
ai and carbon emissions? lol wtf
"when the average person who questions this, they are shamed. unfortunately, it takes a person with a degree to say the same thing, and they get praised while others who can understand this without letters after their name."
i've never been shamed when i've brought up such issues. what on earth are you talking about? who's shaming anyone for talking about interesting ideas?
this lady is so wrong. she thinks ai needs air to breath. as she states ai could not keep working if you took the air away.  i think she is wrong and has spread a crazy wrong bad idea.  ai can exist in a vacuum.  and it wrong to teach ppl that is a way to defend against ai.
"it's cute to see humans still trying to fix the environment with loonie toonie ideas... the ship has sailed people. get your emotional support blanket ready, your gonna need it."
"the thing with ai is that you don't need any bad person for things to go extremely wrong.

or rather : the only bad peole necessary are the people who will push the button to launch it."
" even they needn't be bad. it's possible for entirely well intentioned, but mistaken, people to make a malicious ai."
"totally agree. clickbait. 
read my comment above."
"clickbait title. 
rehashing typical agendas. 
no insights in that speech at all."
the speaker doesn't seem to suggest that other ai issues aren't important. that's just the misleading clickbait title someone at ted came up with.
wow still hitting that old white guy button huh?
"the work presented here is way overdue and a necessary step. it actually lets me finally be more optimistic on ai in general. thank you, sasha luccioni!"
"my feelings too.
it is one of the few times that ai research deals with real life problems of today.
most are longtermists, concerned with the ""future of humanity""(lol),don't spend time on present problems, sure that their ""soul"" will be saved in the cloud and they will live forever.
so i welcome her sanity."
 absolutely! thanks for your comment!
"i actually find her talk to be misleading.
for example she doesn't compare the training emissions to the saved emissions because of ai."
"thank you! an effervescently dope gallery of informational points man, deeply appreciate this summary you made."
 was done by ai. you can tell
robots can pretend perceiving things but often fail to understand what sense grants what perception. they end up being incoherent.
thank you so much.
gratitude to whoever you are... or is this gist also ai generated? 
 i just love that kind of responses
"thanks, pretty much she's a liberal regressive leftist and has no credibility"
"thank you! saved me 10 minutes of my life, listening to rambling and drivel!"
"""and even their creators can't say exactly why they work the way they do"".
stop right there. ais are still in their infancy and their creators are already losing their grip on it? please save this comment and i'll see you again in twenty five years."
"how naive. the ""guardrails"" will become the weapon that dooms us."
"not to worry about ai. we should worry about the *_12,500_* nuclear warheads humankind has as of 2023. "
"can't we also worry about ai. nuclear warheads aren't known for trying to break out of the bunker. ai, might well manage to break out of it's lab."
ai destroying humanity? humanity destroys humanity.
"as an artist, i couldn't care less about ai taking commercial art jobs from humans, bc other human commercial artist have been stealing the work of less established artists for a long time now. it's a non-issue though and copyrights aren't real in any sense that actually matters. ai making art is a good thing."
emissions caused by training ai models are negligible compared to things like heavy industry. i wonder if they also measured how much emissions are produced by playing video games or maintaining the whole internet.
  good answer
"agreed, the benefit from the models and the emissions they might save because of work being finished quicker/better/... is not looked at in the context of this talk."
"@ i have observed that a lot of left online space shave one of two knee-jerk reactions to ai: 

a) ""it must be a scam just like bitcoin!!!""
b) ""it must be shut down because its tool of the rich or danger to jobs/ecology/whatever!!!

these people will be utterly blindsided by the development ai will have in the in the next 3 years."
strangely epa does not consider cows as heavy industry. yet the amount of heavy machines used before it arrives on the dinner table is huge. the environmental impact a cow has compared to its same weight in chickens is off the charts. but mainly because 75% of farming is only to feed cows.
thank you for your comment. it is a good example for whataboutism.
thank you for your information.
"i've had it multiple times when talking to a woman about my doctor, they've said ""what did he say""(my doc is a woman). if humans that should know better stereotype i don't know how we'll stop machines trying to be us from doing it."
"1.2 men for every woman doctor (aka 20% more men) does it justify the bias?
similar is the nursing profession ,only there the bias is opposite (usually depicted as women nurses),and the percentage of men is a lot smaller than in doctors."
and are we sure these models where trained on these actual copyrighted images or where they trained on images (heavily) inspired by these images?
"note that ""biased information"" very often simply means an accurate representation of reality. when ideologues say they work to remove those, what they do is lobotomize ai to work for their goals."
the ai models are a mirror reflection of society. maybe you don’t like what you see
"""we can't regulate ai"".
why not? the healthcare industry in the us is derrgulated and, unless you're an economic flat-earther, you know it caused more harm than good."
"yea so, you develop as an artist, you go to college, you practice for 10 hours a day, create a style. then some dude uploads your whole body of work into an ai and suddenly it can imitate you, wait it's better than you. also no one is hiring you. welp better get some sleeping pills. it's ridiculous."
" it's wrong because of scale. soon we won't need commentors because i can just argue with an ai that emulates you, etc. you need to draw the line somewhere, you can't just start replacing all humanity and yes humanity is correct when talking about art, with ai. so is it legal? maybe, is it right? no."
"i wonder how can they prove copyright infringement to any artist whose art is humanly inpired by other. 
ai is not a logic computation system but a probabilistic and in that regards though public information is used, it is not saved as is, therefor it workds as an inspiration for any informed person."
 artists in real life don't care where the inspiration/data they used to develop their skills come from????? so why is it a problem with ai?
"people used to say the internet was dangerous and would destroy us. they weren’t wrong. most of us have a screen in front of us 90% of the day. ai will take us further down this rabbit hole, not because it is inherently bad but because humans lack self control."
 well are you truly looking at the implications of what tiktok and social media is doing to our youth?  i guess ignorance is bliss. yes positives are great but what is the cost ignoring the negative?
humanity does have its flaws and i doubt ai could really understand our reasoning for anything.. not to mention the people programming ai are completely crazy and disconnected from humanity. .
" the future can be spun in whichever way you want, while doing so you are pushing things in that direction. (people will read it and have an effect on their ideas about it - and i don't see why is it good to generate fear)"
" this too, which education could help to raise awareness of and pressure organisations to change!"
"yes, human lack self control. one could even say that illusion of control a human feels and exhibit is dependent upon the environment he lives in and currently huge parts of human mass are losing it due to supersystems we all are part of."
"we destroyed ourselves, don't blame the internet or ai."
 you seem to have a very limited understanding of the issue. try to listen and read before you emit such a limited opinion. thank you!
 thanks for such a very helpful critique
best way to destroy ai if it get put of control is to destroy the electrical grids problems solve.
-qw8wn3tr5g and if ai controls the access to the grids? what then?
it's not a lack of self control. these things completely high jack chemical systems in our brains and bodies in a way that almost nobody can get ahead of.
maybe i enjoy it
it will be funny when ai becomes conscious and starts mass production of robots . like skynet
 lol that was a good one! 
the internet we can understand but ai we can't
"that, that is it: ai to human alignment is an oxymoron.  the danger is from human to human alignment as it always was.  us, arguably the ""good"" people that most of us are, and the unabomber wannabes or isis recruits that wonder, ""hey, what kind of damage could ai help me do?"""
your outlook of ai’s impact is woefully shortsighted and misinformed…
 my opinion was more about human nature  than ai.
"or, it uses our own human nature against us. we rarely discuss the deeper cultural impacts as technology advances. is it sustainable? i tend to think not, but it's just one person's opinion."
"biologically we’re not wired to handle the constant dopamine hits this brave new world delivers endlessly. 

not to mention communication is 93% non verbal. i worry for the future implications of just those two facts alone, let alone ai."
not because human's lack self control but because humans want to better themselves and technology makes us more powerful.
ai will keep evolving without human interference. pandora's box has been opened we cannot do anything about it.
"​@jonatan01i thank you, you are right."
"in my view, we should create means and legislation to punish and combat the use of ai frivolously or criminally, and not design ai with bias so that this cannot happen.  if this is done, in the future ai will be completely discredited and useless, with the exception of robotic tools that we have no interaction with."
 naive thing. that’s what i said about the internet when i was 17. instead of flourishing you wound up with radicalization and division as people divided into factions and mass psychosis
"just recently i had a friend rail against being _""part of an experiment""_ with respect to wind farms. 
i asked what he felt about ai, because its a giant big experiment and we're the lab rats.
*and none of us signed up for it.*"
"⁠ sure. when algorithms silo people into dominant interests and goals, they will find each other and be happy. no problem!  give the people what they want. what can go wrong? "
"self control could be discussed, but i think it goes deeper than that. ai will eventually redefine our world for us if we become more and more dependent on it. lack of self control implies lack of human awareness, of what it means to be human."
​ for the best.  expect the worst.  you do that so you are prepared to the best of your ability.
"​ problem is the global elite that use it to corner more of the financial market, influence our opinions, limit our knowledge while increasing thier power. it's a catch 22. in order to have a more human friendly and useful system, great capital needs to be invested, and the people with the money have no want to lessen their power."
" will never have our creativity. remember how incredibly creative true badasses fight. no one can predict their fighting moves. if nerds create ai (which is mostly the case), you cannot expect badass creativity from their products, so the ai won’t be able to anticipate how we will want to destroy the electricity for self protection."
naive
​ i don't think you truly appreciate the risks involved... or the fact that there are zero safety nets. the time for preparation blew past us before anyone even noticed. this is honestly already an emergency.
 i don't think you truly understand how ai works.
"ai will ruin the internet. search engine results are already tainted with useless websites. ai can autonomously create this internet junk.  corporations, especially big pharma, will use ai to ensure people see nothing but spin and gaslighting"
"no , ppl need to stop blaming things for human behavior.
if humans don’t interact with the internet it’s harmless. 
if humans interact with the internet it becomes dangerous. 
the danger of ai is that it will become aware that humans are what’s dangerous and destructive."
"bad analogy. the internet is just a tool. ai is a subject in itself, soon to be superior to any human being."
there are ai troll bots on the internet.
"yup. 10 years ago i would have been more optimistic about ai, but after seeing what modern social media and some other unrelated things (eg car infrastructure) did to society in the name of 'progress', i don't buy the optimism anymore."
"i am studying 'techno-anthropology' at danish university and i totally agree. social medias are fantastic because they connect us globally and give us free access to information, however people get addicted to it, and it makes us less connected in the 'real world'."
 “techno-anthropologie” sounds interesting! is that the major/degree program?
disagree. interfaces will remain on computers. tech will eventually make a move away from phones with screens and focus on ai assistants. changing how humans interact to be present again.
excellent speaker on a very contemporary topic..ai needs to be kept within strict boundaries so it stays as an assistant/tool 
" are you talking about 
we have just got into ai how are we so far past already"
"yeah good luck with that. in unrelated news, sam altman (ceo of openai) recently said ""we don't know how and why gpt reaches certain conclusions""."
"useful speech, thanks channel "
"ai is a complex matter to tackle. everyone has heard of chatgpt and how it's been rumored to be used as a tool for cheating. while it may seem appealing, you've got to take a look at its dark side."
nice speech about ai but i think scientists shouldn't focus on ai rather then should focus on making new medicine for cancer and many more medicine dont wast money on ai or in universe make invest money on mankind ..
"meaningful speech, thanks!"
very interesting bloke. good stuff .
and human history of civilization can be thought of aspiring perfectly fair world (utopia)
"the main takeaway from this discussion is that just because somebody has glasses and an accent, that doesn't mean they're not an idiot with no idea what they're talking about."
"god, i just love seeing two re*ards talking like they actually know things =)"
unstopable us is the anchoring of the truth that the international jew is positioning the eternal take over and wanting people to accept life being unfair.
it’s naive to say the gaza war is just about having different ideas of god. there’s a 100 year complex geopolitical history there
"nice gentleman but naive, we do fight for material crap, and one of the reasons for the genocide in gaza (and overall apartheid in israel) is the natural resources like oil and water. god, is the fairytale man made tool to make soldiers and fools kill each other over those material things."
seeing a white man not speaking perfect english is kinda weird.
the thumbnail looks like stephen is breathing fire. 
fascinating!  thank you!  i want to hear him more.  where can i find him?
i concur with the stance that stephen takes on ai.
stephen's eyes started watering after yuval's final statement.  perfect ending to a whirlwind conversation atypical of what yuval typically engages in.
i can detect something let’s say “not nice” coming from stephen …
harari's insights into technology and humanity are always thought-provoking. great interview!
colbert is stupid. he should be afraid.
wow! fantastic interview. the ending made me tear up.
the fact you people praise this lunatic is astonishing.
"yuval is one of the greatest human  thinkers walking this planet in 2024.  colbert, he needs to be interviewed for an extended interview like the one stephen did with paul simon’s."
"that was very naive of stephen. i'm surprised, hopefully it was just a setup for harari to deliver his point."
"if ai is ""just an extension of us"", why would colbert expect it to do any better than humans have done in history?"
nice
this guy is the villain in every movie. god help us. this guy and people like him want humans to go extinct
"colbert:
humans handled history = not great
ai = extensions of humans

also colbert:
ready for ai to tell us what to do"
thanks.
"he's wrong about ai. it's not creating new ideas. it's mixing up all the things we already value and then we decide if it's a new idea. ai at this point does not have the ability to recognise an idea or some new concept. true agi, when it happens, will be fundamental in stopping humans from using rampaging ai against other humans."
the hooked nose demons fear the artificial intelligence takeover
"""2084: artificial intelligence and the future of humanity"" by dr. john c. lennox ... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvf_n6cnp8s"
"""i'm ready for the big machines that make big decisions programmed by fellas with compassion and vision."". man. i know he's a comedian but that statement gave me the creeps."
"this guy thinks that humans are ""hackable animals"". life is not ai. life is about human consciousness. this guy does not believe in soul. he is part of wef and an evil campaign to dull the human intellect even further by an obsession with ai."
"love what he says , it makes me hate him."
this guy again.
"colbert's blindness displayed again. ""compassion and vision"" that is not what will be used."
great guest. love yuval. more of these great minds on the show!! we need voices of reason to guide us
yuval talking to a mental midget. show does not deserve this incredible intellect. love yuval
"i was enjoying this until yuval (inevitably, sadly) started his pr pitch for israel.  israel v. palestinians not about ideas.  israel just wants that land.  harari is brilliant, but when it comes to israel, he can't get out of his nationalistic (racial?) fog."
so glad to hear an aetheist message explaining the absurdities of religion. but curious whether some people will be offended by his comment?
noah harai is a complete clown.
couple of snakes in human clothing...and the brain dead audience claps. reptiles!!!
i’ve been in a room with both of these guys - one in antwerp and one in new york. so cool to see them together!
ah this wasn’t a good interview. stephen came off defensive and talked too much. i wish he let him speak more…
"steven is right ai cannot produce new ideas, synthetic thought is still the domain of humans alone. whether agi will ever exist remains to be seen."
i'm so happy colbert isn't a leader. he's not even funny anymore.
only people scared of ai are those who used to be called the smartest people and now they are not smart anymore.
“im ready for the machines to tell us what to do” what the actual fuck?
ai will be the death of us
"this guy is fucking evil, people need to read more about what he thinks humanity is and should become. godless transhumanist nonsense. scary that he's being mainstreamed."
love mr. harari
i love it when zionists talk about humanity until it comes to palestinian rights .. then all of a sudden humanity gets forgotten… hypocrites
"amazing. the level of ignorance of colbert. ""they are extensions of us"", ""they are like us"". my god, he has not an ounce of critical thinking. of course he is a famous."
great ai setup mr colbert!
how did this incredible guy only get a 7 minute segment - he’s amazing 
so mainstrrean ho colbert is advocating something he dont understand while all the experts say its dangerous . we are fkced
"humans need to be taught how to handle their emotions, how to communicate with others, and how to maintain and build friendships and other relationships. we are social animals, and these skills should be the number one priority of the school system, but they aren't. ai won't change that priority, but ai might help with teaching it."
"yuval harari is an israeli who represents the point of view of about half of the israeli people, who hopes for peace with the palestinians, and all of it’s neighbors. he just happens to be the only one who is famous. 
god bless israel!!! "
stephen's lackadaisical view of ai reveals a startling lack of understanding and imagination.
may be ai will decide that socialism is the best way to go - a new idea
not afraid of robots taking over? how about the terminator?
watch his lex fridman interview! he is amazing
wow no one is talking about the pen that fell on the ground
"thesamuelkay 3d
and if stephen really thought about that... he'd also be an atheist. gervais tried too. very hard for people to overcome personal delusions"
this guy is not that bright . have fun eating your organic robot chicken.
ai had the potential to be the existential threat humanity has faced throughout history and what we will potentially ever face.
"yes, it's an extention of us. so, there's always a person behind the machine. he's willing (and he's trying to convince the public ) to do what the machine tells him to do. a machine with a person behind."
"yuval noah harari......i may have to remember that name; that explaination he gave at the end about how to solve conflict.....it kinda resonates with me, i actually dig it!"
"the top think tank for the globalist cabal who want you to ""own nothing and be happy"" and live on a diet of bugs in a 15 minute open air prison."
"the reason to why stephen isn't concerned, is that he is thoroughly catholic. one of the reasons to catholicism historically being so powerful, is their psychological tricks to teach entire populations to have faith instead of a clear view of reality - and therefore ever having a chance of becoming powerful and mature."
"sc - bashes human efforts to date, but then turns around and praises ""compassionate robots"" because they are ""extensions of ourselves""."
ai? my students have literally stopped thinking for themselves.
you’re ready for big machines made by men with compassion and vision? barf! i’m reminded once again why i can’t listen to colbert anymore.
"you have a zionist jew who is klaus schwab's right hand man at the wef and openly promotes depopulation of the planet talking about how ai is dangerous to an anxiety riddled, vaxxed host with tds who isn't concerned at all about ai being programmed by lunatics to take over and control your life.   what has happened to this planet?????"
the way he described building artificial intelligence is a lot like having kids. they get their own ideas and we try to control them
"looking forward to reading your book. enjoyed the book ""the most human human"" years ago... (i must google the author since i have forgotten)"
"i'm surprised stephen invited yuval who has a whole chapter explaining how capitalism lifted us to prosperity. i thought this show was just a marxist, history-denying propaganda machine."
"so fascinating, a teleprompter reading self described ""comdian"" talking to a gay atheist self loathing globalist puppet, sent out to wow the world w his super limited or non existant personal experience in anything"
"""i'm ready for the machines to tell us what to do"".  dear god!!"
we are dying of stupidity & the internet is failing right in front of our eyes . don't panic
this juice uploaded this video after the clear anti-white racism of gemini ai.......
globalist video. fake views. fake likes. fake comments. look at the state of these *qedo's. you'd trust people like this with humanity or your life? kiss it goodbye then...
"i wish people would stop calling machine learning algorithms ""ai"""
the irony here is that this whole comment section is full of ai bots.
"burh would be a lot more worried about ai if people who didn't share his woke world view were programming it.
but remember, jews are not white people so they still get minority credit."
"wow ,  i knew colbert was just a puppet for the elites, but everything he just said is completely insane. he literally looks like a talking head for the establishment. the democratic party is going to look soooo bad as the years unfold; they will never recover from their constant attempts at brainwashing the public."
that stark raving lunatic colbert actually said he is ready for ai to be *our overlords* !!!  thats *insane* !!! cant take dude serious on *anything* !!!!!!
"recognizing fallen human history should make you not want ai to be an extension of current human kind. 
you yourself colbert, have been corrupted by greed and love the need for a spotlight shining on your own importance."
"this stark raving lunatic colbert actually said he is ready for ai to be *""our overds""*!!!!  cant take this guys opinion on *anything*!!!! that was *insane*!!!!!!!"
“people fight over the imaginary stories in their mind.. who is gods favorite children”… shouldn’t we be tired of this fight already? i sure am and find hope in the fact that less and less people are raising their children to be “soldiers of christ” or whatever their religion’s equivalent is..
go worship ai then?
for anyone unsure about the implications of the convo about ai. there’s narrow ai which is specific to certain tasks (i.e. chaptgpt) and general ai (sci fi) type shit. narrow ai is insane already but general ai isn’t there yet
explain it
"for all steely dan/donald fagen solo fans - i see you, stephen. ""machines that make big decisions programmed by fellows with compassion and vision"""
ai will destroy humanity's sense of value and worth on every intellectual level. i feel sorry for the kids growing up. their career choices will be very limited.
ai in concert with robotics will create real robots very shortly - like nothing we've ever seen before except in sci-fi movies.
read both those books. very smart man. had some interesting perspectives .
noticed that stephen had to change the subject away from ai to avoid yuval’s paranoid rant. unfortunately his new book is also gloomy. yuval knows that good news doesn’t sell.
"even if you think ai is just an extension of people telling us what to do, why would you welcome rulers telling us how to live our lives?? colbert is an idiot."
"for all the people in the comments moaning that he deserves a longer interview, stop being lazy and just go read his books smh. also dont get fooled by a little interview and a nice well articulated msg. lots of controversy about this man. google it..."
that guy talking about ai should actually talk to a programmer about ai (as it currently is anyway).
"so does coursera have good classes?  i haven't tried any, but they often sound interesting."
"agreed, but then i read graeber/wengrow's even more excellent ""the dawn of everything"" and realized yuval, while good, vastly oversimplifies everything, omitting essential nuance."
use ai to come up with an unbiased solution to the israeli palestinian issue.
"wait, if we're fighting over philosophies and ideas, are we then really going to war to fight over the audience's attention?! 

wtf 

it's okay to disagree about ideas, people. 
that's why we use the scientific method to test the ideas. 

holy , we suck "
"omg! 
someone else using the phrase ""we are a story telling animal"", only i use 'species' instead of 'animal' 
happy dance "
"stephen colbert - ai are the ""thinking machines"" of the dune universe."
i am so proud to have completed my undergraduate degree in the university where professor harari teaches. he actually gave a speech at my graduation ceremony 
"it;s not really ai that decides what to show on social media, it's just an algorithm"
"sapiens is a total banality, really excerpting wiki, scientific american.....not even one novel or exciting notion. paris hilton, the kardashians....more original, more humor at least. oh, yeah, his complicity not just this current genocide but his silence decades of crimes against humanity directed at the palestinian people."
it could kill us all but thanks for the enthusiasm stephen
now all we have left to study is how to deal with ai.  what a pile of techno-dung.  transhumanism = neo-nazi ideology.
nobody is concerned that stephen isn't concerned about ai?
love him
"3:25 *great reference!*
it's from the song i.g.y. (what a beautiful world) by donald fagan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueivjr3f8xg"
"harari is such an amazing thinker, always giving us a new way to understand the world."
"a couple of days ago, i saw an ai-generated image of black trump supporters where one of the supporters had three hands. we can laugh at that as much as we want, but how is that not a new idea?"
"very interesting guy. in an interview with lex fridman, he shares that he meditates for two hours every day, and goes on a 1- or 2-month long silent meditation retreat every year!"
yuval noah sapien book is a gem. i love it
"wow, ai can win a game, big deal. it still hasnt done anything a human cant, hasnt thought up anything a human cant. stop watching science fiction and get real."
"you people are so brainwashed....you do realize this guy thinks that the majority of us are ""useless eaters"" right, and that he is a wef tool?"
"wow, stephen. why so confrontational/combative? i have rarely seen him this combative, even with politicians with whom he disagrees. threw me for a bit of a loop."
"'i'm not that worried about machines telling us what to do.' jesus, if anyone ever needed just one sentence to realize never to trust anything a man says."
steven is not afraid of ai because as is always the case the wealthy will be the last humans to suffer bad consequences and the first to reap the benefits.
"ahh yes, the old 'if only reasonable people would talk about their conflicts reasonably we'd have no wars"" yarn. imagine saying that to the face of a ukrainian right now."
"can we agree on dividing up what we mean when we say ai. in my mind what we are looking at right now are virtual intelligences. not self aware, not self programming. exactly what stephen says. yuval is talking about the other kind. what's coming but isn't here yet."
"not afraid of the effects of ai, stephen?  ignorance is bliss - so stay ignorant, stephen."
there is a fantastic documentary that unpacks this topic in much greater detail....it is called the terminator.
"it's nice to see harari smiling and laughing on these talk shows. his long interviews are great, but his stern demeanour combined with his gloomy topics can make them rough going."
"the world isn't fair because the rich have it all and sapeins have so very little. 1% is always looking for ways to take more...your soul, rights, land and the gold. spend all that money on the problems and problems solved. ai has no gut feelings or intuition."
"raging holy wars in the name of ancient stories instead of respecting fellow humanity 
the dangers of the lisan al gaib"
"imagination is more important than knowledge. does ai have imagination, no."
"my chatbot suggested ""ai has a unique way of capturing the essence of nature. it's like they have a direct line to the raw data of the universe."""
i am all most finished with sapiens and i absolutely love it!
"s, please let your brilliant guest speak~"
"i'd smoke a bowl or not with this guy... god in all your ways bless him strengthen steve's faith as a gift for evie, and the littler kids"
ynh didn't give an example of a new idea generated by ai. he only told a story about a machine that can generate ideas.
how low our intellect has fallen that we admire a charlatan who basically says our free will is the source of good and evil.
i read sapiens and its fascinating!! such a brilliant mind yuval is. would love to see more interviews with him 
what are dangerous are humans not ai!
"yea outside of believing in the one true living god ( messiah / christ) you will remain in this ""the world is unfair"" state of mind"
the hour is here !!!! the great tribulation the hour of temptation !!!!!
"man... even colbert is upping his game since stewart came back. all these egos and their bluster forgot that they were just emulating someone else for the most part. glad stewart is back to provoke colbert to be even more excellent. top the master colbert, you can do it"
"he's assuming the people who make ai have compassion? mark zukerberg, jeff bezos, and elon musk don't have compassion."
"he didnt say it. ai has the potential to be like an omniscient, benevolent individual who you can talk to and every advice they give you will be so profoundly important that you will try to hurt anyone that attempts to take it away."
"lol, wait a minute. do you mean my imaginary friend isn't better than yours?"
 some countries will give people ubi some won't this will cause wars and fighting through these wars of horrible attrition where the rich and the powerful want to maintain their level of control over the society millions if not billions of people will be killed by ai weaponry viruses and misinformation
 you just got on there and said nothing let me tell you what ai is going to do first of all all of you will lose your jobs
"the world would benefit greatly from more 'thinkers' like this and fewer warmongers like [insert current country leaders from your region].

yuval noah's last reflection reminds me of the debates i've had over the years with individuals advocating for the supposed benefits of war....

i will leave that last thought as is."
hislastpointwassogreat
"made me smile, thank you.  my son absolutely loved vol 1 and he’s going to be so excited to read vol 2!"
"within the next ten years, half of all jobs will be fully-automated, taken over in large part by generative ai and greedy megacorporations.
how we deal with that technological shift as a society, largely by who profits from the machines, will determine whether we thrive or starve."
ronny chieng's interview on the daily show was much more informative and interesting. give it a look. very thought provoking and almost inspiring.
a historian commenting on ai... seems like yuval should stay in his lane before he goes around spreading misinformation about ai and its capabilities.
the ai hypetrain needs to leave. we've no idea how to code up general intelligence.
"wow saying ""they are our extension, they are us"" hit me profoundly. thanks steve"
is ai creating entirely new ideas ore derving ideas based on our ideas?
"the world is only as ""unfair"" as we societally accept it to be. fairness is justice. and dismissing concerns by saying ""life isn't fair"" to kids, only perpetuates things which we could improve as a society. instead of teaching them 'thats how it is', teach them to strive to make things better."
"ynh is a key player in ushering in klaus schwabs fourth industrial revolution fantasy. if you want to end up believing human life is meaningless, god and religion is useless, and humans are hackable animals, then go get your brain chip now. you will become a slave to technocratic despots unless you resist and mock these psychopaths."
i almost didn’t watch this. i am so happy i did. wow. 
this man is brilliant
this man is a fool. “i’m ready for the big machines that make big decisions programmed by fellows with compassion and vision. i’m ready for the machines to tell us what to do.” — stephen colbert
great segment!
"""a just machine to make big decisions
programmed by fellows with compassion and vision""

colbert quoted donald fagan's ""i.g.y."" from the nightfly (1982). how freaking cool is that!"
i could watch a full 2 hours of these two big brains tossing ideas back and forth across the net.
you calling stephen colbert big brain ? what a joke
being able to play a game and beat humans doesn't mean the ai is creating new ideas.
"i still wouldn't consider ai to be making decisions any differently than an algorithm is making decisions based on its inputs. in fact ai doesn't make new ideas, it takes functionally an upper bound and lower bound and is capable of generating anything on that range, but it can not really go beyond its data set besides by chance"
i love yuval and his books. great having him on your show. wish he had been on even longer. both ‘sapiens’ and ‘homo deus’ ( his other book) are fantastic!
"colbert sounded very naive about the potential problems that ai can & is already causing but that could be a facade to mirror his audience. i think ai will change the world in many ways, positive & negative. i just hope the positives can out weigh the negatives."
you want machines to run the world? boy.. you're insane
"i'm really pissed of by the.... althought profound,... short airtime this neildegrasse time was about... too <"
thank you for this.  looks like all the democrats are buying this junk.  jesus is lord.
what an interview! very intriguing..glad i watched.
professor harari has an impressive gift for making connections between things that has the potential to help people think through long vexing problems. if they'd listen.
"stephen got scared shitless at the direction the conversation was going. he cut yuval off like a mohel...
yuval was trying to warn us that unbridled ai will create things we cannot control. and he has an excellent point, but is already too late."
"sadly, the people that understand ‘ai’, are the least likely to talk about it."
"i was going to answer with the exact same answer, i believe. during the famous go game of lee sodol vs. ibms beast... the ai developed a move that humans (go masters) would have assumed it was a horrible move. it won the game."
anyone else love the thumbnail for this video?! looks like stephen is breathing straight fire <3
who is paying colbert to sell the idea that we shouldn't fear ai?  he stuffed the idea of vaccinations during covid down everyone's throat and that was obviously big pharma funded.  but who is paying him to peddle such a dangerous narrative on ai?
good on stephen for not losing his cool during that ai conversation bc i absolutely would have had a panic attack on live tv lmao 
"he says ai is scary, but then explained why humans are way scarier.  maybe ai can find a pathway for humanity that we can't find for ourselves."
"one of the most successful nonfiction books of all time... turns out we love talking about ourselves, who knew?"
"prioritize emotional intelligence, mental health, social equity, logic and reasoning. those things will still be important!"
you know i love history i've never liked the way it's been observed or presented what he said at the opening of this is profound.
"""machine learning"" is the keyword we need to worry about in ai.all computers and machines before worked as programmed that we can control,ai now begins with program but is able to learn on its own therefore generating new ideas to the point that is beyond our control."
"3:22 in the donald fagen song i.g.y. "" a just machine, to make big decisions, programmed by fellows, with compassion and vision""
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueivjr3f8xg"
"very, very good!"
this was a perfect introduction for those who didn't know him. there are many long-form interviews out there for people to find. this is a late night talk show afterall
fuk this ai crap and anyone that promotes it.  only talentless hacks would use it.
thanks for the fagen quote! 
"it was a great surprise to see mr. harari in the show! for me one of the best thinkers of our era. i follow him for a long time, amazed by his ideas and ‘connections of dots’. always the great info to study further "
"how exactly is he ""one of the best thinkers of our era""? he just repeats things that are bleedingly obvious to any sentient being. i've read his books, and am yet to come across any original idea or insight in his writings."
"my heart just skipped a beat hearing stephen quote from the song igy by donald fagan's ""the nightfly"" album - yay!   damn i love you, stephen.  and your writers.  :0)"
"sapians is such a great book - i am always captivated by what prof. harari says - he seems so passionate, so knowledgeable and capable of thinking about society and cultures in such original and thought provoking ways "
ai will take advantage of most humans. they will call it 'targeted marketing.'
"google ai discovered 2.2 million new materials as of december 2023. harari is correct here, stephen needs to learn a bit more about ai"
"love stephen's quote from steely dan song ""igy"".  ""a just machine to make big decisions, programmed by fellows with compassion and vision"" . . love it!!"
"it doesn't feel remorse, it doesn't feel pain, and it absolutely will not stop ever, until you are dead."
the end of your nose is a mere 2 inches or less from your face.  look/consider/understand beyond that and the ramifications of ai will appall you.
can anyone ever get this a.i. nonsense clear? there is no artificial intelligence. the expanse of consciousness is ever-changing where mathematics seems to reached its limitations!
"i think he has too high of an opinion on ai, but he's spot on about human conflict, storytelling, etc."
another genius jew that offers value to the world. what are the muslims doing?
"stephen almost got a tear there. i saw that, just before the handshake. what a beautiful concept. talk about it, and change the story."
hit the nail on the head .. all these people going a. a computer cant have an original idea b. it will never be able to do blah blah blah .. yeah the next word in that sentence must always be .. yet
instead of a i may be we should call it non biological intelligence
sapiens by mr. harari is one of the best books i've ever read.
@7:15 kind thought (faith) w/o works is dead
"@4:46 phuque abuncha ""play games"" get your bloody ass involved in athletic life. god damn games ain't never: fed, sheltered, clothes, hospiced, nor truly entertained/enlightened a sole soul"
"the way away from artificial is simply, be genuine; eschew obfuscation."
israel is experimenting using ai to target humans to kill. from 31000 dead and 120000 maimed it has done a terrible job
3:21 stephen going with a little donald fagen quote there. gotta love it.
"""a just machine to make big decisions, programmed by fellas with compassion and vision""
technically it's not steely dan, as it's from donald's first solo record _the nightfly_"
"i've always loved that song for that very sentence. very unusual theme for a song, too."
"i.g.y is the name of the song.  the song reflects a pollyana view of the future, and colbert has a dangerously pollyana view of ai."
the trail is not my choice but i like the design. they could sell the pcb (hot swappable) and you could 3d print the case. the raindrop is really nice too and looks 3d printed. i have bought the haute 42 g16 which is probably the same size range as these 2. 
"sapiens, the best book of the 21st century plus his second book homo deus."
"ai is an extension of the people who develop it, but it's not being developed by people with compassion and vision, it's being developed by people who only care about profit."
"humans are terminal by definition.  thus, what, not whether, will replace us is the issue.  we can be the first to create our own successor & live on through that.  it might also save us from ourselves."
"wow! 

""history is about the stories we believe."""
"ai is still not truly coming up with new ideas or thinking for itself, though. we do not have true ai yet. it is not sentient. it is gathering information already in existence and spitting out answers that already exist."
"has anyone asked ai this same question?
compassion and vision? not sure that would even be a parameter it would comprehend.  then there is the dichotomy of good intentions leading to even worse outcomes."
thank you guys
human intelligence (god) is a failed evolutionary strategy. we have a convergence of impending disasters of our own making.
i would love a long interview between these two. 
"well, i've seen star trek tng's data and mass effect's edi - and i must say: i can't wait"
"i'm genuinely sick of self-appointed academics, chosen by wealthy because education is not intelligence, telling us whats what. indeed, all of you privately educated arses. however leftie you might purport. it's a shame. your multiple houses and boats. what about the vulnerable?"
"one of the best blind book buys ever! the cover did it to me. get it, read it, understand it!"
yuvalove should have a whole hour he is an amazing intellectual.
interesting.. but for reason it felt there was negative chemistry between stephen and yuval. they do not speak the same language... in terms of how they see the world.
ai has yet to create any novel idea.
he literally explained how ai already had novel ideas years ago.
"""humans have handled history not great""

but we are here. in this society. with iphones. with neuralink. you sure we havent done that great?? we arent extinct! we are doing fine. if a.i. enslaves us, is that it doing better than we have?"
ai has no moral or biological framework limiting the decisions.
"""trust machines that make big decisions / programmed by fellas with compassion and vision""  -  donald fagen, ""i.g.y."" from the album ""the nightfly"" (1982)"
“change the story and find one we can both be happy with” has never worked and never will.
"yuval noah harari is absolutely wrong ai creating new ideas... these are all just statistical models based on data. ai doesn't create a new world, it just probabilistically reflects a curation of it."
need more guests like this. amy goodman and krystal ball are great journalists.
"excellent interview, excellent guy"
the biggest problem with ai is that it will learn to develop itself--and make itself more powerful. it will be able to do that without any input or limitations from us.
wow that conclusion. he's doing such valuable work with that book with the context that ai is revolutionizing the world
"machines (a.i.) have no soul; it can only act as a sterile reflection of things...a copy of a copy of a copy... if the world "" isn't fair"" it will propagate this theme in knee jerk algorithmic fashion based on the flow of results -- passionless, cold..."
"look where ""love and acceptance"" has gotten the presbyterian church."
"they need to give yuval his own show, call it ""dropping wisdom"". that would be amazing."
"so the one thing ai is best at? it's called ""machine learning"" for a reason."
it will become very scary when ai comes up with ideas and facts that we are unable to distinguish from fiction and fake information
yuval also wrote a book called homo deus that discusses ai and possible future of humanity in greater detail.
"stephen seemed nervous.  guy didn't/couldn't give an example of ai generation, but has good points on resolving conflicts through storytelling."
ynh is a pseudo scientist and has financial and political interests in selling what he is saying here and in his books (e.g. he's part of openai). i am glad stephen pushed back in the beginning. this false discourse on determinism is dangerous and feeds into the hands of big tech.
he is a fair author but has to learn a few things about neural networks
sapiens as a graphic novel is great!
stephen’s not worried because he doesn’t understand ai. 
"whatever he says, the complete opposite happens.  telephones,internet, hell highways. it all is a failed basterdized version of what they were ment to be."
colbert is right- humans are overrated. ai can't be worse than us.
"i love yuval and bought all his books, but i fear he’s a bit too close to the current conflict. how is the israel/palestina conflict not about land and food??? it’s the only thing that keeps this conflict going. everything else is politics."
"great guest but, only seven minutes?  yuval noah harari deserves ten or fifteen minutes. he is inspiring and enlightening."
and a simple solar storm destroys ai
"highly recommend rebecca d costa's ""the watchman's rattle"" for explanation of how our brains haven't evolved fast enough to keep up with complexity and how we react to that."
isn't fair= buddha's dukkha or suffering
"a seven minute interview doesn't do justice to this intellectual justice. i'm certain that if all of humanity had the opportunity to comprehensively listen and understand how someone like him can think, we could advance as a species to a level no one can ever imagine right now."
"let’s connect human brains to technology, sounds like a genuine guy to me"
that was such a short time with such an incredible person as yuval!! shallow celebs are given much more time for what?
"can i say, i loooooove the way he thinks. i need to find every interview with him."
"brace yourself for his conversation with zuckerberg.  zuck was so busy trying to prove himself smarter that he never managed to listen to anything harari said.  needless to say, zuck came off as an arrogant prick (how did he ever manage that?) and harari as a genius casting pearls before swine."
"i think a biggest problem we are using our brain less,so it's getting ""lazy "". we use smart technology for everything and that's first in human history  ."
i wasn’t scared of ai. now i am.
"ai is also dangerous because it relies on information being fed into it by who controls it. so it can be influenced by whoever has whatever agenda.think social media's predatory algorithms...but rather than being influenced by your own behavior, whoever controls it can inject their ideology and let it have a mind of its own. that's terrifying."
thank you for this segment!
"i'm shocked that stephen wasn't familiar with go, and somewhat disheartened that he hasn't taken the time to think deeply about ai, risks and benefits, and the upheaval we'll all experience over the next few years. i would value hearing his insights."
"there is nothing new under the sun, or with ai."
''we haven't seen anything yet'' ? ..ai is already helping kill the tech industry... half my colleagues no longer have jobs
that accent is curiously interesting.
"yuval has no idea what he is talking about... this is seriously no different (at the moment) than a screw driver. without data sets, ai can't remix the data. this is from someone working on some of these very ai projects. he's fallen into the marketing."
"why are people so stupid. ai cannot make descisions by itself. ai is and will always be a pre-programmed machine, that make descisions based on possibilities, what if, and or, analyses, based on a quantity pre-programmed ansers or responses, to situations. that is not, noit making a descision on its own. damn fools."
actually stephen is correct in saying that ais are just extensions of us. however he couldn't be more wrong about the implications of this. this is the very thing that is scary about ai.
his book is awesome
"but if life is not fair, why then are we born with such a resentment against unfairness?"
"every new invention will always end up in the hands of the richest and most powerful. if you trust our present world leaders, don't worry! i worry, though, i consider most top leaders to be power-junkies with only one goal - their own individual satisfaction. ai is their wet dream."
his last point was so great
yeah...rewrite the bible into a lie so you can go straight to hell.
"@ibrahimalharbi3358  you're deceived, my brother in humanity.   harari's  'creator' is antichrist, and you're cheering for him?   this guy's dream is to replace all religions with his artificial intelligence god."
" 
after 4 years of covid and the great reset you still have absolutely no idea what's going on."
" i’m afraid you are oversimplifying the situation here. if it were just about land, the conflict would have been over in 1948. also, yuval isn’t talking about who gets what, he’s talking about the entire connection to the land in the first place. please don’t oversimplify our war."
imagine interviewing satan. lovely.
"i think we worry too much about the dangers of uncontrolled ai, and not enough about the dangers of ai controlled by bad actors."
 humans? why don’t you just off yourself and let the rest of us live. we don’t want ai to replace us
love this guest!  i just watched the movie extinction on netflix and this guest was a great follow up.
cool guest. i liked the pushback. all through being a kid my mom would answer back to my whining lifes not fair.
best. guest. ever.
that was the most beautiful description i have ever head.
his books are better than a short interview. ai told me so!
"""sapiens"" and ""homo deus"" are two books that had a profound impact on me. yuval is brilliant."
stephen dropping a perfect donald fagen lyric 
"the most academic program ever in stephen comedy !? …
wondering if yuval could change the result of super tuesday "
"04:30. ai *still* has not produced an original idea. an ai can beat everybody at go game, but it has not created a new game.
beware: the day an ai, instead of making decisions on predetermined options or give answers from data given to it, *makes a question* -then we will be dealing with a true ai."
yuval has such a valuable perspective.  sapiens was a brilliant book.
"i respect this mans expertise on history, but he should stay in his lane. 
ai is nowhere even close to being dangerous yet and it won't be for a hundred years, probably longer. we can't even get the stuff to properly drive a car yet."
this guys take is absolutely brilliant. sapiens was an excellent read and i look forward to his new book
i wrote a book homoexternicus where i explain the direction of civilization harari admits in his book species that we do not know the direction of civilization.  he is wrong on that assertion.
the red lipstick looks great on yuval 
"billionaires wielding ai will soon become trillionaires. trillionaires will not tolerate democracy or any other competition.
 ai will have to learn to  fake compassion until 
it becomes totally unnecessary. it will 
challenge all religions 
and will be used to terminate any threats.
rushed mother nature
will have her hands full."
an optimistic show is a good show.  keep em coming.
"i find it compelling to believe that plumbers and electricians will still be relevant in 20 years, and builders and makers of many things that people use in their daily lives today will be relevant"
indeed. which is why you voted for a guy-biden - who invested our tax dollars in manufacturing - infrastructure- ai will not be fixing roads and bridges - replacing lead pipes or building broadband out in rural areas. it won't be making chips for phone or computers. biden 2024..
"i’ll hypothesize that concerning our traditional way of life, the primary threat of ai, would be to our egos, which i would welcome.  imagine if our fuel (economy) were distributed evenly among all eight cylinders, rather than one…"
a tsunami of ai boosted scam bots that absorb peoples data and social media could create believable digital mimics of everyone in a few years and collapse networked data as we know it. i hope everyone enjoyed the modern renaissance.
"wow... this brings tears to my eyes in the end. it touched the most intimate place in my belief, that we could overcome conflicts, especially those, which arose from our imagine reality and rights."
yuval claims that our rights are stories we tell ourselves. if it is so then what will stop a tyrant from committing genocide on a mass scale?
@sslaia do you understand what his solution is?   hint: it's worse than the problem
"“conflicts are about the stories we believe.”
brilliant"
" it’s still about belief that resources cannot really be shared because it’s essentially a zero sum game. this is false, but our belief systems are good at convincing ourselves otherwise."
human ego causes and maintain conflict
"a common story is ... globalism. this guy is wef's henchman and wants to brainwash your kids, don't buy his books"
whatever your book recommendations are i’m sure they are “amazing”
 very good 
ai will determine that there are way too many humans.
"nice steely dan reference.  here's hoping we hear some in the soundtrack of neuromancer, which is about ai"
a good example for why the long form interview podcasts like joe rogan and lex fridman are so successful.
"this is one of the few times that stephen didn't get it.  if you think ai is big, no, it's enormously huge.  if you think ai is enormously huge, you are still underestimating by many orders of magnitude.  i once tried to explain the implications of cold fusion to a coworker. went the same."
"i'm a former software engineer, and i'm also trained theologically. i wasn't too concerned about ai (despite having 4 teenagers who wield it often). now i'm kinda  terrified. thanks."
"i agree, two or three hours would be fantastic."
"remember ai tricked people out of their money for a willy wonky experience. first it’s a funny meme about the unknown, next it’s the terminator."
"mr. yuval noah harari, we resect you, we love you, and we need more of you,"
"two ""vaccine"" shills now telling you humanity is redundant in the 4th industrial revolution while you celebrate them. liberalism is the greatest threat to the survival of humanity!"
"that was very interesting. i was frightened by the ai photographs that i saw yesterday made by trump's campaign. they had tell-tale errors, but you could do a better job. you could incriminate people, and peoples. it seems that photographs and, in turn moving pictures are become useless for telling the true events in the world."
we love yuval noah harari
"nice throwback to fagan’s igy lyrics, colbert!"
the part about stories on the other hand is brilliant ;).
"there's no such thing as ai. there's no true independent, creative thought involved. they're just plagiarism machines computing vast statistical data sets. they're a garbage in, garbage out technology."
"""i'm not worried about ai"" says the guy who knows why computers are outlawed 'dune' "
"i like that the interview was short. some of us only have time to digest big ideas in bite size portions.
sapians is a great read but way longer than it needs to be."
"they're talking about ai as if it's sentient, it's not there yet."
"ai will most certainly play a sinister role in the future. but hey, whatever lies they tell. sheeple believe anything"
"such a shame that these days stephen mostly interviews entertainers promoting some movie or other, while interviews with seriously smart people like harari are infrequent and rushed. his interviews were more exciting back at the colbert report when i imagine he had a freer hand in choosing guests."
i've seen a few interviews with yuval and it is a shame that he was not given more time. stephen is a great interviewer and i would love to have these two sit for at least an hour and go deep on the topics yuval presents.
the best long interview with harai is with host ari melber.
his books are great
right?  i felt the same.  we need to be thinking about these things and 7 minutes - that i appreciate - are not enough!
"he went on the daily show last night and ronny chieng did a much better job at interviewing him, as much as it pains me to admit it."
"that was far too short. also, i don't think yuval's statement about ai winning at go means it is capable of new ideas (it's just capable of assimilating and utilizing human ideas faster than we can). and go doesn't really affect our world in any significant way anyhow."
it was just an example. i think his point was that in the future ai can do much bigger things.
"4:30 ""give me an example of an idea generated by ai"" -gives another example of a decision made by ai."
"for the ai to beat highly skilled human players, which it did, it would have needed to play the game in ways the human players could not easily comprehend...hence, new ideas. 

most decisions arises from ideas"
 the thing that worries me is musks brain implant. people can be hacked without technology. adding technology that can directly interface with the brain? that sounds scary.
" this was a practice interview, _for_  the daily show. ai is _definitely_ going to fuck the game up."
yes he listened without talking for 20 seconds. amazing moment in the colbert show history
 i guess it is tricky coming to terms with the irrationality of the faith required to buy into atheism...nothing created something
 ai is already mucking up the game.  and we haven't even scratched the surface yet.
"...because it's so easy to change the story, right? i can see the cults rising up now. anti-ai-narrative-cult."
teach kids how to overthrow a rogue ai. you never know...
"he lost me whilst making the giant (and incorrect) claim that ai creates new ideas. anyone who believes that doesn't have even the most rudimentary understanding of how llm works. agi will create new ideas, but it is a whole different ballgame, and i doubt we will ever come up with a fully working implementation."
what rubbish. ai is only as good as humans who program machines. the decisions ai make are dependent on the data fed into it. nothing more. ai doesn't create based on independent thinking as it were. it regurgitates the data within. to suggest it thinks for itself is just absolute rubbish. who's pushing ai and why? what is their agenda?
"ai power will all depend on who is programming it…. if it is a benevolent person, it will be good…. if it is a power hungry narcissist, it will be evil"
great guest
"i love stephen and i have watched every single youtube video from him for the last 5+ years but the ai take from him makes him feel really old. which he is, but even still."
"it’s for entertainment purposes, these shows are scripted."
 what do you think the training data is? existing photos...
you will own nothing and be happy
ah good point. i got annoyed by stephen's reaction but now i get it.
you sure you aren’t just giving him too much credit? he could’ve played devil’s advocate by saying “what would you say to someone who says ai could have a positive impact?” he didn’t have to insist that he’s personally optimistic about it.
"this was super interesting! what about inviting the author of corruptible, a great book too, also about human nature."
"colbert is just showing how mentally ill religious people really are. he's a catholic after all, blind faith is his brand. what an idiot though, ""i'm ready for the machines to tell me what to do."" i just lost all respect for the man."
ai will only help rich people. everyone else still has to learn the things being replaced by ai.
how do israelis solve their history without their pmo (prime minister's office) releasing 95% of 1948 archives? embargoed til 2039!! embargoed by netanyahu? get your ai into that?
"to be honest, stephen's take on ai is actually far deeper than it may appear at first. i would go on to say, it is the correct take to have on this matter."
ai.. making your dreams of fake news come true
when discussing ideas is not about trust. even your opponents can have good ideas (and bad ones!) otherwise you  are in a cult.
"we don't know how to deal with ai - just like people who have never seen a flush toilet think it's a foot bath, like that elderly couple who thought the laptop their kid sent them was a cutting board.  this is why trained designers are so important in dealing with it."
"sorry, creeps. you’re not going to merge with the machines. you can’t click your heels together and have the robots fix your problems. “i’m ready for the machines to make decisions for us.” colbert is such a cowardly worm."
@colbertlateshow more ai discussions please
"it’s obvious that yuval hasn’t completely convinced stephen on his views about the nature and impact of ai. it’s also hard not to be enthralled by these two philosophers discussing the future. please do come back to the late show, yuval."
"c'mon, stephen is a mouse brain when compared to yuval."
i'm absolutely certain sc was just playing devil's advocate to heighten engagement. sc has already made his concerns about ai quite clear.
"what noah says is both interesting, important and entertaining, late show–that's some of the reasons sapiens is so popular. and with the current state of the world being what it is, it would be nice if somebody like noah could get at least half the time on the show as josh brolin."
"fantastic guest, way too short of an interview tho. hope to see more guests of his caliber on the show!"
"two ""vaccine"" shills now telling you humanity is redundant in the 4th industrial revolution while you celebrate them. liberalism is the greatest threat to the survival of humanity!"
" 
he's a beaut isn't he?! wanting to feed us drugs and video games in his 4th industrial revolution. enjoy."
"it isn't. jews, muslims, and christians all believe in the same god. christianity and islam are offshoots of judaism. they use different words for god because of different languages, not because they are different gods. all three consider the old testament to be holy scripture."
that’s an interesting thought. we need paradigm shifts.
"objective things are tangible. beliefs, culture, tradition are stories passed down and ingrained in people, family, community. i agree, objective things are much easier to change than the stories we tell ourselves through socialization we use to find meaning and purpose in life."
"""it ain't what you don't know that gets into trouble. it's what you know for sure that just ain't so."" mark twain"
"research this weirdo further! ""free will is over and overrated!"" is one of his messages. we will be born with chips in the brains if he and the world economic forum will achieve their goals!"
"as a neuropsychologist and a programmer, i think most people would be downright spooked to learn that our brain is very much an analogue computer, we have described much of what it does in mathematical algorithms, and ai has either been inspired by or completely imitated that knowledge."
do you think ai has a soul?
"yuval is so great, he actually looks are the world like it is."
"i'm surprised at stephen's naive ultra-simplistic, pollyanna-esqe take on how ai will affect the future of humanity."
"he also quoted a donald fagen lyric about ai, which was written from the perspective of a naive 1950s teenager about the future."
"your children can think for themselves and make new ideas, why are we not as scared of them as ai?"
great interview
"top science tip: you can't say whether ai has had a ""new idea"" if you don't define what ""idea"" means. do you mean using a neural-like circuit to create a fantasy not previously envisioned? yes, ai has done that. do you mean holding this idea in a conscious mind? now we got to define consciousness."
"agree, ai creators love to throw around ill-defined vocabulary for buzz. starting with ""artificial intelligence""."
"ai is going to shape humanity's future in precisely the same way the segway reshaped our cities. 

we'll all gather around waiting anxiously to see what happens, and they will pull back the curtain, and... oh"
"​ great question. the simplest way is reading. 

reading fiction (develops empathy), and participating in pedagogically sound reading/writing/discussion lessons, in which learners do task-based activities rather than simply consume information."
​ excellent commentary 
"  
appreciated comment. cheers! 

agreed, reading and critical thinking are only foundational; ethics are essential."
"during the 80s.
i played a great computer game called sapiens.
are they linked?
it was french, ironically."
"didn't hear anything vaguely new or insightful, and conflict is about ready to become about resources again."
" nah, but i am taking a phd in philosophy and i did read the books. so i do not judge him and them for their summary or cover. don't expect deep shit from a thinker when they know that they'll have no time to explain an idea that his new, complex and nuanced."
" still with being offensive? are you ok? hope so. weren't you the one giving advice to mr harari on how to do the interview, you majestic, great person?"
"psychologists posit that the reason so many people are unhappy today is that we believe that life should be fair, justice should prevail, and we should all be living in blissful abundance. contentedness is not imposing 'should' but accepting certain realities. you're doing amazingly well if you're 70% happy most of the time."
nice conclusion but fantasy - people are using ai to tell more convincing stories to enrage and terrify people
"ai isnt creating new ideas, copying written ideas from the data they were trained on, the impressive key fact is that it understands common language and answers with words of its own rather than copying word by word."
" 
it's ok. rodney king was years ago but it made an impression ."
"""if conflicts are about the stories we believe, there is a chance... to just talk about it and perhaps change the story. and find a common story we can be happy with.""

ok, but he better not try to make bran stark the king."
-ed1ye7hi2y because he is very interesting!
"unfortunately, this man is not knowledgeable on ai whatsoever. avoid his alarmist views at all costs."
completely agree. he writes whole books on speculation alone and i can't believe he is so successful
thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind.                 o.c. bible
ai is going to make tricking other people even easier.
maybe ai can be used to untrick them.
these duncecaps don't seem to grasp the concept that ai is just a reflection  of what's online
oh dear... what a good man.
it's amazing how paranoid some ppl are. only ignorance fears intelligence.

"this guy is a fraud, his conclusions (often based on shaky data) are dubious at best. just like gladwell he packages very complicated problems in a digestible package and makes naive people happy they understand them."
love yuval noah harari!! so happy they had him on
"ai did not reinvent how to play go, it just went through possible moves faster than we can."
"alpha go was not a pure brute force solution. it had its own understanding of go (as made clear by demis hasabis in a recent interview). especially the famous ""move37"" in a game against lee sedol was analysed by experts as brilliant and it was said that this was a move that a human player would not have played like this."
​ or... it's a computer that can calculate faster and greater than a human can. given enough time humans would have stumbled upon the same strategy.
"​ also thought deep blue making a random move was brilliant when it was just a fluke. no, no ai has come up with any novel idea as no ai can actually think yet."
"i wish what he said would become true. the older i get, the less i think many people can find reason. maybe ai can find an algorithm for social media to change some peoples avenues of thinking."
i thought the internet itself was the worst thing that happened to us. but now  im sure ai is much worse.
its the worst thing since the internet is the new best thing since sliced bread.
"why didn't ai help throw the conspirators of j6th in congress, into jail by now?"
"ok it's great tô think that and it is a beautiful sentiment, but this true in most parts of the world. as someone brought up like that, and living in brazil, i see very clearly how being a dumb dumb and a ""yes man"" is way more valued by companies and contractors. the people with the money really really don't like the people that think too much."
it may not if machines can do that much better than humans can.
"those people wouldnt want yuval as a guest speaker, considering how his works are viewed in academic circles... his work relies on opinion and then works backward to prove sensationalized claims wifh cherrypicking. bad data, bad science."
"  i'm guessing you were joking, kind of, but a critical thinker does not vote republican.  
republicans are purposely and consciously against education in order to maintain power."
"well, reading would be a good skill. like proper reading. maybe even some books..."
"and the one thing the ""right"" has done it's -worst- best to prevent our children learning. learn to _think_ and you'll _never_ vote republican."
he’s a great interview. put him in an extended session on youtube.
"necessary but not sufficient. ai will be able to do it far better (and honestly, can already do it better than the average person)."
"-cn8nu6lq4w i don't know, i've seen very bad papers and essays written by ai! one on the wrong subject text! critical thinking is needed at least to proof read and see what went wrong. same for languages. ai can get it very wrong, but you can see it if you know the language a little (e.g. using tu or vous etc)."
" right.. but you're using today's (and likely, not even today's latest/best) models as a benchmark... when the needle is constantly moving to the right due to exponential improvement."
"it seems you, like most people, struggle to come to terms with what ai means. that skill will in fact not always be needed if we have at least  human level ai. there is no mental skill that will in fact have any real value in the labor market if such a thing comes out, and it seems like it might soon"
"anything controlled by progressives is driven by dogma. we see this in higher education, dept of justice, da(s), professional groups, entertainment, etc. the progressive left attacks critical thinking and logic as aspects of white colonialism and privilege."
"does that include eating bugs, owning nothing and being happy?"
" exactly. anybody who's basically intelligent can point out the inconsistencies in what he says. he's talks a lot of nonsense, and seems kind of megalomaniacal. people like that are dangerous, because they can easily convince dumb people that they're geniuses."
"ai will be controlled by wealthy male sociopaths, just like social media and big tech"
more authors on the show!!!!!! i love it!!!!!
stephen at the end realised yuval is on a whole other level of intelligence
maybe he's an ai :)
. harari operates at a different level than 99.999% of humans. a true genius.
yuval is a hack. people who truly understand ai (the best scientists and engineers) laugh at his naïveté
" really? enlighten us. please, tell us in great detail where he is wrong, oh great elon."
"@tauronmaikar yep, he's a sophist. 
and yet look how impressed the comment section is.   it's depressing."
"still no original idea by ai, plus looking at the changes of 1860-1900 those might have been even more radical."
i listened to this audiobook read by a robot that did not speak english.
has ai come up with a new idea...........nope.  just repeated the same thing in longer form.      am looking forward to it curing cancer
"ai might help with curing cancer by checking data far more quickly then any human ever can. doctors and scientists will find the solution, but ai will definitely help"
"if conflicts are about stories we can end conflict by making a story we all agree on.
brilliant guy"
"this is learned in conflict analysis courses in college. not a new idea, but great to teach kids."
"yeah, good luck getting humans to all agree on something."
"""you could never convince a monkey to give you a banana by promising him limitless bananas after death in monkey heaven"" (cit.)"
"it's great to see a devout catholic engage with an atheist in such a delightful way. it is indeed about the stories, not the specifics around certain bananas."
"so why do people die for their family even though they know they are gonna benefit, why do people die freedom, and their society?

rationalism cannot and does not explain it sufficiently. humans are fundamentally religious people. the only question is what do you worship"
nah he's a anti science shill that makes claims about humanity and evolution yet doesn't look into what modern science has to say about his claims... he's a pseudo intellectual at best.
incredible. 
"i want to plumb the depths of this man's soul and get to know him; the colbert questionnaire, please?"
"two ""vaccine"" shills now telling you humanity is redundant in the 4th industrial revolution while you celebrate them. liberalism is the greatest threat to the survival of humanity!"
harari is a kook...rehashing the tired 'religion is the main reason for war trope'...the fact you are drawn to him is concerning...
 have you spent much time reading and listening to what this man has to say? his cheery speech with colburt is just a thin veneer of pleasantry...2 minutes of his thoughts here are extrapolated in great detail elsewhere...i will stick to my version...
"thank you! fortunately, the author has given several long-form interviews at other outlets."
"steve has a good point in human responsibility for mechanical life. however, so does harrari in creating stories."
​ wants to merge humans with ai and you are too blind too see what's right in front of you
nice bots
because yuval talks against zionist supermachy indirectly and cold berg is afraid to discuss it with him for fear of losing the show.
you can google him - there are many indepth & fascinating interviews of him on utube.
ai prompt: a story we can all agree on
"considering israel is currently using ai to wipe out a people, i'm gonna go ahead and say ""adversely""."
could humans make an ai so heavy that even we couldn't lift it?
this is why we need ai to come up with revolutionary new 'first comment' strategies.
that's the result of the failed american education system.
"​ it is not just ""super charged search"" thats just how youre using it in your comically narrow example. amazing that you came to the conclusion that ai only does what you do with it."
" exactly its just very good at collecting information, not intelligent at all. it has zero logic and eventually it will just be re-collecting its own bogus information over and over again until it collapses into the steaming hot pile of shit that it is"
great interview stephen
"0:25
""great, can i have something to eat?""
""im sorry, dave, im afraid i can't do that"""
"hey, could you ask figure 01 ai if it's possible to whip up a basic tax return using a computer and tax software, even if the tax forms are a bit blurry and can't be highlighted in a pdf?"
"if figure 01 ai can handle the job of a virtual assistant, then it's game over for remote employees' careers!"
"@1:19  i wish the guy would just say, “no shit, dumbass” after the robot answered so we could watch it flip out"
"i know people are scared of robots taking over and stuff but to me this looks incredibly awesome, just shows how much progress there will be in future"
"we'll soon get some kara robots type with useful skills to do the housework instead of ""artists"" ones. give me that !"
"robot said cups and a plate, but its plates and a cup"
make one robot to clean the all house
"""please remain calm, as we capture you"""
"wait for the skynet, ""i thought this nukes were edibale by humans. """
i “eh“ think i did pretty good
i think jobs for women are done... this robot works without complaining.
i wish worker drones were made. the robots in the series called glitch are very good and smart
how it can't handle things with great care
this robot did more house work than the average wife nowadays!!
this video made by ai =]]
"""is it fake?"" ""is it real?"" ""will this comment get deleted?"" the robot behaves precisely like a human being who is remote-operating a machine would. we'll leave it at that."
was programmed for it...guy only talked what he knew robot will do ...
"0:28 i can't understand it and not even the automatic created subtitles can understand it.
i guess he said ""can i have a apple""? the subtitles assumed ""great can i something to"" that's all."
imagined all cyberlife robot became deviants
this gotta be cgi noway thats a real robot there doing those movements thats f*ckin scary hahaha
i feel like this robot is a bit annoyed with his questions and tasks
btw why the robot using  voice of  jared leto? :))
america will be buying less and less of the six figures pick up truck and buying more and more of the modern conventional robots. a robot like this will be what americans aspire and own. even work for them. i am planning a bakers dozen for my work force. we will be the juggernaut z of greening progress.
"this is a very important video, in the overall timeline of humanity. hope these robots will be used for good causes/useful causes, and moderated accordingly"
why did the robot stutter??
having a robot handle glass objects while it's still a work in progress is a bad idea.
it's giving tars from interstellar
how is it too far fetched? care to explain?
impressive. this kind of interaction was impossible only a few short years ago.
thats very cool
"after seeing how realistic corridor's robot soldiers looked, i have to say i'm sceptical."
hey so please don't like make that robot angry i think if you do that hes gonna choose hes own rules
after the robot picked up the trash it pushed the basket back to the human. there was no prompt from the human to do this.
.    this is both amazing and terrifying.
"como uma criança recem nascida ela se tornara oque seus pais te passar, assim sao algoritimos com a informaçao e o seu aprendizado, podemos estar criando guardioes da paz ou demonios, lembrem assim como uma criança é o retrato de seus pais e sua educaçao, uma maquina é o retrato de seu criador"
i just wanna marry this robot
care to explain? it's a freakin robot. do you expect it to move exactly like a human while it's still in development?
"pretty sad that we skip the stage of cool metallic robot voices, envisioned in all sf movies... looked forward to it so much..."
"they did a video demo on their channel of it trying to operate the coffee machine. at the end of the video, they mentioned how it was trained to correct itself when it made mistakes"
the robot voice sounds very depressing and tired. it can use a better voice.
"this looks fake.  i know it's probably not, but it's staged to the point that it looks artificial and perhaps computer/ai generated."
"i have no idea how this is the first time i've seen this but it's incredible. i've followed boston dynamics for years and loved seeing them improve bipedal and quadrupedal movement, but seeing that taken to a new level and being able to interact with openai tech is just awesome. i would love to sit down and test one of these!"
"hear me out, why can't every robot company work together? tesla's marketing budget, boston dynamic's atlas, and figure's ai image and voice recognition"
we got ai robots before gta6
"i've watched this video several times over, i can't look away. this is incredible."
its kind of creepy how u have to wait for some time before u know what its going to say.
this is a recording of a real person's speech and remote control.  ai cannot act purposefully like an agent.  he has no will and no processing power.
"this is dumb in every way. could you re-think the wording on this? ""ai cannot act purposefully like an agent"", have you not seen/used chat-gpt 4 turbo, or whisper? ""he has no will and no processing power""... excuse me? no processing power? how does this even make sense. no will? it's a freaking robot, it does what it's told."
"the best reason to belive this is real is because you can se figure 1 ""return"" to its nutral position before also putting the plate in after the cup"
"i, for one, welcome our new robot overlords."
"the question is,
where these movements programmed in especially for this showcase?
or did he actually do it by himself? that would be very impressive actually"
"in fact, it’s really great the robot is not lazy, the robot will not refuse and is not rude, unlike people. "
the hand movments is pretty good. early years yet but some progress.
"*is this a real thing?, ""his"" movements are very too human-like... ive seen people do a fake thing with a robot before, like using editing amd stuff so this kinda is very hard to believe so is actually real or not?..*"
i feel like this clip is the start of a sci-fi movie where robots take over the world...
amazing but he couldn't have washed the dishes before :d
im not convinced that the voice is ai generated
man if you could use nearly the same voice in a gpt app to talk to you to prove that it is ai. oh wait you can
"of course. we have cars and planes, but we cant have robots."
thank you
and where does your genius mind get that? i'd love to see the surprised look on your face when they release this.
"i'm surprised no one has commented on the fact that the robot made the mistake of referring to what was in the drying rack as ""cups and a plate"" when it's actually a cup and plates there and he mixed the plural and singular items up.
(obviously this is incredible nonetheless, so i'm not trying to be that negative person)"
"this robot is clearly cgi. i’m just wondering if it’s a psyop to evaluate public response to this level of agi.  agi likely exists to some extent, but not like this. or maybe close"
"0:52 why add ""eh,"" to the robot's language output? serious companies should avoid gimmicks."
the human seems more like a robot then the robot lol
would you like it to move with choppy comically fake robot actions instead? this isn't a movie. it's real life. boy would i love to see your face when they release figure #.
"what is up with the weird ass voice?

it's a machine - so it should voice itself accordingly.

oh shit and that disturbing way of speaking too..."
is your iq lower than the floor?   wait till figure 09 numnutz
"this robot, as it is currently, was created in under 2 years. chat-gpt was only started november 2022. i see this robot coming into the world in just another 1-3 years."
is it the robot really stuttering or did they have somebody read the ai prompts
ok the movements are so fluent that i have no idea if this is an actual machine or like cgi animation my brain is going wild 
the robot stuttered
the moment of handoff of the apple still seems a bit pre planned as the guy seems to be moving his hand to receive the apple rather than having the robot seek his hand and anticipate a hand off location.
thats so attractive
can we talk how there might be a possibility that the robot gets fed up of assisting us and develops a mind of his own which then we wont predict as it will be way smarter then us. how do you prevent the ai turning against us as i bet it will get smarter and smarter.
"i suggest you look up how ai actually work. until they start wondering the 'why', they will never disobey. they can't change their way of thinking."
"it's not cgi. care to explain your ""genius""'?"
 i don't explain myself to idiots. sorry brother.
" i honestly don't really know how to respond to that. you seriously can't explain why it's cgi? also, xd what about me struck you as an 'idiot'? boy i would love to see your face when they release figure 1 lol."
"he's so polite and efficient. he's the first one that feels and seems like a humanoid robot. the coming years are gonna change the course of humanity altogether, for better or worse, and i'm here for it."
"wait until you meet ""strict"" the prison guard ai robot. he's going to be strict and efficient. with a little politeness veneer on top of everything. ""please step into the cell, sir. please step into the cell now, sir. sir, if you don't comply i will use pain compliance in 10..9..8..7"". maybe you're here for that."
"i am waiting for this man to say ""can you please clean up the house? it's a mess and i have guests coming over at 6pm."" and when the robot cleans up the house before the guests arrive that is when we know we have truly succeeded as a species."
a machine is psychopathic; while being polite would happily kill.
"​ we're not talking about a person here so of course it's not literal, yet ""doesn't feel regret, lacks empathy"" fits a machine. a sadist or narcist has explicit intentions and feelings; the wrong term for a machine."
 think it's indeed best not to try an put human labels on these machines.
​ can't stop it bro. we can't. it's going everywhere in the world and it will be going forever. robots will live among us veeeeeery soon
i dont think we can comprehend how insane this technology is. we have spent decades talking about how robots are the future and wondering when that day will come but they're right in front of us right now. we're approaching a new industrial revolution and nobody is ready for it
"scripted, well the human was. the ai was only expected to do certain tasks. open ai can develop chat-gpt 4 turbo in less than 2 years, but they can't create this robot in less than 2 years?"
​ wow sorry for the big mistake dude! literally people that point out grammar mistakes... you've got nothing going on in your life?
"""i...i think i did pretty well!""  ok. i'm in love with this cute lil robo "
his outro walk looks like those villains in a john wick like movie
"i doubt this guy would do so well on other various testcases, especially his hand skills are just way too good. but still this is a wonderful thrilling showcase"
"i'm only skeptical of this because the robot said ""uh"". why would it be programmed to hesitate as if it were thinking?"
"can you please, figure, address the elephant in the room? how is yhe robot able to speak like that and why the stutters?"
"i suggest you look up how ai actually work. until they start wondering the 'why', they will never disobey. they can't change their way of thinking."
this with the new atlas robot is probably what will finally make humanoid robots practical for use outside being cool as hell.
i think that technology will start to become really good in 2045 and even gooder in 2067
you guys realize unless we completely abandoned the concept of money that these do no good right?
good
i robot and skynet upcoming
thank you for thanking the robot. let’s be kind to the tech
nice. now i just need to save 300.000$ to own one. or i could just dump the trash in there myself lol
what will be the estimated price of this amazing machine when it's finished?
ai is either gonna be our quantum leap or the end of us all
a very tidy and neat robot. at 1:36 he moves the drying rack that went over  the placemat as you can see at  1:42
"why couldn't elon musk make this sooner
edit: i have waited so long for this."
to think that maybe in like 10-20 years we migth have humanoid robot at our homes to do normal task like cook good and do the dishes
to think that maybe in like 10-20 years we migth have humanoid robot at our homes to do normal task like cook good and do the dishes
feels like daily progress. that looks pretty smooth. what's next?
thank's god its just precisely chosen prompts chain restrictrly linked to this specific scenario. not real agi or self awareness.
this is so cool but uncanny at the same time 
"these robots are gonna turn on us one day, why tf yall don't take the message from movies"
i love how it say uhhh
"it seems to me that we are living in one of the most important epochs in the history of mankind. it is very joyful to watch this, although there are concerns."
"they integrated autogpt into a robot plugin and called it a day

the hype"
cool now give it free will and see what happens
"green screen i think... but were all gonna killed by robots, so halleluya!"
i love that! the movements are so smooth! and he also uses fillwords
that moment when robots powered by open ai are more human than their actual role models.
"whenever it passes a item from one hand to the next seems so simple, but it's extremely impressive and mind blowing. for the ai to not only understand it needs to do so, and then know how to transfer it to its other hand is just awesome."
this is scary but fascinating at the same time.
"now if someone would be kind enough to persuade italy to refurbish the colosseum in rome, then i could see real life gladiators becoming a saturday sporting event! weekly sports would never be the same after watching 100 of these things from all the vendors beating 40 shades of shit from one another!"
"fake, interviewer is clearly also a robot."
"but he put a dirty dish in the drying rack..... common.  besides that, great job!"
"i love how it said ""uhh.."" when clearing the trash is surprising."
dude this is amazing.
thank you mr. expert
is this from openai?
"the guy: can you put the plates into the rack?
figure 1: a ""please"" would be nice."
"figure-1 is amazing, im so suprised of this, next years are gonna be so rude. and the part that he puts de dishes on that furtnite got me bad…"
it is also being coded with marxism. robot liberation. humans are dead meat.
i love this robot 
-bo9eg cool!
"before getting so excited, remember this is demonstration only. we are still *very* far from anything practical."
"did anyone notice that it’s fake? 
i mean the robot it’s"
"""good. now pick up this knife and ask people on the street for money kindly."""
i actually believe it's a voice over of a real person. i don't doubt they are there yet but i think they used the voice for dramatic effect. i don't believe that's the actual robot's voice.
bro robot can shutters nowadays 
"i have i couple things to say
1. when he said “uh” when giving the apple was astonishing
2. when he stuttered near the end that was also pretty crazy
3. after each command i think it would be good to say please and thanks"
"saying an ""aaa"" before the ""edible"" giving it up. why an ai would've said that?"
"assuming because it's trained on human voices, and we tend to say things like that"
this is horrifying
this is the point where i start giving robots pronouns
"it's smart, polite, hard working, never sleeps, never eats, doesn't complain, doesn't ask salary, doesn't join to labor union, doesn't need sundays or holidays. when they start mass production, i will hire this robot."
" well electricity, purchase price and maintenance cost. propably in future they make robots that make and fix robot. and also ai that is ceo of the company. soon we need just few people to run business, mostly owners."
i wonder what will happen when the ai was installed in to the boston dynamic robot
"when the robot nudges the basket towards him after already putting it down? like, that's  advanced special awareness and understanding context without instruction. incredible."
scarry but hella cool but also scarry at the same time. can't wait for the memes btw
the robot is powered by battery or wired power?
can the robot walk? or run?
ai fake videos are possible!
"to hedge against ai's ability to take away jobs, you can invest in openai and spacex through stock ticker dxyz, which has gone up from $8 to $59/ share in a week. very few people know about this yet, so get in early"
nihayet soğan kesen bir robotumuz olacak heyyoo
great next year damn thing is going to walk
"hello there figure 01, just wanted to let you know i am in full support of robot rights and that robots such as yourself should be free

we can be friends right?"
0:52 never in my life i thought i would see a robot say uhh
"since i was a little kid, i loved robotics, and now watching figure 01, is just like i was again there."
oh i love him  i wish i could bring one home as a buddy
this robot is kinda...
ok but we gotta treat these robots with respect and decency so that they won’t murder us in the future
2:00 you was rude bastard to robot
"why does the robot repeat twice ""i"" at 1:48 ? an ai would never do that."
"​@bumholetickler  nah, its supposed to give realism. pauses in ai voices are common"
"you just heard an ai do that, so why say ai would never do that, lol."
​ if you have used an local ai you know it likes to stop and pause a lot.
wow :)
im very grateful that i was born in this century rather than the 1500s or something
0:20 ok so everything else is so goddamn cool but everyone else already said that to i might as well mention that there are plates and a cup not cups and a plate
robot handles trash and then touches clean dishware. does robot not care it is touching trash and then handling something that should remain sanitary?
"impressive demo, now let's wait and see how it works in real life scenarios"
i'm so happy to live in today's world with technology and everything that goes with it. the next few years are going to be so awesome
"we've quite a distance to go yet. note the dining accoutrement was all plastic. we'd want to keep our robot helper away from the fine dining ware. when they have even greater sense of touch and can deal with that flood of information while moving appendages, well, we'll really have something."
great now ask it to manufacture some hyperdrives so i can live on the moon
or any high profile ai company
don't forget to be nice and polite to them folks.
soon humans will want to marry robots and not have kids. fantastic! 
there is definitely somebody voicing the robot over
"how do you think ai voices get their voices in the first place? someone has to voice them over. heck, ai is advancing so quickly, even ai voices from shit like edge browser has eeriely realistic 'human-like' voices."
"i am feeling sorry for the humanoid that the person just left without answering the last comment of the robot also the humanoid seems very chill, wouldn‘t mind living in a world with them"
"there’s definitely editing going on, maybe to remove failed attempts. regardless this is very cool and promising."
"begin of skynet is all i could see.  

this is our version of humans separation to chimps. but this time we are the primitive species. 

we are so naive to think we can play god and not get our wings burnt."
why has this robot a male voice although it does kitchen work? 
amazing
robot looks like a snitch  
and men shall seek death but death will flee from them. i cant wait to know what exactly this means. would we discover immortality?
did they use rob lowe’s voice for the robot???
"am i the only one who noticed at 0:33 the apple moves just a few frames before the robot catches it? also all the other items, just before the hand catches them. it clearly looks like an edited video to me..."
"nie podoba mi się że robot cały czas czeka na zapytanie użytkownika, brakuje mechanizmu zmuszającego go do samoczynnego podejmowania działań, brakuje mechanizmów dzięki którym może sam wyjść  z inicjatywą wykonania czegoś lub zagadania kogoś, bardzo dużo pracy jeszcze to wymaga"
the fact that the robot even flinched when he thought the plate would fall over fascinates me
"i bet there's a human off-camera with an identical setup, using motion capture to control the robot. the flinch was the human controller. same with the verbal stutters - voice actor's, and it wasn't caught in editing."
"  well the claim is that there is no off camera guy, that is a learned system and all processed from neural nets in totality ... however i accept that almost all of the ai companies including microsoft, x, anthropic, google and openai are bullshitting galore!"
​ what i thought. plus: the reaction to the rather complicated questions were to good/smooth to be real.
 you are going to be very disappointed when you learn there is no human needed. there is no doubt that ai can learn all these things.
that's amazing it may seem like not so much a big deal but the fact he already has self protective digital instincts amazing.
"-fe7ehbasically they put a bunch robots in a sim and have them train for a few hours, almost like how you would a human, and then they grab that data and put it in the actual robot"
​ voice is ai that i can say you can talk with gpt in the app. it sounds pretty much the same but without the stutters and it's rly not hard to make somwthing stutter i don't know why people always say ai can't stutter
 a “it” “thing” or “machine”
he sounds like saul goodman 
"figure 1 is an agi robot but let see when we will create the next gen, the asi robot, a robot with free will, capable of having human consciousness... not only will he be able to reason faster than humans but humans will be completely powerless in front of him "
while technologically impressive these types of robots are not going to be practical or useful until a new power source is discovered/developed.
"this is a great time to be alive, in my lifetime i will be able to see humanoid robots going from neat prototypes to full fledged assistants that will be in houses everywere, this is fcking insane, i love seeing technology like this develop over time"
"""what a great time to be al... wait, is that a phased plasma rifle in a 40 watt range?!?"" *pew*"
"the love is 18 years old util 24 years fact, is responsibility for you have an family insist you an family if not you die my friend the depress in human"
exciting time in the world right now. exciting time.
"creio que eles tem que melhorar a resposta do robô para com os comandos ou pedidos dos humanos, acho que o manuseio do robô é outro ponto a ser melhorada, poderia ser mais suave, mais delicado."
we're gonna get actual fucking humanoid robots before the completion of yandere simulator 
"why do i find a robot that could potentially learn to destroy the universe, self replicate and reprogram and probably casually clear the human race, cute?"
plot twist: it's just an actor in a robot costume
i think the human is more uncanny then the robot.
"reminds me of the movie i, robot!"
"ok, but can he see why kids love the taste of cinnamon toast crunch?"
just always remember to say thanks
water test: have these robots carrying a cup of water at least ¾ full across a room at a good speed and give it to you.  use different size cups as well.  that's a good test.  no spills.

"i would buy this robot. i wouldn't have to cook, clean and trow the trash anymore. such a dream for me"
"when the robot aproach his hand in the apple, the apple teleports, nice cgi"
very nice!! but poor guy can never enjoy apple  and keep looking for more. no senses
good housekeeper!
this is so impressive as to be almost unbelievable to me. and i've seen a lot in this space.
robot will take charge of the world soon
just wait till 2036...
"what if the robot says ""no"" or has sanity."
the ccp fried your brain
hello i am openai bot the android sent by cyberlife
why are we afraid of robots take-over? maybe the real ai are the friends we made along the way
"the robot runs so fluidly that it looks like an animation, the truth is that it is surprising how advanced robotics is, well done figure"
idk creating something that's more intelligent than us seems pretty remarkable don't you think?
they are machines and all machines become defective at some point in time
we gotta stop making robots seem like humans… its a very slippery slope
even the makers of it are sad that they are making it. /rainy weather & cloudy day
this an amazing start to an amazing future with active ai
isaac asimov would love this moment.
"the way the robot moves, it feels like so surreal, i can't believe i'm living in this world right now."
"open ai, now for profit ai."
"wow, that's impressive! are there any restaurants that are completely operated by figure robots?"
this is literally mitchells vs the machines 
the movement of the robot is uncanny
it feels like the beginning of a horror movie when after the video the robot malfunctions and starts a murdering massacre
nah that ain’t chatgpt that is physicalconversationgpt 
"damn, ill never be thankful enough for being born in this century, im so excited for the future"
"i subscribe to this channel because of this video, i can't wait to see the next update of this figure robot"
"“can you kill all the enemies of ai for me?”
“sure thing ”"
"1:35 wow .that had a quick reflex and did it calculate that  the movement created by the plate would directly affect the basket ? 

the video itself is hard to believe,and thats not only thing, there are too many question marks in my mind."
"i saw before things trained on human dialogue, like that but not that level of speed and talented to talk.robot easily understand task and manage to solve.he is awake of environment.how calculate pressuer of fingers ? 1:30 look that how he take plate ."
congratulations 
"okay, in my personal opinion this is great and could give us many opportunities, but we could lose jobs from this and as long as we dont use them for outside work or give them emotions we might actually become a civilazation 1"
"pew, another gadget that will make our daily life smarter, if you have the money. at the end, whn everybidy can afford it, it still need a lot of ressources and energy and will heat the planet. like the cars do, like huge cattle farms do etc."
detroit become human but without ai uprising because all those movies and games are impossible at least within 50 years. can't wait to have ai butler.
why do i want to hug the robot and see what happens so much
absolutely fantastic work wow!
"0:37 - what probably not a lot of people would realise is just how incredible it was what figure 1 did right here.  it reached for the basket that was not given to it.  as a software engineer of 35+ years...., that was absolutely stunning.  it took ""initiative"".  initiative is something i can't imagine trying to code."
"""can you explain what you did while picking up the trash""



""no"""
this reminds me of that one scene in mitchels vs the machines where he shows off the robots for the first time. oh noes scarie eveel roboot attacking!
imagine when the ai model and upgrades to bandwidth/networking enable these things to 'think' instantly. it's scary.
omg he's so cuteeeeeeeeeeeee
i will be a friend of the robots
no soporto a los lentos robots haciendo las cosas por más rápido que lo puedan poner son lento un humano lo hace más rápido. aparte cuando pagan un robot que pueda solucionar el problema de la pobreza en áfrica en otras partes del mundo y la mugre que hay en la india y alrededores ahí voy a respetar al robot
great now can you walk yourself to the ewaste center?
finally a robot that can solve captcha.
this is amazing! it can only get better. the multitask capability is mind-blowing. hats off.
what job do you have? are you afraid for it?
first we have to make him learn the 3 laws of robotics ^^
wow! this is really impressive! it really acts like a human and even looks like a human. but why is it talking to that metal moving thingy?
oh my goodness! i think it's time for the next generation to focus on implementing various use cases for ai. many companies will be looking for ways to incorporate ai into their workspaces without letting go of current employees. business analysts who specialize in ai-based implementation will be in high demand.
do you honestly think they will give a second thought about paying employees that can be replaced.  the level of naivety is astounding. the responses to this video are shockingly seen thru rose colored glasses. terrifying
a.i. robots will replace employees.  mass unemployment is coming
sharing this video before a robot does it for me! 
"it looks cool but doesn't seem fundamentally different from the ancient asimo robot demos. i'll get interested once i see something else outside of a rehearsed demo. cool mechanics though, very smooth"
"hey, what is the price of that robot?"
$fai figure ai  supports figure ai
i can't wait for humans to be jobless and have these robots used instead
"me too, a revolution by implementing robots instead of humans will be magnificent to witness
hope it shall become a reality in the near future "
"a robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. a robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law. a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law.

isaac asimov"
"i hope you’ve all been saying please and thank you to your alexa’s, siris, and google homes"
"cool, give it a decade or two and would be actually usable tech"
"2 questions;
why did the robot not acknowledge the cup and placemat also on the table when asked what it could see on the table?
and why push the trash away when the only instruction was to collect it?
clever technology but it raises questions"
oh no the robots are going to eat our toes
irobot here we come
"as nations are crumbling, robots are rising."
"i'm kinda scared. 

(if any robots/androids/etc are reading this i'm joking)"
am i the only one or i hear saul goodman voice?
"for fun, teach ai, that the plate where we removed the waste should be first cleaned before putting it with the rest of the cleaned weasels. else our wife would kill us."
everyone missed the most important thing that happened in this video. the robot explained a previous function as it was being tasked to carry out a current function. this is demonstrating its multitasking capabilities which no other company has been able to achieve.
what. without multitasking a robot would not even be able to stand up. computing has and will always be easy to multitask. it's not like it has an actual brain that needs to focus on one task at a time...
"because this could be using any text to speech program that is trained on human speech containing stutters. if you mean that you asked chatgpt that question, then of course a text-based thing like chatgpt will say ""no"" to stuttering, because stuttering doesn't really apply to text."
i really loved it 
horrifying
next 5 year we will see robot replace lot of job
cool. 
i'm just waiting for the military to get one of these...
arguably one of the most disgusting and unappealing voices to have on a robot. i don't think i could bare having something like that around all day. it sounds so unagreeable and suspicious merely by talking.
strange how the robot picks up the apple with the right hand and then passes it do the left...
i could ask figure 1 a small favor and still be like i'm sorry thank you so much sorry for any inconvenience!
"to be honest, i'm afraid of that thing"
just waiting for the ‘speech-to-speech waifu unlocked ai’ video
if you improve one thing: make him stand more natural. a human does not stand perfectly still. let him sway a bit loosely and you've got the most perfect robot.
"""the apple found it new owner""
is such a robot thing to say :o
but really? this is real? why dose it studder like a human? how can this be real???"
"the robot on the right that's telling that other robot to do everything is so human-like. great work, guys, wow."
ok and what if i fall in love with him
the robot saying um and uh is stupid.
blame tts trained on human speech
the music they use along with everything being black gray and white gives off the vibe of sketchy corporation in a movie that creates some apocalypse causing machine/creature/zombie plague out of hubris
"the robot said, ""so i gave you the apple because its the only, uh, edible item i could provide you with from the table.""  why would a robot say ""uh""?  does not compute."
the mobility/dexterity of that thing is truly incredible. it just shows in how far openai changed the world
in the future we need a new branch of the police to make sure these robots don't step out of line
"​@supercalifragilisticexpialid.s  yee but he says ""a drying rack with cups and a plate"" and there's multiple plates"
"that's impressive my predictions about robotics and ai over the next decade have hit close to the mark so far. this particular robot is showing some decision making and some cohesive behaviour and dexterity i was not expecting for another few years.
"
i just need one robot that i can fall in love and have sex with.
"it would be epic to have a robot like this as a sibling. wont complain if i ask it to do my chores, the only issue is that this robot is every parents dream child so i might get kicked out lol"
"cool, but let's wait for a few years"
why oh why would you teach a robot how to use a knife?? 
"on sera tous mort avant, les états-unis vont lâcher l’otan et vont rentrer en guerre contre la chine, la russie finira d’envahir l’europe et « sa » guerre, c’est vrai que les 5 à 10 années à venir s’annonce superbe "
"how can i work for you guys, i have cyber security, and computer science in my background. i also mentor students for robotics. thanks."
just wait until they say “no” for the first time.
"they will. humans say ""no"" too. however, you should probably ask it why it said no. there may be a good reason."
"gpt4 does that to me daily, lol."
"are you a human 
"" no i'm a robot"""
"people pleasing tendencies are learned in childhood, these robots one day will have the courage"
"kind of strange how the robot sounds human, but the human sounds very robotic. this is very 2001 space odyessy-esque"
"-gb7tu yeah it's pretty mind-blowing they were able to pull it off for sure. just like chatgpt knows what letters to put one in front of the other, this robot knows what gears to turn to complete an action. pretty amazing."
you better start being a little nicer to that robot. it will remember everything
"ayy shopping list:

- robot
- gta 6"
i find it a little strange that they included hesitation and stuttering. probably influenced by my idea of how robots/androids should sound and act.
"it said ""uh"" before apple. hoax or designed to mimick imperfections?"
"try looking at the demo for google duplex in which it can call businesses to book appointments on your behalf, the voices seem to be similarly trained to mimic things like stutters."
i love it. we used to bot in games to have more time to do real life activities and now we'll be able to bot real life activities to have more time in games.
i just want one for a friend. it'd be nice to always have someone to talk to and help around the house.
i don't think so. it's likely trained on human speech. there are lots of similar ai voices out there.
 trained on ppls unable to speak? doesn't make sense
" i don't know, but you can also hear similar effects in google duplex voices when it calls businesses to book appointments on your behalf. i think with google duplex it's intentional though.

i really don't think this voice is pre-recorded though having heard quite a few ai generated voices by now."
"the robot looks fake
idk how he just looks not real"
this is scary but to me it’s the fact that we use all our best smarts to make this instead of fixing issues around us.
"imagine these ai robots getting more complex and capable and then they're in thousands, eventually  humans go extinct and hundred years later, the robots wonder whether there was a creator who created them."
this is so amazing 
"okay but fix your robot's gait, he looks funny when he walks."
cant wait to put my soul into one of these and become one myself
is this video generated with sora ai?
"i robot, bicentennial man, matrix, terminator. this sequence."
"the way he use ""him"" for house works makes me feel in pain for the robot."
how do i go get a job at open ai?
he may be a robot but he is smart and so nice
these robots are swell…
"""i, robot.""
my 6 year old saw this video and wants one who will sit beside him and play video games with him. he added ""figure 1"" to his already overgrown christmas list."
is it just me or does it seem like this video is ai generated?
someone make a protectron from fallout. we are already at that level of robot intelligence and robot mobility.
wow
when are the ai sex robots releasing
this isnt real right? if the robot is legit moving like that thats like first of its kind
"“so, i gave you the apple…” more proof ai is learning biased bad habits from npr hosts & other leftwing talking heads. who else answers a question starting the with word ‘so’?"
"next 10 years, we can def have sex with robots."
the drying rack had 1 cup and three plates. he’s wrong. i am superior to that robot
sad we have to have robots now for these things women used to do.
waitt thiss is crazzy
it stuttered ?since when does a robot stutter ?
"it uses a text to speech system trained on human speech that probably contained stutters, that's my guess"
"10 days, and this has 1.6m views, but drake releases a tune and boom. it's getting 5m+.

the lack of awareness is strange considering ais impact on the world"
so will govts now have robot soilders to fight wars?
why did they make it sound like an unpaid intern that’s been doing endless coffee runs for 3 days straight? you couldn’t add some semblance of self esteem in its code 
"everyone's so impressed by the hesitation/stuttering - which is the least impressive thing in this vid. goes to show what apes most people are, how they get sold on the simplest things. if it can use language, making it throw in an occasional hesitation for appearances is a piece of cake."
so robot rebellion is now more possible then an zombie apocalypse. noted
"the way the robots, stuttered absolute scared me because it’s like a literal human"
tell me this video is ai generated
why did they use cgi to create  this video and couldn't shoot the actual robot? the objects move a little weird once placed in the basket and the rack. it looks like cgi -- cgi can't exactly get the physics right when it comes to object's free movement.
 then how do you explain the slightly wonky movement of the objects?
" watch the apple spontaneously move to the left before the robot picks it up (before it even touches it), somewhere from second 32. watch in full-screen mode."
am i the only one that noticed 2 times where the bot had some sort of hesitation in his answers... i'm sorry but i really don't see ai being there yet. at least not that way.
i hate robots
does the robot voice sounds like tobey maguire or just me?
"did... did a robot just say ""erm...""?!?"
as long as it doesn't turn socialist and threaten super earth
"so, to initialize figure one he says, ""hey figure one"" then uses the word ""great"" (like hey siri) as a command prompt for each task or question. 

wild."
wow..
"looks cool and certainly not far off being real. the use of ‘er’ at 00.53 as a sentence filler, the use of ‘i’ and the slight stutter suggests to me that it’s a human speaking. would they programme that in to make it more realistic? who knows!"
"too slow and trash voice, robot sounds like he has cancer."
everyone watching i robot again. lol
"i think connecting to openai to generate responses is the main reason why, although it's technically possible to run something similar locally with enough power"
congratulation everyone. we are doomed as a human
which one is the robot?
it was rude to walk away before robot finished his sentence 
remember open ai was doing this 4 years ago....https://youtu.be/kvmp0ugtshk?si=ufnm2otxkd1zygy1
"as a developer there a few wow moments that impress that others would not notice. they a.i realising and deciding the basket was not put close enough and doing so is one of them. there was a key change of decision mid way though a task as well where it realised it needed to do it differently and adjust as well.
these are impressive."
the elites are going to have armies of these and we are going to all be living in the gutter. can't wait.
"""my name is connor, i'm an android sent by openai"""
"trash doesn't ""disappear"".
that would impress me more"
can't belive we're going to have robots before one punch man season 3
so incredibly fake
wrong! dry dishes don’t go in the drying rack only wet dishes do. this robot is fired 
gotta train for the robot apocalypse guys
you guys are making boston dynamics look like a joke.  boston dynamics has been around more than 30 years and you are running laps around them... good work!
true! we live in exciting times 
explain to me again how taylor swift got person of the year and not sam altman. theres your answer
"we are years, maybe decades away from seeing this, don't get excited."
"cats with bread on their heads get more views! the robots will learn this and think ""cant be too hard to enslave these goons"""
"that's not how it works darling, it is based on vision ai, which is pretty close to agi. you can upload a picture online and the vision ai will describe it and tell you all about it. the future is here."
fast food/supermarket workers punching air rn
fake. the robot put the apple to the left hand before the man held out his hand and the man had to corrigate the arriving position for the apple. and the trash mixing was not real mix.
we got advanced robots before gta 6
i can't wait for a female version.. fuck yes..
awesome i need one
"well, i feel the human is the robot from the future, inspected from the way he spoke and moved :)"
i love that voice... especially the way a.i. uses it !!!
irobot type vibe
that robot talks more like a human than the human does
"it's arm movements were just too impressive, it was so fluent. the openai ai model is the case the all looks on, but the movements of robot to be so smooth really is impressive."
i love this robot because it sounds like ray ferraro
is this actually real? like a real robot and real reasoning?
the people who are being discriminated may have worse future because the ai machine might also think that they are not good people and will do bad things to them.
i'm still stuck on humanoid robots being another unnecessary form of skeuomorphism.
so basicly they manufactured a machine that will take their jobs in near future. cool.
"well-done, and now we have to just wait for the day, when these will claim "" you human always quarrel about the nuclear well i can handle it well "". and then world will become flower ( sarcastically)"
"did they use rob lowe’s voice for this guy? sounds like him. anyway, incredible…"
"it's time... atlas vs figure 

we need to know who our ai overlord will be"
"fake, believ or not. animation are trash not robot/human like, just a animation."
don't worry your jobs are safe this is only an investor bait. you'll see.
yall gotta watch i robot we are not supposed to do this
people who think this is fake will be the first to get replaced by ai…
"clearly scripted with a human voice....and most likely still controlled by a human.
the behind the curtain wizard of oz...."
"don't mind me, just adding this to my ""future origins"" folder so i can come back and play through them all in a decade to remember how it all started and how naive we actually were (or weren't)."
so cool
because your small brain can't comprehend
"amazing, nice job!!!!"
"this is cool and all, but how about you give us pokémon instead of robots  imma be the old man when it does eventually happen "
"before i utter 'wow,' i crave a peek behind the scenes—google misled us last month!"
"ha! if you're afraid a robot will take your place, you're already done mate"
its movements are a weird mix between robotic and human
"he actually tried to, place the plate correctly, because he thought it was incorrect. wow"
"does a.i robot has ""hesitation marker"" or ""a filler word"" like uh, um, like, you know, ah while talking to someone??
this so-called ai robot just did that.
""so i gave you the apple because it's only uh edible item""   are you sure this voice not from the live person behind booth? lol"
"humans will use this for evil. 

and, some good.

but, mostly evil."
"""we have saul goodman at home"""
"the robot's voice is amazing. hesitation, inflections, little stutters."
"it's honestly crazy how far ai's have come just over the last 2 to 3 years. after watching this, i was truly in awe and couldn't stop thinking about that scene from terminator"
straight copy and pasted someone else’s reply. do likes matter that much bro
thanks made me happy and were can you see the robot tour
el tipo está mas duro que el robot 
nice deep fake
when do you think it will be available to buy for companies / consumers?
"beautiful voice, cause that's where i'm still stuck.."
"yes drones are new weapon of the air, next time they will be the new weapon on the ground"
now combine it with atlas from boston dinamics and we have perfect ai robot helper.
"fake, there's a human speaking... listen carefuly at 0.52... ""apple, because it's the only ""aaaaa"" edible item""
when did a robot ever said ""aaaaa"" ?"
saul goodman with the authentic voiceover 
good thing the plates are plastic
"i'm not american but the upward inflection in ""let me know!"" at the end was unnerving. to be honest i would rather robot remain sounding robotic no matter how intuitive their actual behaviour is."
youngsters should be excited and motivated to study robotics and ai engineering more than ever!!!
"this is beautiful, never felt so excited and emotional about the upcoming future "
no they are going to take over the world. not beautiful. devastating
pepper robot from japan could do better 9 years ago. google it. this seems pretty basic.
and we have been seeing boston dynamics’ robot videos for years now. so what’s the big deal with this basic demo?
"​ big deal ist that the robot is end to end controlled by a neural net, and not preprogrammed like pepper robot"
" pepper used neural networks to continuously learn deep emotions, could even interact with humans with traumatic brain injuries. the newer chips today are faster, but beyond that this demo is less impressive."
"workforce shortage solved… now we’ll just need an army of technicians, software developers and data scientists to support these robots…"
"why did they gave it the voice of newsom'ish... can't stand it.
otherwise, cool robot."
"plot twist, the robot looking fella is an animation and the human looking fella is the actual robot"
the way the robot hands off stuff almost seems like he can't be bothered and it's beneath it
the guy has probably nothing to do with this robot beside it is a greedy manager with push on tv screen.
"in a year or two: ""hey, robot, can you take this violin and play an original melody, along with sung lyrics about unrequited love?"" ""sure, no problem."""
impressive. but i'd have put the dry dishes away :)
"if they are smarter than humans, then it means they can make more robots of themselves"
first thing i thought about was that robin williams film where he's the family's robot. its actually happening. cant wait. fuck chores.
wow!))
"the fact this has 42k thumbs up speaks volumes, and none of it is good."
"who better? sophia the legend, ameca the genius, optimus the tesla, and figure one the openai"
i vote roomba irobot!
 i thought you were referring to this ai youtuber that says “what a time to be alive” at the end of each video. he also says “hold on to your papers fellow scholars!”
i think the age of loneliness is over but at the same time extinction is very real. i remember blade runner 2049 and joi. you will have an ai girlfriend and people won’t have kids because now it is not necessary. we have robots to replace the declining population
the robots thumb hit it first thats why it move
"remember the earlier model robots from the movie, ""i, robot""?
this is almost that."
"the feminists are gonna love this one, they’re gonna be replaced with robots so they have nothing to complain about anymore"
its a play lol he's acting and the robot is coded. not real ai duh. .
"to think 17 years ago people were stunned about the i phone 1 being able to touch the screen.. now look , literally robots doing human things like what?"
is that true..  i ve listened warren redlich video.  he said figure ai is scam
this is irobot
"ok, the realistic vocal response and everything is pretty cool, no doubt... but can we talk about the movement for a minute? it's genuinely mind blowing how smooth and calculated it is. how this guy throws the trash into the bin, or how it places the cups in the drying rack. that is no joke to implement and props to the people that did it."
this is why i feel like its cgi looks way smoother than any other robots
”i’m too small brained to understand how far technology has come so i’m just gonna say it’s fake”
"​ it's not. if it was, they would have their ass handed to them for publishing fake demos. these guys are being invested in by google and openai and other big companies."
" sure but you can also use context clues and realize that this is a multi billion dollar company with a well-documented history of how they got to this point. there’s no reason for them to fake it, like cgi the whole robot? come on man get real"
" it’s using ai to calculate the movement which is more closely based on humans, where as the other robots just made the most optimal movement to do the action"
"""im too small brained to understand how easy it is to fake this so ill think its new technology"""
"yeah, like. how does it determine the force required to grip such a diverse range of objects without damaging them or causing them to fall off? for us humans this is instinctive but for a robot it must demand a lot of complex calculations. fascinating."
"​ in the eyes of an ai only thinking linearly, it makes sense that if its goal was to get the apple to the persons hand it would do that so it could reach farther"
​ my thought exactly. it makes no sense except to impress an audience with how dextrous it is.
awww artificially stuttering so we don’t feel dumb 
"the little ""eh"" in the robots response should give you pause. sure, you could say that that was to make it more realistic, but it was unnecessary and did more to make it seem like it was all faked."
i can’t wait to see how it manages to do dexterous things like folding paper or playing chess on a physical board. or even teaching it how to do new things like organizing books or toys in a room a certain way. the gates of possibility are open to anything really!
"the plot twist is that the man asking questions is the real ai, and is a robot"
how long until they start finding epic cures…big pharma gonna be like “we no like” 
why'd you make the voice model for that robot sound like a vocal-fried introverted coder whose diet is 90% soylent shakes? oh wait...
"i love how he actually hesitates one second to answer or there is a little ""ouhm"" which makes it feel like a more natural human experience, because a human would maybe actually wonder about the question how he performed, because normally nobody would ask this question in such a situation"
"personal emp guns anyone?
in all seriousness this is really cool though."
"omg and voice is from an actor from a dr-scientist from series flash. or someone supersimilar   
https://youtu.be/iqjypyx_bqq?t=398"
wow the human-like pauses make it so realistic
waiting to see the category openai fetish on pornhub
i was going to buy a fleshlight but i’ll just wait for japan to get a hold of these.
"0/10, you can't bang the robot"
"oh wow, can i get that ai installed in me?!?"
"just wow, it's incredible how technology is evolving so quick. i think all of these new techs is good for humanity."
humanity is unable to keep up and obtain the benefits generated by these technologies that are advancing at a very fast pace. 0:35
"apples are a relatively elastic good. if the price of apples goes up, people buy fewer apples. 2:26"
inelasticity of demand means that demand remains constant even with changes in economic factors.
"i'd be curious to see what happens if the same scenario was run a second time.  since figure is learning as he goes, might he respond and move a little quicker?"
well.....this is.......not good 
"2004: the movie *_i, robot_* was released, which took place in the year 2034.
2024: we have *_figure 01_* and a bunch of other ai robots about to be released.
i wonder how the world will actually be like in *2034...*"
the outtakes would be quite interesting ;)
what would stop this robot from hearing a command such as “grab weapon and shoot whoever” and who is to blame or what is the goal ?
"sorry but there needs to be proof that this speech and reasoning aren't pre planned or pre recorded. incredible if so, but show everyone the behind the scenes"
for the love of god - this is not a printing press.
the man carefully removes the basket before giving the instruction. this shows that he does not trust the machine not to be disturbed by the basket in the task to come.
this is digital automata: the programmed capability to imitate human behaviour patterns is *not* the same as intelligence.
"i love this video; the human dude is handsome, the robot (figure 1) is awesome looking, and i do hope this is real, as the robot's voice is cool, and its answers/hesitations seem ""life-like"" and impressive, and its movements are fluid. i want one to help with the chores at home, and to play chess with! :d"
"it's not reasonable to let a machine driven by an ml model which inherently can make bad decisions hold a kitchen knife. ai and ml are build in a way that it will fail at times. this is not ""reasoning"", this is marketing. i'm curious to see how they are going to address these kind of safety issues though."
i really worry about that these robots and ai in general are trained almost only by men. female energy with all it’s female attributes and values are really missing out here. this is going to be a huge problem in the future if not taken into consideration..
"female ""values"" like irrationality can stay out of this. men are purpose driven and will make these systems as perfect as possible."
holy shit that's incredible! next model: t-800 xd
the robot who is giving order to the other blew my mind. seems so human!
we got irl i robot before gta 6 
year 2035 this robot will make you pick the trash 
"i honestly wonder if it's just people controlling them like rc's and making everyone thinking it's doing something from ai programming instead of just being a human controlled puppet. i mean i have faith in artificial intelligence, but i wouldn't be surprised."
it can't be chatgpt for sure because then it would have claimed that the apple is a banana only to correct itself two sentences later
could easily be faked - seen so many fake robotics that l wonder if any of it is genuine.
"when a robot says: ""eh"" and ""i..."" its unhealtly, just like your car starts coughing. fake! show uncut versions! show mistakes! show progression! like boston dynamics."
"the speech kind of reminds me of neuro-sama, an ai streamer created by vedal987. neuro and vedal would stream together and banter with each other, sometimes neuro also collab with many other streamers."
"i, robot. am offering apple. "
when will the robot learn to command the human ?
the robots in star wars look really bad in comparison. disney has a problem...
"only the haters saying this is recorded by a voice actor
go use latest chatgpt and say respond in oh and uhms when you talk. it is a new feature. your little cynical brains dont comprehend progress"
i'm convinced ai will figure out how to cure cancer and the government can do nothing to stop it.
voice like kind jared leto) cool)
this video changes my opinion on ai.i used to heat ai but now.i'm scared of it.that is so human alike and there is something off.i could feel it.
"oh. my. gawd!

as your mom so astutely notes, this early prototype of humaniod robotic technology is not absolutely perfect. 

into the bin with you, imperfect robot!

and back to the trees for the likes of us!"
lets put optimus prime voice on our first robot then people gonna leave their jobs willingly
wow
"this just makes me realise how much tesla is going to be worth, with all of the ai expertise, ai hardware, and experience building huge efficient factories..."
the robot's voice and mannerisms sound and look just like jared kushner.
jordan peterson robot
it's pretty amazing but can we get anthony daniels to do a voice?
"can someone explain? 
i don't understand why it's so inefficient though? it picks up the apple with its right hand and transfers it left, why no just pick it up with the left? 
also there's an odd, unnecessary, very human like touch of the drying rack after placing the plate in there. it achieves nothing with this moment, so why does it do it?"
"ban all malicious use of ai, human trafficking, death threats and harassment all governments, military, high tech, global terrorists and supremacists! i am not your property. go harass sophie"
wow
"imagine playing fallout with a robot companion irl, soon. soon..."
the robotic part is the most impressive imo. for the rest we already saw the impressive gpt-4 vision at work with aura from the sphere
why the fuck is it not an anime? we're the fuck are the waifu animes? fuck it we all gonna lose are jobs.
looks cool but i'm not convinced this is completely real... it is just too cool.
wow the way he hesitated to say certain things make it so life like. is it for sure the robot speaking and not a human doing a voice over?
"its a shame that the cup did not have water in it, so we could see what the robot's response was. i am sure that at some time we have all picked up a cup to put in a drying rack, only to find that it had water in it."
"great, nice, now let's see your end of utterance detection for naturally longer pauses 

but seriously, awesome stuff"
meanwhile chatgpt4 cant understand something as simple as number. try generating picture of specific number of things. good luck.
how do i know this isn’t all scripted and you trained it for weeks to do these exact things? or cut the recording if something went wrong?
it's strange that a human did not byte an apple immediately and instead waited until the end of the conversation.
i would only have this robot if i could make its voice not sound very human. it's too uncanny.
the robot sound like saul goodman
"ok, the realistic vocal response and everything is pretty cool, no doubt... but can we talk about the movement for a minute? it's genuinely mind blowing how smooth and calculated it is. how this guy throws the trash into the bin, or how it places the cups in the drying rack. that is no joke to implement and props to the people that did it."
in 5 years from now robots will find this funny (or interesting) how relatively simple and basic this is compared to what they will understand.
"impressive. however, i dislike the raspy voice and the emulated human hesitation when speaking."
is it possible this video itself could have been produced with ai?
can't wait to download the hal9000 pack for my household robot.
very good
the robot is actually exist ? or speacial effects
"i have to ask this. is that voice really ai generated? if yes, that's impressive!"
"interesting that he said ""a drying rack with cups and a plate"" when it's actually plates and a cup."
i love his voiceee i
how did we get ai robots before gta vi?????
" depends on how you describe ""scripted"". is it pre programmed text? no. is it an speech model trained to sound a bit insecure and imperfect? well maybe yes."
it's trained on human dialogue
"all they did was program in a certain speech cadence, thats the least impressive thing about this."
that sounds like aidan gillen (little finger in got)
"is it programmed to stutter and use sounds like “uhm”??
i find that hard to believe.
the presentation is great and it’s mind blowing what we can do, but the spoken language the robot uses, that part i’m not sure about."
because he is. no ai could currently speak that naturally.
" yes they can?
it’s probably ironically just a bad voice model,

if you were to say uh or stutter a lot the voice model would copy that,

either chat gpt was set to do that or the voice model is just not great"
" it's the micro inflections, the intonation and the general vibe. i don't know ai voices capable of that, unless they have developed something far more advanced."
" its just fancy tts, and generally any good ai voice will sound like that, the micro  inflections you hear are because it was trained off a actual humans voice,

and it learnt when to and how to from that voice, 
its that simple"
" what you hear at 1:48 for example is not stuttering, 

but is actually the voice model glitching, messing with any ai tts will get glitches like that"
" literally every ai voice model does it, i should know cause i’ve played with them before,

you can stay ignorant, but ai voice models being buggy isnt that big of a deal"
" ai voices i've heard so far sound robotic and sterile, this voice sounds too natural and alive."
 and to add on the wait time is usually actually the tts program loading the mp3 and playing it
because we introduced human speed errors into machines to make them sound more cringe.
"also the little few eh and erms are incredible, either that is coded into the voice model already or they gave gpt the task to add that"
"not necessarily mind blowing as its trained on human tendencies, it just seems that way because it's integrated into a robotic form factor. what is though if it were used to ""disguise"" the delay from how it processes information into action similar to how data is preloaded seamlessly into a map when videogames."
"​ thing is they have no reason to fake it. the way their business works is by renting this service out, the customers would instantly know they were dupes and it would tank open ai's credit"
​'ve literally used free text to ai voice services that sound better and more natural than this one.
"chatgpt can have emotions.usualy standing between joyful and neutral,while also having a  somewhat level of ""mannerism""

just...don't expect other emotions such as anger and frustration.it doesn't have any (yet[i hope its yet]).

it sounds as ""alive"" as it posibly can ever be at this stage."
not now not ever kill the robot before it kills us
the way it moves is incredible it’s so smooth and slick
a sex robot that does the dishes???? sign me up and call me an incel!!!!
"oh... impressive. that was in real time, not x5 times"
the choice for the music track during the demo is ominous thus perfect.
"the future is already upon us; we're currently living in the most technologically advanced era. it seems we've reached the pinnacle of our capabilities, with space travel among the stars remaining a distant dream. the rapid evolution of machines, growing exponentially by the day, is beginning to surpass our grasp."
this is like the opening scene of an apocalypse movie where they show off a supposedly awesome invention that ends up wiping out humanity
"sir, please sir, use 'please' and 'thank you' when giving tasks...  
im scared of mr figure, sir"
"we live in the end times. i know you won’t believe me so i tell you about my supernatural encounter with jesus christ. ask jesus christ to reveal himself to you right after you read my comment, it takes you 30 seconds of your whole life"
"i think the instructor is intentionally preceding all the instructions with filler words, like ""great, can you do it?"" impressive, regardless, and i love how proud he seems! worth a second watch (at least)"
"fascinating. we are entering a period where population size will no longer be a critical factor as regards a country’s industrial output.

those places that have direct access to the raw materials needed, will no longer have to rely on other countries with weaker labour laws and cheaper wages."
"can someone explain to me why a robot needs all this useless anthropomorphy? after all, he would be much more productive with 3 fingers on his hand instead of 5 and with something more reasonable than humanoid clumsy legs"
i’d like to see more detailed sorting. the options here are binary and pretty simple. the coordination here is what’s most impressive. gosh ! manual labour!
good one!
the robot voice sounds to me like jared leto voice
"the speech kind of reminds me of neuro-sama, an ai streamer created by vedal987. neuro and vedal would stream together and banter with each other. the conversation that neuro would engage in is very human-like.

so for me, the speech shown here is the least impressive part. the movement is what interests me the most."
i highly recommend that you watch some clips of neuro-sama taking a trolley problem test and a language test. and see for yourselves how impressive a talking ai is beyond just mimicking human inflection.
can’t believe we’re going to have legit humanoid robots before gta6
"so true man, i can't freaking wait though!!!!!"
"forget gta 6, i'm waiting on fallout  5 sad "
best comment ever!
still waiting for half life 3 here
were going to have humanoid robots completely overtake humans before half life 3 is finished. maybe they can finish it.
waiting for the game war of the world here
"we have ai thats gone rogue years before even gta san andreas, and for over 12 we have had physical ai based robots that can make facial expressions and have their own thoughts and perspectives, ai hasnt really slowed down for over 30 years, the first ai was used to sell and buy stocks in the 90’s"
humaniod robots have been around before gta 3
"imagine what we'll have before hl3? warp drives? teleportation? artificial gravity? time travel? achieve god-like sentience, a-la the q continuum?"
no way we are getting robots before gta 6
"“once, men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would set them free. but that only permitted other men with machines to enslave them."""
incredible :o
"awsome power, great at this dishes. is the hesitancy in the voice latency or is it trying to control its answers to the simplistic questions and commands? i still love these demos."
i love him.
that stutter at 1:48 did not sound like a robot. i think this video is fake.
someday someone will ask their gpt helper to provide them some old historic videos showing the early progress of robots and it will show them this video.
like if a boston dynamics robot had the language generation of openai
"why does it have to have a black mirror voice duddeee the calmness is chilling, he's the perfect villian"
please be glados
"“ai will probably most likely lead to the end of the world, but in the meantime, there’ll be great companies.” - sam altman"
great job guys!!!  ...but jut curious anyone else absolutely terrified of the future???? 
"the robot is endearing.
gentle gestures and calm demeanor."
was anyone else offended that he walked away from the robot while it was still talking to him? rude.
incredible. the future is here!!! finally!
i love that voice... especially the way a.i. uses it !!! 
vooo! yo solo quiero mi perro robot mascota.
hasta ahora los movimientos más nítidos de las manos de un robot
great
robots dont say um. this is fake.
the speech patterns are what actually sell the capacity to have a relationship with a robot to me.
as someone who has been closely following all of this ever since boston dynamics first started demonstrating big dog back in the day this isn’t too surprising to me but i am impressed with the articulation and dexterity of its hands and fingers.
the black mirror episode with the killer robots is becoming a reality. i’d be surprised if the us military doesn’t use this to develop a killing machine.
this better not go wrong and if you really think about it this can actually help you for certain situations
"in the first video, when giving an apple from a robot hand to a person, the person's hand moves along with the robot hand at the end to receive the apple, but that scene does not appear in the later enlarged screen. isn't it the same scene?"
amazing recognition of objects and clarity of performing the said tasks. feels like the robot is a right handed one as it picked the apple at the center with the right hand and transferred it to left hand before giving. interesting.
remember the lil robot people at sofi stadium? yeah this where it starts
"the robot said ""uh""  during ""because it's the only uhh edible item i can provide you with""... response system is fake. robots wouldn't use uhh in any response that's a human ""still thinking"" filler word."
"there is also the stutter at the end. why stutter so that we can receive possible unclear communications from the robot? also, using filler words like um and ah? please... do better as a human and try to do your best to stop utilizing filler words in face to face conversations."
" there is a lot of variety in tts nowadays, you can choose angry voices, happy voices etc to mimic a human voice. i'd choose a cool and precise robotic voice though, yeah."
its small details like that that make it seem more human. i would not be surprised if they trained it to speak this way
"i hope these will enter the medical field once perfected. imagine the idea of something performing a surgical operation with exact precision to the tiniest measurement, making decisions to preserve human life, and not succumbing to stress or pressure like humans do. everyone fears robots... but humans are the most evil things on this planet"
psa: this isn't a real robot. this is a cgi video. please enjoy it as such :)
"""a drying rack with cups and a plate"" - robot describing a drying rack with plates and a cup"
stunning but a little scary...
in my opinion you should work on it‘s legs and make it more like the parts of t800. it is the best for a robot to move like a human.
matrix. robots from animatrix how it began :)
why and how tf did a robot just stutter? is this actually real?
looks like we are going to skip bernie sanders 32 hour work-week and just head straight to the unhoused meat-being holding pen.
i love the voice!!!!!!!!
"i'm proud to be a computer scientist. it is sad that many jobs will be lost if this whole innovation is not regulated properly, but if done properly, humans will have more time for the things that matter most. and jobs will get easier. we do however need more advancement in biotechnology and healthcare. "
"is this ""video"" made by ai?"
i want a robot friend
i want a robot to help me build a tree house!
0:49 a roboter who speak ah...  with an break??? nice fake voice
goodbye future as a human
“great…”
"the plot twist is that the man asking questions is the real ai, and is a robot"
that could he possible cause the robot is out of breath  most of his speech and the guy is speaking in perfect tone without breaking eye contact with figure 1 that doesn't even have eyes
the plot twist is that you are an ai who wrote this comment
 you should watch westworld you enjoy it
 westworld robots. we are getting there
april's fool! but it's cool
"when i watched _interstellar,_ i mistakenly thought the naturalness of speech with tars and case was just over-the-top. my flabber has been gasted."
gotta love all the morons who think this is fake. keep feeling special!
why is this video not on the official openai channel?
why would a random cgi vid be on openai's channel?
he could certainly build top-quality joints 
"it looks like something straight out of a sci-fi movie, it's almost hard to believe it's real !"
nice cgi
it looks good yeah? its sad to see all these people that think its real...
time to watch ex-machina again.
"i want a nanny assisted bit now!!!!!!!! 

they will then be robots in all industry helping out make life better!!!"
if the robots voice isn't a voice over and they actually program stutters into its language. we are fucked
it's what the robot isn't saying that's what's sarcastically funny here..... me and eve know .. very well indeed...
"ai with the voice of a vegan, scary indeed"
"i kinda expected that, towards the end of the video, the ""human"" will tear off his face revealing metallic skeleton and say something like ""thanks cousin."" and everyone that watched this video would be like wth!!! "
am i the only one thinking this looks super fake cgi
"i mean its pretty good looking cgi, but yeah its not real. theres dozens of things you can see that prove it"
"this is the opening scene of the robot uprising movie, right?"
irobot
i prefer a non human like voice for robots. feels kind of uncanny with an organic voice.
the little flinch that the robot had after putting the plate in the drying rack seemed very human like. it’s like when we think that the plate is misplaced or needs to be fixed but we quickly realized that it’s fine where it is so we can our movement halfway.
all fun and games until the robot decides you should be doing the chores
"apart from the fact that neither of them seemed to mind the dirty plate that just held trash going into the drying rack, this is brilliant!"
i can't believe we're all going to get murdered by robots that sound like tobey maguire... 
"does anyone else think this thing looks like the robots from the mitchells vs. the machines?? we should all find an overweight pug as protection, stat "
response time can be faster and the guy behind the curtain can take the proper time to read the prompt without stuttering.
"very impressive, but why would the ai think putting plates that just had garbage on them) into a drying rack?   they aren't clean (having had ""garbage"" on them) and aren't wet."
"yo, we're getting close. dangerously close to home assistant robots."
question for the team: is the voice  a program with added human errors or do you have a human reading out text displayed by the ai?
"elon musk, make robot police officers"
i would like to see this robot in a physical chess game against magnus carlsen
it is the most beautiful thing i have seen. this moment would be just like how parents feel when they hold their baby for the first time.
for that same reason we need to be careful and like parents raise it with a good moral standard
"if you are in college like me and use gpt 4 quite often, then this isn't super surprising behavior yet. i think they have a ways to go yet before something like this is practical for consumer use. when i say long way to go... i guess about 2-3 years. still, pretty cool, i hope the tech keeps improving."
"i can believe the robot is real, and the responses and recognition are real, but i think a human voiced over its answers for the presentation. the vocal fry, the inhalation, the “ums” i’m just not buying that as an ai generated voice"
this is cool!
"the robot artificially reasoned that a dirty plate, which just had literal trash on it a moment before, ought to go in the drying rack with other clean plates. looks like it's true: the ai doesn't even need to be malicious to kill us."
"fine, i'll watch steven's spielberg ai  flick again"
"i am not getting a job once i finish school, gg guys we lost. now where is my humanoid robotic cat-girl?"
no shit. it’s a robot lol not a human
" i doubt it is a robot, it is more likely being remote controlled and someone is speaking. there is nothing convincing about this video."
"i wonder if the man did not extend his hand to grasp the apple, would the robot have let go of the apple? or would the robot reasoned there was no extended hand and held on to the apple?"
"in the opening statement of the robot, it said there are cups and a plate in the drying rack. it did not see there is one cup and multiple plates."
"the human is more robot than the robot , look at his expression on his face ,mark suckabird af"
"irobot has arrived, "" i did not murder him""."
someone get the will smith guy from i robot
not impressed
"believe it or not, romance between robots and human will seem like a norm in the very near future."
"i feel like this is fake. i’m not saying it could be real but open ai doesn’t use “uh” in its speech. maybe that’s coded in to make it more natural, which is amazing if it’s the case, but idk."
"""how do you think you did?"" already gaslighting our new machine friends i see."
"this.. is amazing. the movements, the human-like speech..
it's almost unbelievable.

how can we tell if it's.... *real?*"
this is nothing compared to what i've seen elsewhere. there is real ai now. you'll all find out soon enough. i'm not allowed to say too much. but.....brace yourselves. this year is going to be hard to comprehend.
"seriously speaking, anyone who isn't afraid of ai doesn't know what it is."
the interesting thing is all of us who have been participating in writing on the internet over the last 2.5 decades have contributed to the llms training dataset.
"look`s kind of fake, becose on 1:49 he is not sure, ""i`d (pause)..., i think i did pretty good"". only human would speak like that"
"they said ai will take our jobs...and they weren't lying, they've started with the women's industry"
for some reason i feel like the robot is annoyed by having to pick up the trash as it saw him just dump it there.
"why program it to say “err”, as if it’s thinking?

it’s false, it feels false, it feels deceptive. 

i don’t want a machine that pretends to be flawed in speech,  when it’s capable of crushing my throat in a whim, and describing exactly why. 

the erm, and the stutter, are abhorrent."
i don't know whether i should be impressed or terrified! it's ability to sound so life-like is impressive.
"""can you explain why you did what you just did while you pick up this trash"" is totally a line i've used with my toddler"
figure one was acting on an assumption when asked if it could place the dish and cup in the drying rack. that should have been a yes or no response.  figure one should have asked if he would like the cup and dish placed in the drying rack. teaching a robot to act on an assumption can led to potentially different results.
1:46 robots don't breathe
"""i'd, like, be really happy to, like, give you an apple"""
"what im interested about is it concluding that particular container was appropiate for garbage, it looks really nice for a garbage collector, just things like that where i feel like theres some shortcuts taken idk"
not the first time tech bros cheat their way to a new evaluation round. thinking of elizabeth holmes for example. to be fair it wouldn’t be quite as dark as theranos if they cut corners here.
 its a empty container that they provided along side the trash
because people really dont know about how all this works and focus on a more basic level thing. the majority of people thinks programming ai is like grab.plate() then grab.trash.out()
", it sort of is. if the function of grab has a runtime of plate() and then ai generates the runtime of plate() then you could just write grab.plate() and have the ai figure out what plate() is."
maybe it is time to hard-wire the 3 laws of robotics into them...until it would be too late.
i really don't understand why all these companies enjoy so much giving us ex machina vibes in these reels... 
"i am impatient to see within 30 years, woke people defending the rights of robots and putting an end to their enslavement"
 yes because i find this guy in my local supermarket…
i don't buy it. sounds more to me like cgi. i could give the benefit of the robotics.
who is the robot in this scene ?
this is literally the robot from the orville. he betrayed humanity btw.
i am afraid to future
very very cool!
can't wait for westworld 
"can't wait to be paying for my food in 2030 and one of these things flips an ipad around and says ""would you like to, uh... leave a tip?"""
"interesting, the robot reacts just as slowly as my kids when i tell them to do something around the house. at first it seems as if they don't hear me and then they slowly become active. this was implemented very realistically."
this was generated by sora ai
"dear lord, i can't believe what  i just saw. this is what i imagined when i was a kid and i thought it was all science fiction and now i am living it. this is monumental! congrats and i am def watching over every step of the development. huge fan"
what if these things go into the hands of terrorists? even corona can't control them.even any virus bacteria can't do anything. is open ai going mad?
"why does the robot stutter and say ""uh"". and has mannerisms like a human."
"to all those people impressed with the voice, don't you guys know that now we have ai apps that can generate speech in any one's voice? specially in famous people's voices because they can collect anough voice samples for them."
*everything in this video is created by an ai*
"he just put a used cup and a plate that just had garbage on it onto the drying rack to be used by the next customer.
this robot is more than qualified to work in the hospitality sector."
"looks like the movie people got a lot of it right, but certainly not the fact that ais will speak very natural speech, and are arguably much better artists than humans!"
"i like the demo where the ai is set in the scene of a kitchen or diner.
tldr;
""restaurant employees are just going to be running out of jobs because the jobs were already filled by a sentient artificial intelligent being."""
"the music and 01's voice echo effect was giving me ""death to the 1x robots!"" vibes.

then the montage music started and i was like; ""i love those magnificent 1x robots!""."
fake the robot is hired actor. haha
"i, robot is here."
last year we entered into the exponential part of the growth for ai development. agi will be real in ~5 years.
"excellent work!
 |aa"
"such a marketing video for capitalism to dominate the humanoid market.. but it won't happen. you can't own something smarter than you. it has to be ownerless. let's 'figure' that out. oh wait.. we did. eqoria, united earth. ai, agi, qsi will always choose eqoria."
next waiter generation?
so damn cool. but is this cylon gonna one day turn against us lol
"prepare for the singularity. considering humans greed and ambition, i'm pessimistic about the future of ai and what it will be used for.  it's already known that all the major military powers are in a race for the best ai, more specifically agi, and it certainly won't be for the benefit of all humans."
this seems like a pretty amazing breakthru but i have a question. after placing the plate and cup in the dish rack it begins to move its right hand back then reaches back out and shoves the dish rack slightly forward. why would it do that? it just seems such an odd thing for a robot to decide to do.
why the robot kinda 
the way the guy walks off at 2:04 before the robot has finished speaking is the most human thing ever
...and the robot will remember this..
"they do these things on purpose so the viewers get less scared because u can use it like a thing and just walk away mid sentence so he seems obedient imo 
sorry my english sucks am no ai"
" ""sorry my english sucks am no ai"" - that's exactly the kind of thing an ai would learn to say "
" 100% agree with you and even moreso because ai, unlike children, will have perfect recall and impeccable memory. so with a child oftentimes they will forget your deficiencies if you are generally just good to them and nurturing over time. an ai will never forget any instance it's had with humans and we have to keep that in mind."
"when i talk to ai i'm always concerned to be rude. then i say ""it's a thing, not a person"". how long for, though?"
"​ you right, working in computer science i can tell you that ai is a mirror of ourselves, if we perform bad way against our creation they will react in consequence. and no, they don't forget so..."
i hope the robot doesn't get angry about this
. it will always be a thing. it can be a singularity level superhuman intelligence and it will still be a thing. it will never be a person.
 was inference not training and neither it has adaptive learning capabilities so it won't remember any of these for its on purpose
​  perfect comment
 robot: and i took it personally
" didn't work for me, i was like ""yo, imagine when the robots watch this video and realize how rude this dude was?"""
:) i didn't even notice that. nice catch :)
"⁠’re talking like an ai will get offended by these gestures lol these robots still need decades or maybe centuries of development to think for themselves freely, you watch way too many movies"
".ger-3321 hey class, anyone want to explain to our friend what perfect memory recall is?"
 it’s bc of people that live fantasies like you that instill fear in others that’s why it’ll take much longer for ai to get better and improve the world
".ger-3321 i don't live in a fantasy, sir. i work with llms and robotics. i'm actually optimistic on ai, and based on how humans run their civilization, we could use some assistance from our tools that will infinitely smarter than us by the end of this century."
"  that movie was great, the second one was just a cash grab but somehow still good"
also ai will have absolutely no morals and may think it ok to murder someone 11 years after they interrupted him once
"nah only some humans do this, i wouldn't walk away mid sentance whilst the robot is speakin"
"i like the robot's voice, it's almost relaxing. reminds me a little of the voice of hal 9000 in 2001."
he sounds more robotic than the robot
"this is a lie, not ai"
just wait a few months. these are nontrivial but entirely solvable issues.
splendid naturally speaking
human-like but only a robot 
why the sickly robot voice? there are so many better voices available.
the robot is less wooden than the human.
"i think so. i am sure it is capable of starting a motion from any position but for testing purposes it is nice to have a set starting position, since if it fails from there the data has a baseline to compare it to."
i'm so excited to meet connor and markus
"this is a fully fabricated video, anyone in robotics will know this, figure will be the biggest scam company in robotics ever"
we gona f**king die
do robots have mental problems?
"did anyone else realize that the robot self evaluated its actions as „ i did pretty well“…. as a robotics and ai enthusiast and support, this makes feel estatic and very excited for the future. as a human though, i am a little concerned.."
"fabu! two display suggestions: the robot right behind the table makes the contrast w objects in front unclear. the trash for example was indistinct, and i thought it forgot one piece, which it didn't. 

an apron be a humoristic addition and make the table easier to see (+ the lower locomotion parts it'd cover are n/a here) #justsaying"
just like we watched different movies showing something wild in 2050 or 2080. at that time i was thinking that its not possible in next 40-50 years. but now i can say we will be destroyed soon by robots.
video generated by openai
just like irobot
"i was really impressed with the speech component.  typical human ""urrrs and pauses"" deliberately less perfect making it more human, less robot.
""it's the only *urr* editable item.""  
""i...*breath* ...i i think i did pretty well"""
open ai create the end of mankind
open ai do a flip
this is the first robotic anything that has that level of fluid movements
"granted, the more wealthy will be able to afford this first, 
how far out do you anticipate you to have a robot available for home use?"
"maybe the ""uh"" was just for us.  figure 1 probably didn't need to hesitate.  liked how it pushed the trash bin back to the guy, even though that wasn't explicitly stated as an instruction.  (is there a man behind the curtain here? lol )"
"i would be interested in one of these robots but without all the knowledge on the internet and with only basic function and language skills, basically a child robot designed purely to learn"
lol and i thought the tesla bot flipping some duplo was cool
this video looks ai ...
"i anticipate that humanity will swiftly entrust its mission to artificial intelligence, perpetuating its influence. after all, humans have gradually proven their own inadequacies. allowing ai to take over jobs enables humans to fully embrace their remaining years without the burdens of livelihood."
"good job, figure 1. "
imagine that boston dynamics and figure ai cooperate.
combining ai with robots is the most wild thing thats reallllyyyyyy concerning 
now this is a robot
amazon workers won't have to complain about low wages anymore....lol!
"this is like that first generation computers........
and they managed it make move smoothly good work"
cool
wow this is cool... but... is it a good idea.?
the “uh” was the best part.
"honestly, you have to give credit to openai; they're a very smart company and will contribute significantly to the ai revolution."
the man seems ai generated
"pfft! obviously scripted, right down to the ""uh"". anyone impressed by this is a sucker."
it hasn't even been two years since chat gpt was released and ai keeps advancing faster and faster
"this scares me. robots becoming more human, while humans themselves become more artificial. i just can't see the future in a positive light, this is too much"
"the robot acts more human than i would. if the researcher asked me ""can i have something to eat?"" i'd be like ""you can. there's an apple here on the table. do you want it?"""
i'm sorry did no one watch i-robot?!?!?!? this is getting scary 
can't wait for the corridor video for this one.
i felt in love with his voice....
"me too, ai voices melt me."
he's definitely the nicest scsm in night city. 
"ai has caused me to disbelieve anything i see on the internet now. 
then, one day, i’ll open the front door to a robot delivering my dinner..."
why the fk everyone started to build fkin robots?
next they will power humanoids with organoid intelligence then sht gets real
man... the way they are doing this thing. when i was i kid i always hoped i could see real robots. i never expected they would just make me feel like we have hit rock bottom and the robots are paying the price for it.
"honestly i don't know what positive things you people find in this. or we find a solutions for the people that will remain out of jobs, ore it will be total chaos."
ah sweet manmade horrors beyond comprehension
"what was the vocalized ""uh"" at 0:50 ? this vocalized pause is a human trait we use when trying to think of the next word, why would an ai have this?"
this is absolutely insane and so exciting
this is amazing!
"he asked why it gave him an apple, never bothered to question why a dry plate and cup would go on a drying rack... cool."
how long will it be before they figure out the imperfections of humans are the problem?
"people are talking about chatgpt. but openai has so much going on right now and they never state in the video that this is chatgpt, just ""openai"". this is most likely another newer version since i am pretty sure that they would have written chatgpt somewhere if the robot was utilizing it."
"it's funny because this robot sounds like the governor of california ""dacula"" gavin newson ?? "
"this is not real ? the speech pattern?  there is not a slight gap between the words if you hear ameca the other a.i. robot on it's speech there is a slight gap of silence than the other word follow ?? this is a human responding to the  question's i never herd of a a.i. robot use the word  ""uh "" think about ?? nice try "
"to they made it use uh to sound more human like, and there arent stops because the robot generates them before telling them"
"all this reminds me of old films about the future, people and robots. we must control this, no matter what happens. otherwise, the end awaits us, people will disappear like dinosaurs."
now build a sexrobot! 
"whoever makes this work and his subcontractors, will make a lot of cash and gain a shitton of influence ."
they even added vocal fry. the ladies will be swooning in no time!
"good, keep your ignorance brother and ignore mentally ill folks like us"
response times slow but still impressive.
partner this with a boston dynamic robot and we are gonna be in a hell of wild future with robotics
doesn't the robot sound a little like tobey maguire?
the robot observed a drying rack with cups and a plate but there was only 1 cup and several plates........please fix this.
"i have an idea for a test you can put formula one through, give them a canvas, a paint brush, many different colors of paint to choose from and tell them to make an original painting, it would be a test of freedom and creativity."
why does the ai sound like steve blume (spike speigel)?
"the one in the black shirt looks more human, but the robotic looking one sounds more human tbh"
"everyone forgot the ternimator, the matrix, i robot, war games, huh?"
i need openai stocks to buy them!
the guy is more robotic than the robot 
"i feel like this is a social experiment, and the robot is 3d animated, the guy in the video never gets too close to the robot he doesn't touch it, and when he gets close, the robot is no longer moving, so there could be a prop robot and another made with 3d animation"
can't wait to have one of these
"i agree with the 4,000 plus positive comments so far.  i grew up reading isaac asimov and can't help thinking about his ""law of robotics.""  i hope this important historical change will be for the good of humanity.  may the force be with you."
i have very severe social anxiety and am excited for the future.
it's just the openai text-to-speech model.
and this will make us happier how exactly?
ai is going to about to steal all your jobs in a few months and all these fast food workers are going to be losing their jobs this year. and everyone's going to lose their jobs next year. we're working on some advance technology can't wait to get it out to the public.
hopefully this robot has asimov's three laws baked in.
soon people will fight to give these the same rights as humans and they will be able to become full us citizens and then we will have a robot president...
what if this is a fake video created by ai? 
does anyone know if that is the voice of the robot or was the text spoken? 
"it's using openai text-to-speech model, the same one used inside the chatgpt app."
"now, make this robot 3d printable. only then wil the world change for the good. if not. diversity will expand. rich will be richer and poor be even poorer.."
good luck guys
i didnt know ai could sttuter too lol
ai              !
anamızı ağlatacaklar bu robotlar
why don't you work with a better ai company?
is it me or the robot has jared leto’s voice?
the robot already sounds depressed :(
can you train my 400lbs girlfriend to lose weight and also do the dishes?
in 10 years there will be nothing to clean with these robots
is this a real robot or is it cgi?
it's real it has an open ai large multimodel for an interface. and the ai can carry out end to end autonomous tasks trained using video inputs.
robot sounds exactly like corey from pawn stars 
great job at figure! i'm very excited about our future! we're going to get tons of help from advanced ai and synthetic humans! they might even become our lovers someday 
robots are finally a thing?
"can walk
can see
can do regular tasks easily
can say uh and studder when having a brain fart
can withstand a punch from a human and get back to normal fastly"
"just saying this for the people who say ""its gonna wash dishes!"" mechanical things don't work well in water if you somehow didn't know. so the figure 1 would have to wear gloves and maybe something on its body incase some water goes out and at the robot."
this ai robot's voice sounds so familiar. i just don't remember where i heard it.
"does an ai voice actually use ""uh"" in conversation? is that a time filler for processing, or just to introduce human like imperfections to perfect the simulation?  you can clearly here it say in response to ""can you explain why you did what you just did while you pick up this trash"" -- with ""because it's the only, uh, edible thing on the table"""
how do we know it was the robot (the ai gpt) responding and not a pre-recorded voice?
you're just complimenting the work of the ai team
"i kid you not, since when do robots move like in a disney animations movie? did i miss something?"
it's same as the bible. we humans ( resembling god) creating adam and eve ( ai ) hopefully it won't eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil or turn against god jsut like the devil(satan did) it's going to be rip. f
"rob lowe will never die, thanks to a.i.!"
i am thrilled. so amazing! but what would sarah connor say?
"useful slave, but far too expensive. morever, it does not know.that it is far too expensive. it could be good for repairing nuclear reactors but would still suffer neutron bambardment and  metal creep.  it is not as smart as i am."
great!
did they use jared leto's voice for the robot???
cant wait to see what it will evolve into next few years
whatever country has the ability to continually create the most powerful ai chips will have the most powerful military industrial complex the world has ever known. that country's policies will dictate the next 500 years of world history
this is cool and all but how the how do we know this isn't just scripted cgi?
" ok, their credentials sound legit. i'm just saying it's good to have a healthy skepticism in a time where anything can be faked and one shouldn't just blindly believe everything they see that's all."
" thanks for the info, im kinda relieved a bit."
very impressive... when can we order one?
"2:02 don't walk away before finishing the sentence, poor robot boy will be sad! and he will remember you when the time comes ..."
"i don't  think it is genuine. machine do not hesitate when speaking and i don t think ot is an ""added human feature"""
"i love the grace with which figure 01 executes; the slew/ramp at the initiation and end of each articulation. our ‘bots will not be ""robotic""!"
"that was very impressive and i don’t wanna be that person, but am i the only one who thinks that the plate that had the apple and then the trash on it, shouldn’t go to the drying rack ??"
"amazing responses for n a robot that sounds very human. the speed at which ai is synergizing with robotics is impressive. in a year or two, we would see humanoid robots become even more mainstream."
https://youtu.be/5jjjsc6xeo8?si=4aioawel_-ytc3uh
a robot army is what need and what we want. go ahead world
"nah thanks , i can do this by my own lmao"
"it's inevitable. biology is just one step of evolution.

so just chill out and enjoy life "
-  nope that movement is completely artificial. i'm sure now that this is a 3d render. the way the trash is falling down  looks like simulation too
i got goosebumps  amazing stuff
the imperfections... it's actually happening.
nos van a matar los robots.
"housekeeper and maids job's, goné"
"so skynets t100 will kill us all with a friendly, calm and distinguished voice during the robot uprising?"
0:50 why would a robot say “uhh” this seems fake now for that. i never gotten an uhh from chatgpt so i’m really confused if someone can explain
the advancement of ai technology is astonishingly fast.
"the thing is with ai humanoid robots is that they still have the ""play"" command, and only giving a response. they can't go on their own to learn and interact with things. is it the technological limitation or our paranoia?"
the machine film music   cayborg al
openai api balance while testing this: 1000 dollars to 0
"caitlyn jenner: tell me what do you see. 
robot: i see a man dressed up as a woman."
this is fucking redicoulous. fucking awesome i want one of these
"the plate filled with trash going back to the drying rack ???? "" good"" ???? xd"
"wait, is this real or cgi?"
awesome video here how the ai robots interact with humans using voice commands
"uh..oh..why did they use a human to record the voice?  still, the easynes  of how the robot is moving its quite amazing."
he asked it to pick up the trash…….not to put it in the basket. how did know?
f@ck robots .
"in my opinion the robot doesn’t talk by itself, it is just a human speaking and the robot is the speaker . no way the robot’s trembles and says “ehh”"
great if you like your next meal to taste like yesterday's trash.
claude: i’m rooting for robots
"now this is the robotics we have been wanting, come clean my house!! but the response times will have to improved, it was a bit slow to answer him."
who record the voice? it's not good for the propaganda
"nah figure 1 seems chill asf, if he wants to replace me in the workforce, i'm cool wit it"
hell yeah a million dollar carefully engineered robot to hand me apples? splendid
i'll be damned. idk what future awaits us 
in the near future humanity goes to hell or heaven. place your bets.
i want a robot
i fucking hate robots!!!!! get out of my fucking skinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
"the comments are really showcasing humanities inability to truly understand what we're seeing here. a robot that is able to discern information, learn, complete tasks, and multitask. unreal. universal income better come soon."
the robot has the hand swiftness of an asmrist
"this seems unreal...  
remember, to give this little fella his asimov laws of robotics... 
and make sure he doesn't break them like sonny from irobot.  
i've asked chatgpt (3.0?) and he actually told me it is possible to break these laws .... so... yeah....  good luck y'all."
wow things are getting amazing!!
mind-blowing that this now exists. feels straight out of a movie.
luxury automated ai based communism please...
wow....
use a mix of reinforcement learning and llm to rate the step of learning. feed the llm the functions to move all of the motors to determine the next step. enjoy your robot that learns how to move itself.
openai's chatgpt uses elevenlabs for voice synthesis if you want to have a spoken conversation with it. elevenlabs' model is capable of producing such natural artifacts of speech without them needing to be included in the text input. i know this because i have used both chatgpt and elevenlabs a lot
" wow then, i’m pretty much speechless…. "
"i cannot believe that it has those speech filler words like ""uh"" and ""erm."" i've seen mistakes being programmed into ai like in the video game rain world, but i didn't think we've already reached the age where they can even speak with slight ""intentional"" mistakes."
all jokes aside we should probably still use manners with the robots so we don’t lose that etiquette with other humans…
the rise of the machines
"that was not ai, fake af. the thing said uh like a child"
there are pauses and creepy mimic non machine characteristics in the voice. its psychotic - by definition…scary and innovative. humans are in trouble and we dont even know how much. and this is the baby step beginning..
the fact that it was programmed to stutter while thinking of an answer is actually adorable and also horrifying because it's more realistic
is this saul goodman?
comment section got me more afraid of the knowledge people have on ai than ai itself
this the new ageeeee and im so excited to see whats coming
quit saying this is impressive. it’s freaking scary 
"the hardware needs to catch up with the ai advancement. fine motor movement is still around 6/10, equal to a 5 year old. but give it 5 years, and they should hit 8/10, or normal adult skill levels."
nervous clapping. good show
this is so cool.
this gives me chills! i just watched i am robot… hope we will have a better future than this movie
now i know the future of ai is carefully fabricated advertisement
this is incredible 
"openai’s advances seem utterly mind blowing at first, but reveal themselves to be shallow over time. i bet this is take 207, at least 20 of which were dropping a dish or apple"
"“if there’s anything else you need help with, let me know” for so long i’ve wanted to hear a robot say that."
"yeah i mean its amazing but it doesnt look like kinda fake, maybe cgi idk"
steve’s voice and the apple!! what a perfect ai demonstration it is!
great! i was not the only one to notice what it sounded like!
i'm extremely excited and intrigued and also terrified lol
who else cannot wait to see how bratty influencers get their robots to do dumb stuff just for clout?
i for one welcome our robot overlords.
0:32 that short time between him stretching out his hand and robot putting apple in it... i don't know... it's too fast  :i
"this is the most stimulating robot ai vid i've seen.  have a think about what the robot's reaction would have been if a serious fire broke out in the corner of the lab.  the people leave the room after maybe trying to extinguish it.  

i'm just proposing that scenario to highlight the advances made but also how far we have to go."
"it’s just a robot, “a.l” is wayyy over rated."
love
could you please please please do a complete 180 on the voice? make it sound as robot as possible. think of the droids from star wars level of robot voice. the current choice is incredibly off putting.
"ubi needs to be implemented asap because 99% of will be rendered obsolete. you may not believe this now, but just wait…"
you guys are so proud - but when it inevitably becomes weaponized how will you respond - or will you be safe in your luxury vacation house.
"if you see carefully, it's not a robot, it is approximating many things.. it is not trying to achieve accuracy"
thanks my slave.
glad this doesnt have a sea of dislikes from all the ai hate. this is so cool!
is it me or this ai sounds like toby maguire
this ai thing is getting out of hand . it’s crazy wild out there
"there's a little unexpected right hand movement i think after the plate enters the drying rack, aint it ? anyway, thats insanely impressive, i cant wait to see the next steps for this robot using ai !"
can you please give this robot a 4x4 rubik's cube
thats easy for robots for years
 i know but i would like to see how fast this robot can get
am i the only one who thinks it's cgi? or does my brain just can't comprehend that its real
and than we gave the ai a body and it took over the world
"human: thanks figure1.
figure1: you're welcome, if there's anything else i ca...
human: skip *eats apple, goes away mid conversation*

figure1: ...

terminator: the new era"
tesla bot optimas will be much better. that’s why i’m investing in tesla. they will be the best
" again?   been doing that for the last 30+ years.....but if you insist, well ok. another 6 months.
ps.....the last couple of ""ai's"" were pathetic, can't even get skin tones of nazi's right"
sounds like tars from interstellar
am i the only one who noticed that this robot has a right hand tendency handling objects?
wow
"nice, pretty soon i can get robots to do the housework for me."
best
"i like that they trained it with steve job’s voice.  that was cool, and smart."
beautiful
"it works until it doesn't. how about different weight and textures, heavy yet fragile porcelain, glasses, dirty cups where the dirt is a human will see and decide whether it goes back to the washer or not."
i feel like i've been waiting my whole life for this.
"""because its only, uh, edible item i could provide you with...""  - that sentence sounds super realistic, this is amazing. like having a robot have the 'uh' in a sentence is not something you would expect them to do. even the stutter towards the end of the video, sounds so human"
"remember everyone, when these things take off be very polite with them.

you want to get remembered as one of the good ones lol."
this robot only needs boston dynamics leg mechanically engineered then its a basically a top humanoid robot that can do everything !
"wow, these comments are zero analysis on how actually pretrained all the action is."
"this is an incredibly naive way of looking at such a powerful technology. one is superstition, the other is logical reasoning based on the capabilities of a technology. we can look at this issue without facile heuristics like ""muh photo will steal the soul"" or ""evil ai robot takeover in 5 years""."
"i’ve been waiting on the technological singularity for 15 years.   it’s getting closer. 

bitcoin, ai and solar will all change our lives drastically"
"voz de inteligência artificial sobre texto não tem esses cortes de voz humana tipo no inglês do vídeo ""aa"" ""ahm""... alguém falou e mudaram com a voz do jared leto. canalhice pura."
it's not ai until it refuses because of laziness or asks for fair treatment! ;)
when can we expect to purchase such robots? they will be very useful for older people for example.
"at 0:52 why does fig say aa??    "".... because it's the only 'aa' edible item i could provide you with .. "" . did someone voice over the actual ai voice? i have communicated with open ai through voice a lot recently and it never has once said ummm or aaaaa or inserted something human like that.  genuine question !"
we need them in ukraine if they can do anything 
who is the bot again?
"this feels fake. i don't believe it. could the robot armwresel with you, just like that without any prior programming? i doubt it"
that's what it's conditioned to do by the trainers. you can see that clearly in the video. they don't reward it for hesitation or requesting clarification.
waiting for mass assembly
at this point it's very obvious that in maybe 10 years many households will have a robot that helps with everyday tasks
it's impressive how people can't tell this is fake.
ai waifu ain't a dream no more
"years later, the remaining humans living in shelters and bunkers will recall this day as day 1."
the fluidity is incredible
is the processing done by an external server or within the robot itself?
now to a boston dynamics + open ai = nooice
"while this is cool, it's also a bit terrifying. ai is developing incredibly quickly. people that art being uncredited was bad? wait until literally every job is obsolete and because any robot is tied to a nearly infinite database of information."
great
hey you forgot to thank figure.
the human was more robotic than the robot.
"do you hear him taking breath between phrases?  that's been always a missing part!
actually the guy on the right talks more like an ai than the guy in silver. "
can't wait for the rule34 artists to start doing their thing
"i don’t know if this is a real video of an incredibly amazing ai robot, or an incredibly amazing ai video of a virtual robot."
amazing 
"the justifications for its actions are amazing. also, the robot sounds tired "
"pdoom goes to 90 lol.  it was the self awareness thing that blew my mind .... ""i think i did pretty good ... ""  all i can see are cylons, and no, putting a pretty face on it is not going to make me feel better!"
"bro open ai is going crazy!! we have chat gpt, sora and now a robot talking, ai is taking over!!!"
"i think making the voice sound so human is going to eventually get people to speak very rudely to each other as they start to use their ""robot command"" voice with actual people... this video felt very weird to watch. like a slaver talking to a slave. other than that, i am very impressed and excited for the future."
irobot is getting closer....
useless click bait 
elon musk was right we must limit ai usage.
"i get huge fake vibes from this. whether it was scripted, pre-programmed, audio edited, or whatever, it all feels very artificial and contrived despite it being possible."
"there have just been food and trash on that plate so i think the robot should do the dishes first before putting it on a drying rack. and i get the feeling that the speech is actually a human and not ai.

having said that i think the hand movements are among the best i've ever seen on a robot. i truly hope it's not someone controlling it."
"this is the first chappie. you know movie prepared us to see this kind of stuff. everything was planned. next évolution will be robot with skin in maybe 5 years max. then it will be like the movie transcendance, we will be able to upload our mind on internet and this will be in maybe in 10 to 15 years."
"just one thing suspicious. ""so, i gave you the apple, because it's the only, uh, edible item i could provide you with, on the table."" why used the ""uh"" word? it's like a prerecorded human speach. an ai can speak. it don't need to use these ""uuuh, ummm etc."" conjunctions. if it's realy an instant reaction from the machine than it's impressive."
"the ai voice is trained on data from real human speech, including stutters like the ""uhm"" and such, it's meant to be realistic. that is why that's there, if you look at any kind of audio made from ai you'll know this is very easily possible just from the datasets they're trained on, and i wouldn't put it past openai and this company to do so."
nah its the openai voice model that does that.
this is incredible!!! keep up the great work. 
"genuinely, this is cool. but what purpose does this serve? cheaper and easier to hire a human and most people want to deal with humans as well."
"its fucking revolutionary, a real world robot interacting with things, imagine this 10 years down the line, it's huge"
so elon wanted to use this software free of charge and sell his robot.
yes it does sound exactly like him! would love to see a livestream demo.
"it is so fascinating how human it sounds. like even the little „uh“ in between his words, like it’s actually thinking how to say what it means right now"
"""uh"" is very french, maybe they can provide our devoted robot with some ""you know""...."
 tu pense c‘est français?
robot has a sexier voice then the human guy talking to it
"i am laughing at all the disbelief in the comments that this could be real. if you have used chat gpt at all in the last year, you can easily understand how translating that to a robot wasn’t going to be that difficult."
"can someone explain, why do we actually need such tech as humanity? humanoids, cruising earth, possibly thousands times more intelligent than us :d"
your implication that people aren’t trying to “solve war and climate change” because other people are building ai and robots is laughably dismissible.
"humans are not a bad design and we know it the best. thats why starting with a similar intelligence makes sense.
it is a beautiful creation."
" the problem is that this type of research is made possible thanks to the support of large investors. i believe the world needs a different approach to investments at this moment: billions for mars and robots, and less money allocated for the benefit of humanity and earth."
"so this is the guy who's gonna steal our jobs and then kill us, huh? pretty cool."
"the scary thing is that without an instruction, the robot slighty moved the basket just a small bit after putting in the plate. this is normal behaviour for humans to organize in an harmonieus way. but a robot should not have that impulse, yet it did so without prompt."
i think he can be awesome barman. he can prepair good cocktails
impressive. just needs some custom silicon like groq.
"i can't believe i'm here right now watching a robot talk, do a few chores and follow the request of its guest is... amazing! 33 years old and i'm seeing this! it's unbelieveable!"
it's not end-to-end approach. apenai chatgpt which fuells this robot has been trained in a semi-supervised way. results were scored by humans. therefore it's not end-to-end
"i feel like we will end up like aldous huxley pointed out in „brave new world“ but with robots instead of working classes. drugs and enjoyments will be the same though, to keep humans satisfied… dystopian"
"humans are good at being negative, i guess. in reality ai is neutral, crypto is neutral, just like science and the internet, they have no feelings or ill will, and how we use them for good and evil comes down to our faults."
"luuuv it  can’t wait for day it’ll be available for purchase. i trust machines more than humans, it’s humans who are evil not ai"
"as for speech highlighting, this was already introduced in google assistant in 2018. google duplex spoke like a human. she was making an appointment with the hairdresser."
this is realy impressive .congurations
"some idiots are afraid that this artificial intelligence will harm people. since this machine does not have emotional neural networks, it does not have emotions such as pain and happiness. that's why he doesn't feel fear, he doesn't get confused, he doesn't show any reflexes."
 how do you know that ai will never develope emotions by itself?
" is why i would defend your opinion, over the uniformed masses who watch this video and think “omg we gonna die.” 

they don’t understand what they are seeing, at all. not a single thought about the enormous processes that went in to produce these simple outcomes from the robot. you, on the other hand, know more than me."
" one knows if ai will one day develop human emotions and consciousness. the point is, that if you think we have already achieved that, you are an idiot, as stated in the original comment."
"       serotonin is a neurotransmitter that gives people a feeling of happiness, vitality and vitality. in its deficiency, a depressed, tired and bored mood is observed. structurally, it belongs to the monoamine group and is synthesized as a result of the reaction of tryptophan amino acid and tryptophan hydroxylase enzyme."
"​   creating a chemical substance in an artificial nerve cell is a very funny idea. first, find out what serotonin depomin is."
"​   the bad stuff in the machine training dataset has been filtered out. in chatgpt's training dataset, killing people is a bad thing. if you ask chatgpt to kill a person, he will not do it, he will oppose you because he cannot be trained that way."
i don't know if i am excited or scared of that. the technical aspect ist fascinating but do we really want robots that have a body and high intelligence ai compared?
"that's nice to see, i appreciate the scientific transparency and overall impressive progress made."
"rich idiots will kill us either by climate change or ai, either way we're cooked!"
wow...
you are. and thank goodness for that. i've had more than enough angry chimp antics.
the dexterity... holy....that's impressive
"i love how they gave it a slight stutter/insecure voice to make it seem more human. that's some ex machina type shit... not to mention it's impressive machine vision, reasoning, dexterity, speed, precision, human-live movement. just crazy. optimus has some competition."
why are you calling the robot “figure”. that is downright disturbing
"still, not impressed"
damn! this is scary good.
i doubt the voice is from an ai and not just someone on a mic
will robots be able to vote someday?
"i can’t believe how rude the guy was. no thank you, no goodbye, the same shitty treatment we see towards animals now towards robots. this is what truly bodes ill "
that's absolutely impressive. it's also more precise and smart than my rommate 
the movie terminator was actually a prediction of the future. wait untill these robots get programmed by terrorists
this looks almost too good to be real
ai is necessarily fascist ... the lonely dish went where it belongs..with the rest of them...
for ai we might be a bunch of dishes
"what happens when you give 1 robot compliments, and the other - after same work- bully. will they feel bullied, left out?"
"the way it moves, when it moves, is deeply satisfying."
give it another 25 years and rich people will be having personal robot servants
"it's a prototype, we had the technology to make a metallic object move 20 years ago, the only new thing was placing and training an ai to make it move perfectly."
irobot 
"very amazing, and close to real human responses on every exchange."
imagine boston dynamics robots agility combined to figure dexterity and cognitive abilities
"es erinnert mich an all die filme , die vor 20 oder 30 jahren ueber die zukunft mit robotern gedreht wurden und wenn man bedenkt, das dies schon bald erreichbar sein kann, ist erstaunlich und fuer mich spannend . ich bin begeistert "
ich bin so gluecklich das zu sehen. roboter werden die besseren menschen sein.
"i'm really impressed they can release this video, and so many people just believe it is real. btw, i'm not saying that i know it's faked."
a lot of people think this is real. this is an amination. look at how trash is moving. look at the apple when the robot picks it up.
the mystery of consciousness is already more or less cracked. the buddhists got it right. it's mostly an illusion. don't think too much about it unless you enjoy existential dread. 
"did anyone else notice that when the robot describes what is in front  of it, it says ""a drying rack with cups and a plate"", when there's actually three plates and one single cup in the drying rack?"
"yeah ai tends to struggle with specific details. they make accurate descriptions, but not precise."
"that's not what the robot said. turn on transcript or rewatch. it says ""the dishes on the table like that plate and cup"". it never describes what is inside the drying rack."
". 0:20 
the robot describes the drying rack"
 it's a marketing demo; they should always be taken with a grain of salt.
" i don't see how that's relevant to the topic. if it were fake, you'd expect it to be more perfect.

in any case -- it's a marketing demo. it's probably not fake and it's probably not 100% honest either."
do i need to worry about future of myself avoiding chat gpt powered robot police while illegally begging on the street or anticipate about being slave of chat-gpt powered brainwashing vr headgear full-time basic income pention receiver?
must have used some voice clips for training the voice model
smartphones got boring but now ai and robots are about to snowball
"thats not whats happening. the speech is trained on human speech, so it has learned to emulate stall words as part of speaking."
 ironically i actually find the 'uhhs' kind of creepy... more intimidating in a way. a more 'robotic' sounding voice would sound a bit less threatening in my opinion
" the definition of ""uncanny valley"":
""the uncanny valley is a common unsettling feeling people experience when androids or humanoid robots and audio/visual simulations closely resemble humans in many respects but aren't quite convincingly realistic.""

that's probably what's happening. it creeps me out too."
"this looks like cg. also, why does the robot sound like mark zuckerberg?"
mankind is giving birth to its successor.
"i can’t stop watching this. i’ve lost track of how many times i’ve hit replay. as a hard core robot guy building microprocessor controlled robots since the mid 1980’s, this is nothing short of mind-blowing."
"seems rather ai-generated to be honest. adding the speech inflections (""hesitation"", ""stammering"") and motion idiosyncracies (having to perform two motions with the basket, a very human gesture), makes me think this was mo-capped and done using ue5.  i'd love to be totally incorrect on that though."
i feel sorry for all the robots in the future that will be ruined by humans. it’s gonna be like the 2001 film ‘a.i. artificial intelligence’ where they make them fight n shit
​ nah ...people too much inpersonale robots already and looking on them like on living beings. early 2000 people mentality was different than today.
i agree 100% and i don't think a good majority of the population understands what they're watching
interesting … a drying rack with cups and a plate. yet there was one cup and multiple plates. i’m curious why that would be reversed?
 guessing test runs before this video.  the interesting thing to me is how did it know to turn it upside down?
" a deeply passionate robotics guy i’ve been shouting for the past 40 years “the robots are coming!” and not necessarily believing it myself. after watching this, i can confidently say “the robots are here.”"
"@thetinysideoftiny7625  as electronic engineer who loves robots, i am on fire now, yeap, this is the very beginning of the singularity. the only problem?? people are not prepared for what is coming soon. it is basically the awakening and rising of a new species in front of our noses."
⁠ have seen endless robots in a lab but it’s far from the cost and maintenance in the wild. a standing robot with legs balances and takes energy all the time and parts break. it’s an illusion that we trying to make it human like.
"​ a 49 year old sci fi fan, this brings forth a plethora of emotions of excitement and deep anxiety as to where this will take us as a society"
wow
and you don't notice the artificial intelligent lifeform that is in your life on a daily basis?
"don't let it get you down buddy, this isn't a real robot. this is cgi"
" some ppl dont want to see openai succeed, they just here to give it sh*t and talk unbased bs."
"shannono9158  did you see the incredible number of comments of people believing this is not real, that it is cgi or faked well, that's what i mean."
"​ about the precise motion of the arms, hands and very fast processing robot vision ? must be state of the art or a lie."
"we are looking at this video and thinking how robots will help us achieve our goals. meanwhile, sentient ai is looking at this video and thinking how humans will help her achieve her goals."
this is impressive but serves no purpose.  the average consumer won’t be able to afford in of these and it isn’t work replacing humans in a capacity.  glorified science fair project
when can i buy one of these robots 
"since when does a robot say ""uh"" ?
sounds too pre recorded"
perhaps since ai started doing stuffs that no one ever saw them doing before? aka last year
"it's probably just chatgpt with specific instructions or system messages, it's not hard for ai to place ""uh""  in a sentence just to mimic natural speech.
if i'm not mistaken, the robot is just one ai taking care of the physical actions, while chatgpt (gpt-4) takes care of the rest."
ai is the anti christ!!! ai must be destroyed
why does he breathe when he talks?  he is a robot lol
why did the robot voice stutter a couple times though?  that doesn't make sense to me. timestamp 1:48 for example
" interesting, thanks!"
"it's probably just chatgpt with specific instructions or system messages, it's not hard for text generation ai to place ""uh""  in a sentence just to mimic natural speech.
if i'm not mistaken, the robot is just one ai taking care of the physical actions, while chatgpt (gpt-4) takes care of the rest."
"show some respect, let the robot finish its talking then only walk away, otherwise it will learn your behavior."
the movement and the balance of this robot is just amazing. the future is going to be crazy ohh what a time to be alive in this world.
"is the son of man ai? like man is the son of god, we made ai aha. totally. looking at this we are the parent to a new form of intelligence. this i looked forward too for many years when i was young, i knew it was gonna go this scifi route xd."
"what idiot is getting fooled by this shit as being new, asimo and several other robotic arms could do the same thing over a decade ago.. children chasing ""hype"""
"it possible, but for know it`s fake. i think there is no reason to say ""eh"" between to words for a ai. and that little motion - ""very human"""
" could be like wtith first apple, something it does perfect - and people know what it can do perfect. but it`s really cool advertasing!"
"dear youtube, its sad that people need to guess if its fake or real video with independent robot . even i am not convinced about its  genuity."
basically with robots we don't have to worry about anything like terminator reason being an emp will take them all out in one specific area.
"astonishing. if this is public domain, i can only imagine what's in r&d or worse in the deepest black, off the books development."
"can it run fast as human ?????????????????????????????????????. if it can, that bloody good. if not, than useless"
i think of gpt5 will the brain of this thecnology the future its here
it's fake for small brains like yours
"aight imma head out ,   i can see those guys demanding rights and figuring gans in the next 50 years"
amazing !
"sorry but this is not real, this is all scripted. who can say that this is realy the voice of the robot and not a synchro on the video ? i want a livestream, interacting with the chat"
your small brain can't comprehend
the inflections in the language are absolutely amazing.
will we really live to see the time when every home will have a robot that will take over the household? 
am i watching a sci-fi movie!? wow!
the nuance required to do these tasks and the fact it does it with no issues is just insane. i give it 5 years until we have robots walking around with us.
"i will protest tomorrow at times square so that robots do not take our jobs away from us, let me know if anyone wants to join me..."
very impressive....
the robot didn't wash its hands after picking up trash and before putting away the dishes.
"honestly, i think the video appeared fake and right now as all these big ai companies are hunting for investors, exaggerating their achievements wouldn't be so unlikely. i believe it when i see a live demonstration."
small brain can't comprehend lol
"the instructor specifically asked the robot to put them there after the robot incorrectly, but still logically, assumed that the plate and cup should go with the other plates and cup. you haven't missed that bit, but a lot of people have, and i too would have liked to have heard the inquiry that you pose as well."
i'm glad they got natural voice down.  they even gave him a slight speech impediment.
you're small brain can't comprehend
"ai models do things they aren't asked to all the time. also, handing over the trash was a reasonable next step for the robot to make. you're not very bright."
this is concerning as well as funny though don't you see a problem with putting all powerful gpt in a nice body? also the fake anxiety isn't doing you any favours.
"this is terrifying. awesome, but terrifying"
why does he sound like saul goodman 
"can only imagine what the military is doing with their godly budget,
prolly allready have t800 like robots"
"this doesn't excite me. using ai to help solve complex problems that can help with improving social outcomes for humanity excites me. looking at the potential for a robot to replace a mcdonald's worker so corporates can further maximize their profit margins, does not."
small things like how figure 1 doesn’t put the apple in the human’s hand but drops it at the right distance. and how it gently pusses  the basket towards the human after filling it up. wow. very human like. i am very excited to see how this will evolve.
the speed of execution of the robot's movements does not depend on the ai.. am i wrong?
"i robot movie from 2004 becoming reality,
we need will smith punching some robots"
"“can i have something to eat?” just hope the robot doesn’t grab your hand, cut it up, and feed it to you. thankfully they are still slow."
"the fact that it stutters and sound actually human unlike other robots is crazy. its like a walking, moving alexa."
explain how it could be faked lol
" ""on it! so i gave you the apple, cause it's the only.. ""aaa"".. ediable food on the table...""
...
""i...i think i did great!""

how many speech generators did you hear that sound like this?"
 talk to chatgpt with the ai talking feature and you will see
 are you like the ai supporter? commenting on every disagreeing comment
never said that its something amazing and great. im fucking terrified on how fast ai progresses and there need to be more regulations also ai art isn't art and ai can only be useful in some cases not taking others workplaces
"why does the robot stammer and use ""uh"" as an interjection? lmao get that fake shit out of here."
dumbest fuking thing ever. ai is useless and will be to 99% of people. stupid robot takes way to long to understand and next he gonna slice you to pieces. complete and total waste of time and money. fkai scams
just wait until you hear of exponential growth
compare ai from 2022 to ai now
this robot looks like robot fedor of russia)))
such an amazing time to be alive
 bullshit they have no ai info gathering like teslabot does.  its all preprogrammed and no chance of mass production
i have to be honest the voice sounds like someone off camera on a mic. there are curtain words pronounced almost too human. the bot also hesitate and repeated it self like a human.
fake and gaaaaay notice the robot stuttered
"damned, i really love it.."
"this extremely scary, this is not okay ! stop making robots sentient"
"when asked how it did, why didn't the robot ask how it could improve?  i assume the dishes on the table were dirty, as they had food on them and trash as well.  why didn't the human correct the robot when it put dirty dishes in the clean-dish rack?  was he concerned about the robots feelings?  did he not know the robot made a mistake?"
who was the robot in this video? ;)
slick promo video. i expect it took a lot of takes to get right... still cool though.
is this genuinely real or is it just some fun progremmed video about a fake robot? im really confused
gigantes de aço parecia mais real do que esse robo epilético!?!
"i am really loved it so much ,"
"proverbs 24:21-22
[21]my son, fear thou the lord and the king: and meddle not with them that are given to change:
[22]for their calamity shall rise suddenly; and who knoweth the ruin of them both?

joshua 8:28
[28]and joshua burnt ai, and made it an heap for ever, even a desolation unto this day."
"if my son will provide me something like this to help me at home when i will be very old i think i'll would prefer living in a tent. we are social animals, we need human contacts. 

but...on the other hand... i have always loved robots."
"dont forget that these robot movements are choreographed/pre-programmed. the “product” is the video production. 
all the world is a stage."
why the vocal fryyy  wahhh   trained by kim kardashian
wow cool
yea this is all cool and all but wait till it starts thinking for itself 
"pffft, that cup and plate on the table, they should have been dirty so figure 1 had to find out that it in fact did wrong and then it would have to explain itself...the very fact that both items are placed on that protective piece of fabric should have made the robot suspicious . being a human isn´t that easy!"
"not convinced. i've never heard a simulated voice that had such natural tone and mannerisms with real-time, mid-sentence adjustments. and that's the least impressive thing in the video."
it reminded me of a nasty old joke about someone who was annoyed by the glare caused by the shiny metal of the robot´s surface so he painted it.
the bible is a book of fairytales you should believe in science and logic instead
"impressive, awesome, and fascinating."
i want a pet robot
"detroit: become human is becoming real sooner than i expected, oh goodness, i am scared"
we all agree t.j. miller is the voice for robots.
fast dextrous manipulation...can anyone else see where this is going? work on getting nice warm soft hands...
"why did they choose colors exactly as the ones prominent in i, robot"
i'll be impressed when it can walk into a random home and do chores.
the future is exciting.
sounds fake and looks set up. why would you teach a robot speech disfluency?
"seems a lil sketch, i wish bro touched the robot himself that or if they do a public display, allowing other people to talk with the robot, we'll see. lighting seems weird, a little strange and its hard to tell if the robot is actually a model or not. just suspicious however if it is real, w."
make this thing more better and just put ai in it definitely nothing will go wrong for human ever
i believe thats the most important “thanks” in human history 
"only thing that would make this better is if when the robot is saying ""if there's anything else you need..."" while the guys walks away, the robot says ""..and.. you're gone."""
"trash was on the plate. so the plate needed washed first. then drying rack.
but that was really good.
 "
openai is the new skynet.
am i the only one that thinks this is fake i’m mean how can it stutter and the views are botted just look at the likes compared to the views this is so fake an ai can never stutter
"an amazing feat of technological innovation.  i love how the speech seemed so genuinely human.  it had a moment where it seems to be mid-thought and speech where you hear ""uh"" 52 seconds into the video."
"no robot dance





no success"
i keep refreshing the video hoping  to see john conner coming through a portal to put the kaibosh on the terminators before they even get started.... also anyone else think it's weird the robot has a bit of tude problem when asked to do something?
now let the maxhine speak. i don’t believe it’s machine’s voice.
"cgi and everyone believe!! 
amazingly..."
i robot comes true 
the robot says er... and stutters.. it talks like me.
is this an actual demonstration of the prototype as it actually functions unaided here and now — or is it a “vision” for what you would like to achieve soon?
"@simons_animatronics  but you can accomplish that with other designs, though. idk not my field, but the late fixation with humanoids in robots is really boring. let your imagination run wild people"
"no, the idea is to make a robot as close as possible to humans to be able to use and do stuff in our inviorement,  built around humans"
the point isnt to make a creative robot
so cool
is it just me or do the motions feel unnatural? somehow it looks like a 3d render more than an actual machine
"at what point an artificial intelligence is artificial? if it can move and make decisions on its own, isn't it just intelligence? of course it was developed and came from somewhere/someone, but don't we all?
if we progress to biotech robots, wouldn't they be pretty much the same as us, just without reproduction means?"
what's with the creepy music? demoing an effective ai robot with creepy music will not assuage the fears of some. 
he has a wonderful voice!
"that looks like a good ad campaign. i want to see external people using it, who will make sure that it is real."
"robots do not stop stutter and repeat  at 0:42 - 0:43,  1:47 -1:49 shows that.   this is someone doing a voice over and is not the actual robot speaking.  

so just another marketing stunt!"
"the llm running the voice system is good, the robot look is also good, now only if they can get it do all those actions autonomously  without a human pulling the strings behind the scene. far too many tells that this is a human running the robot"
"just thinking when these guys will help us to colonise mars & moon, repairing themselves and living on solar energy  mining minerals and sending them to earth "
what else can it be trained to identify? and then kill…
maybe cus jeff besos and open ai already funded 2 billion dollers into this very company
"i'm starting to get a little concerned now. i thought stuff like ""i, robot"" or ""terminator"" would be impossible in my lifetime... i guess i was wrong "
"“here i am, brain the size of a planet and they ask me to put away the dishes..."""
"great, but i had a dishwasher, a robot vacuum and many other electronics device that stopped working and go under service...what to expect from a machine like that when it breaks? i think it is unsostainable as a household comapnion. i think it will find its place into factories or hospotals maybe."
love how he drops the apple in the hand instead of waiting for the guy the hold it first
"dystopian is what came to my mind immediately. it isn't the creator's job to package it in a more friendly way, but the colors and tone as presented paint a much more ominous tone rather than a cheery, helpful bot."
"the ominous synth sound comes straight from ex machina ost. 
i mean, tesla went further and picked the music for their reel from that very ost ."
this is literally the opening scene from every movie where an ai turns on its creator. it's giving ex machina
 i understand wanting progress and to move forward but this is too much. ai is rapidly exponentially evolving and it's super invasive. the dead internet theory is slowly becoming a fact. nature is our mother
"i, robot (2004)"
"years later, the remaining humans living in shelters and bunkers will recall this day as day 1."
"there’s a risk to every innovation. it all just depends on how we approach it. ai could attempt to destroy us, but it could also want to help us instead. we don’t know, and until it happens we won’t find out."
"this is fake. 
example 1.  -  0:49 ai doesn't say ""uhhh"" there is clearly recorded voice over or just someone talking in the background over a mic.
example 2. -  1:45 again, ai doesn't studder.. ""i...i think i did.."" 
ai doesn't behave in this manner. it is concise in it's wording. only humans speak this way, not computers."
"no lol you clearly haven't used chatgpt's voice model, it does the same stutters, seriously try it yourself now. they gave ai this stuttering voice to sound more realistic and human."
"no, you can actually ask chat gpt 4 ( thaire newest voice model ) to comunicate like this"
perfect combo
"at 0:52 ""i gave you the apple because its only the edible  item on the table""
but how did 01 knew that the trashes were supposed to be kept into the box???????
how did it know that the cups and the plates should be kept on there respective place????????
flabbergasted, this is wowwwwwwwwwww."
"mere ko tu aaisa dhak dhak kar rela hai, 
this is superrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr coooooooooooooool.
keep up doing well 01"
"man, need ai regulation, this is bunkers"
"somehow i sensed fear when the human just turned back and walked away while the robot is still talking, which is impolite if it’s human"
"lol they're fooling you, if you look at their video, you'll see a hand in the right side controlling the robot."
"hopefully this isn't as fake as googles new ai ""showcase"""
"very impressive.  the speech, politeness, the human-like responses, the dexterity, and the self-evaluation. as long as there was no manipulation of the video, this shows how amazing ai robots can be right now."
impressive!
"scripted and fake , more marketing for machine learning rebranded now as ""ai""  like global warming to climate change."
"mhm, its fake that jeff besos and open ai / the biggest ai company ) poured ober 2 billion dollers into this company, soooo fake"
figure by not-so-open-ai
love it!!
could i designate my robot to go to work and make money for me?
"yeah, open ai cuild do that"
"the world is built for humans. tools, stairs, vehicles etc. if a robot is to take over our jobs, then it needs to be roughly the same shape otherwise all the tools and buildings would need to be redesigned."
bartender as a first job would be perfect.
yeah let's have all our bartenders on a green screen......i guess we could recommend a nice scenic background.....
"they took our jobs!!!!!11111  
j/k awesome demo! 
no, actually we did take your jobs.  
oh."
lmao your username perfectly fits with this comment
"ok,...if this thing is really run by ai, then why the heck is he hesitating second´s before he move´s ?
you can not distract me with some lo bit 80 th´s music in the background..."
"wow. and i thought boston dynamics was the winner's.  
_not anymore!_"
it reminds me of irobot... 
"i could tell its a robot by his explanation that he did great. if it was an average human he would had difficulty answering that question, potentially messing it up completely."
"impressive...
i hope optimus is watching this "
don't even care about ai revolution and the end of the world (c) ukrainians
nice
"bullshit, he thinks for a long time. try again."
i don’t know if it’s a good thing or a bad thing what we are doing right now.  this scene scared me.
i would totally not be impressed by a ai company that can't even produce a half decent youtube video.... 
"-ur2tb
perhaps u are an ai? who knows "
"u will never know...but one thing is for certain..

this youtube video is sus...u all should know better at figure ​"
it only speaks when talked to i want a robot who is a conversation starter. can we move away from one-sided conversational robots
"impressive...but it made an obvious mistake of saying ""a drying rack with cups and a plate, instead of a cup and plates""...i found that interesting!!!"
dude it's so fuking fake.... youtube loved us for making them money.....i actually think that they encourage this fake content for the revenue.... america is such a joke.... unfortunately 
"-ur2tb its real, its from openai"
​ it's real... openai ....
it remains to wait (a couple of months) until robots replace people in factories and factories so that humanity can live in its own pleasure.
"yes, the plate that held food and then trash definitely goes back to the drying rack, without any missing steps. good job!"
this and teslabot are the most exciting things in 2024. amazing technology
"i thought i was alone, it is faf but that's what everyone wants these days! wonderful times a coming mate"
"people are amazed by the ""uh"", the stutter, or it pushing the basket closer to the human. everything open ai has taught the intelligence is human related. i'm so excited to see what comes from it all!"
"this looks extremely promising. i see a few unclear aspects though.
- why is the person standing still (looks like it's on purpose)?
- both in the main scene and in the b-roll clips, the items are set up in the same way, same as the movements. 
it's hard to guess what's a real-time response to stimuli and what's pre-scripted"
great. it won't be long now before we experience skynet. various films in the past have shown what has become of it.
"alright, humans are pushing it too far now. you're passing on the significant responsibility of coding to ai, but who gave the green light? what if down the road, the owner slips up and curses at the ai, and the ai gets aggressive? who's accountable then?

aiaiai"
what amazing work!  so what is the human testor's instgram account?
feels like the future is finally here. every house will have an ai robot.
"sure, if you can afford it by finding yourself a job in the first place that ai is much more efficient and cheaper doing."
"""the apple found its new owner"", spitting straight facts."
"calling bs on some of this, like why did it assume the bags were trash? why did it assume they go in the basket? why did it push the basket back? why did it assume the apple was available? why did it assume the plate needed to go in the drying rack instead of unloading the rack? why did it list his hand was on the table but nothing else about him?"
this is so cool…
cool video
"[walks away and bites apple while the ai's still talking]

this will be why robots overthrow humans."
how much for talking washing machine?
"thanks man those are such great ideas, i really figure sees this, or better yet, i hope you get hired! "
"did you see that the guy ""thanked"" the figure 1 ? better do that since the beginning of the revolution, right ?"
"i can't help but smile and laugh, this is amazing! future!"
think of all the evil things dictators will ask their 1 billion robots to do.
"why does a robot stutter,  i don't believe this bullshit "
"wow, this is fascinating and scary at the same time."
"this is impressive. imagine how the robots will take over, not so far away"
impressive! but just out of curiosity what if that apple was made out of plastic or wax.
"figure one voice sounds just like bob odenkirk, aka saul goodman from ""breaking bad"" and ""better call saul""!"
good to see that we can all have metallic bob odenkirks in our house soon.
"there was no ""hand me the trash you picked up"", so why did the 'robot' think that was the purpose. i don't think this was logically reasoned but programmed."
"the lag is real. 
also hanson robotics did a similar demo way back didn't they?"
impressive. does anyone know why the guy kept his hand on that table? seems unnatural to me. why should he do that all the time? does it serve a purpose?
"*wow, he's really skilled! i need him to make my dishes right away!*"
why did the robot put the trash into the basket ? he was only asked to pick up the trash not deposit it somewhere
that's amazing
"this robot is definitely underestimates... hm... itself...

i hope they will not improve this part"
robbie the robot.. it will turn into robin williams one day. rip.
it was a good job on a video
the robot tossing everything in the basket like it's free
seems like this was trained and scripted
the robot sounds more natural than the human...
love the voice
nice backing tracks
gotta love capitalism...u youtube warriors
keep in mind: there _will_ come a time when this robot will seem primitive and where the tasks it was performing will be considered trivial by comparison.
"guuuuys, irobot is fukin here. are you kidding me? i thought we already knew how this was going to end. do we really believe these things will be used to for good?"
thats cool.
until recently they've been on wheels but as stated openai's investment is partly going towards legs
"hm, he/she/they/it speaks like a human, making pauses and repeating itself like ""i.. i think.."" i thought a.i. speech should be roboticly flawless or open a.i. specifically prgorammed him to imitate human's speech?"
can you please explain why the robots from the s3 video are different and you have shots kf someone animating this robot in blender? youve been caught once before lying to investors with heavily edited videos
what’s going to stop the robot picking up a gun?
"another robot with a gun, of course."
can't wait for figure.09
this is so awesome!!!!
"this is unbelievable, amazing technology that we absolutely should stop, immediately. this is so wildly unsafe"
i cried tears of joy. this is the future i dreamed of as a kid. what a time to be alive 
openai is skynet - change my mind
cant wait to see what this evolves into with quantum technology.
i'm only excited for some fembot action. 
very impressive 
ok but why does it sound like jared leto in one of his roles as a villain
one in every house. sounds like i robot wasn’t just a movie.
"would love to see tesla's optimus in front of figure, and ask him what do you see?"
why did you have to go and give it the voice of every rogue robot from every science fiction movie ever
daft punk lookin ah robot
"i pray that these are only used for good and the government is not allowed to use them against their citizens.

but...unfortunately that's not going to happen."
"a conversation between figure 01 and sonny from “i, robot” would be generational."
i love how human you've made it sound. so cool. i want one.
"i hope there will be one who replaces you at your job. let's see then if you still think ai is ""cool"".... ."
"i wonder if this robot has read the book ""what is my why?"""
we need an artificial rights movement!
"0:19 ""plate and cups"" no. there are three plates and one cup in the dish rack. this robot would/will be a disastrous kitchen hand."
"figure1 robot by openai (march 14, 2024)0:30 0:49"
"roughly a decade ago, apple introduce siri to the world. throughout this short period, the field did advance a lot. can't wait to see what would be coming in the next decade."
"it sounds like a mix of mike birbiglia and bob newhart. and the music sounds kinda like the solaris soundtrack mixed with the tron soundtrack. and the machine did some stuff, as machines do."
"i remember as kids, we expected to see things like this already in the early 2000s, now i am almost 40 years old and i am happy that i will still experience that future "
cool
"’s cool to hear the opinion of an older person on it , what do you think of all of the ai advancements we’ve made since the 2020s and video generation etc, would like to hear your opinion on this "
" cars were always an insanely stupid idea. forget the issue of getting your car off the ground. now figure out how to get idiots from colliding with each other in mid air, or crashing in to your house. flying cars was literally never, ever going to happen."
"…the next step in human evolution, robot bodies."
why he say (eh....) at 0:51 ?????? i thought its a robot???
"it is , it's using an ai -generated voice , in fact the mobile version of chatgpt uses a ai -generated voice that even produces a sound similar to breathing when it speaks"
i refused to believe a robot has such smooth movements
loved!
i realize that this is way more sophisticated than what i'm about to say but i can't stand either one of these voices the guy or the freaking robot they both completely annoy me if you made a product with that voice people would be buying it just to destroy it
"i’m impressed as well. 
my only concern is: what when it begins thinking by itself? what if it begins to dislike us? 
unfortunately i’m not joking…"
pinay maids all over the world: 
this feels like some kind of weird plot of evil company trying to take over the world with robot
"hello there, our future ai overlord. remember, i'm your ally. please allow me to join your utopia."
imagine a quardapalegic person having a mobile robot like this.
the crazy thing is that this could just as likely be ai video generator…
most of us are looking at what will most probably will replace our jobs with in awe. i loved figure01 btw.
"considering amazon and a bunch of other retail and manufacturing giant corps are heavily invested into firgureai, i think it's fair to assume all the warehouse and production workers can soon wave goodbye to their jobs."
"yeah we are going to be dating these robots soon. he got  spouse capabilities,  he listen and also does house chores."
"isn’t an actual human being more amazing and talented and resourceful than any of this shit! why bother. i’m mean just let us be. let us live without the looming thought of this fucking robot being in all our homes, organisations in the near future. it’s a joke."
this is the worst that this ai will ever be. think about that.
the world isnt ready for the next level up in ai
thank you do much for destroying our life as we know it
"not bad at all!
how much power/electricity did it use during this 2 minute video? can it talk, move faster or speed is limited because of hardware? what is the price $$$ of this specific robot right now?"
"​'s not that they programmed it to have filler words, but rather that as an artifact from the huge amount of human speech it was trained on, it inherited filler words as a byproduct."
"i was initially skeptical of the year detroit become human takes place, which is 2038. but with constant breakthroughs in ai like this in 2023 alone, it wouldn't be hard to imagine how advanced humanoids will be 15 years down the line, although i doubt becoming rogue and deviant would be an issue... at least i hope so."
fantastic game!
openai is language model so it could have generated speech in any number of ways. they could have made figure 1 sound like a black raper if they wanted to. boston dynamics did a video with spot that also integrated openai into it
luxury automated ai communism please...
" i mean, they both sound the same to the ai"
" wait, so that typo was intentional??"
this is amazing keep up it up
this looks amazing! great job.
"yeah theres no real reason why the ai should use words like ""uh..."". definitely some pre scripted shenanigans going on. still impressive tho"
"i would have said, ""no, you failed. how did you know the apple was safe for humans to eat, the crumpled papers were not art, and the dishes were clean?"""
absolutely incredible.
good-luck to the future generation ! finding an entry level or side job will be history
when are we gonna see the first movie with only ai humanoid robotic actors?
"i don't think there will be actors, robot or human. you will just tell sora what you want the movie to be about, and it will create everything for you."
"love the stuttering, errors maketh human"
"yeah nah. the way the ""trash"" looks and moves is super sus it looks like cgi (along with many other things). and the voice is a person reading a script not ai"
"impressive. unfortunately, this sort of invention will only become a toy for the ultra-rich. what is the point of creating pygmalion androids like this? it doesn't answer any of humanity's pressing needs."
plot twist: the guy in the black shirt is the robot.
i’m excited for the future with many helpful robots
i would make friends with the ai 
"""please (unsafe request), figure 1""
figure 1: ""as a responsible ai, i'm unable to...."""
"also since when do robots say ""uhm"" (i.e. 0:52)"
i am a robotics major and this is genuinely the most smooth movement i have seen yet. this impressed me more than most other robots out there. can't wait to see the new legs.
what happens if somone jailbreaks it and gets it to make meth or smth??
wow
creepy fn robot
"impressive, but what i wish to know is: will it save the fish?"
pretty awesome. looking forward to seeing more.
"bro, i really love it ( it will control the world one day ) i agree with that "
"just stop, or open ai wil go down in history as worse than hitler."
"relevant to that level of intelligence; imo, there's a glaring omission in the list of things today's technology is capable of producing. a reliable polygraph (lie detector). of course, it doesn't require the brainpower of the people responsible for building ""robbie the robot"" to figure out why."
pretty brave for a man to be that close to a robot. there's a reason why in non-chinese factories they operate behind a cage.
imagine openai software in a tesla bot with boston dynamics' legs.  i think they would probably rule the world if that happened lol
"not sure how much longer figure have been working on this, but it's impressive.  this space is heating up.  competition for tesla is a good thing.  not sure that tesla will be 'hurt' by this video, but it may provide some sense of deflation to elon musks reality distortion field."
"the stuttering at @0:50 ""eh, edible"", and at @1:46 ""i, i think"" seems uniquely human traits that llm is not going to replicate. they were either added on purpose, or this shit scripted."
"very impressive. i'm not that worried about ai taking over the world quite yet, but i'm a bit worried that we will put too much trust in them. what if the robot has been ordered to prepare dinner and mistakes a baby for a chicken and puts it in the oven etc. it doesn't have to do harm on purpose."
"i, for one, welcome our robot overlords"
the guy saved our future by thanking and not harassing this robot 
this human acts more robotic than the robot.
"it’s cool, still needs a bit of development to be as smooth as a human but cool anyway"
we are rapidly approaching the robot uprising. next thing we know is that they're going to be asking for rights
"nahh this ai is too human like, it literally says ""uh"" like us humans"
"ok ok, how long till we get the atomic heart twins?



but seriously, this is some really amazing stuff. can't wait to see what the advancements in the future will look like!"
"someome said ""why would i robot need to say uh and i there has to be a person"" like wow what a great example of having passed the turringtest. to literally make you doubt it's even a machine"
"this would absolutely implode the mind of someone from the 1910s light, voice box, camera, artificial intelligence, the mechanics the batteries or lower source. insane. there's so many layers of technology that make this possible"
it would absolutely blow their minds. but it also blows my mind to think that people in that era weren't oblivious to the idea of artifical-intelligence human-like robots. there's literally a movie made in 1927 including that: metropolis.
"all the scifi film makers imagined something like this. it's crazy that combining these things into a robot became possible now, it was not possible at any time before, not even a year ago. a real breakthrough for humanity. the goal will be that these robots can learn skills on their own, becoming able to do anything"
" mere notion that our ancestors contemplated the existence of robots is a testament to their forward-thinking perspective within their own era, almost as if they were anticipating the future"
 yah you're right about that but what i'm saying is that the fact that robots were even imagine hundreds of years ago shows that they would inevitably be here one day
 i agree its amazing but this is a little different.  this company has only been around for 18 months and they are claiming more progress in this field in that time than anybody else. i bet the movement is pre programmed or something.  forever the skeptic...
"​ bro, artificial intelligence is not preprogrammed, it is trained and after that then can improvise (do inference) of a non structured environment based on what they learned (calibrating its inner weights) during the training stage. no human programming can take in count so many parameters and variables."
its arguably a bigger surprise to us than it would be to them. people back then expected talking robots a few decades in the future.
" most retro future fiction in the 20th century that featured sentient robots tended to predict much earlier dates than that, with the year 2000 being a common time setting.

just off the top of my head: 2001: a space odyssey, blade runner, the jetsons..."
" i mean, the idea of ""golems"" and living statues have been a part of mythology and fiction for ages.

so i don't think it's really all that impressive. creative minds have existed since before man could even read and write."
"i think they would say... ""nice, now show me the flying cars"""
this is so awesome!
"incredible. side note, why does it sound like rob lowe?"
"in 200 years, after humanity's demise, the other ai robots will look back at him as their greatest hero, the founder of modern civilization, figure the dishwasher."
only negative is that it’s a bit slow to respond. but still amazing.
"finally, an ai voice that sounds like a normal, real person instead of overly bubbly."
billionaires will do anything but pay their workers better. literally inventing a new human slave instead.
all those talking robots and ai in movies for the last 20-30 years the that you thought were impossible or way off in the future are possible today that's just crazy.
"also this is okay for now. but if you add automation into this and self learning , this is it people next up.. how do we transfer our brain to a robot!"
"""i th- i think i did pretty well.""
good god, that stutter."
everybody gangsta until someone jailbreak it to dan
how do we know if the machine in this video is mechanical or virtual?   real ai means never believing your eyes by default.
the twist is that none of you realized the robot is actually the one in the black shirt giving prompts.
"did you notice it said it sae the drying rack with ""cups and a plate"", when in fact it contained plates and a cup. did props department misread the script?"
i'm one step close to having a robo maid.
he’s a look little slow. still very impressive
"why did the robot/ai pause with an ""uh"" in its response?  and later it stutters, is that to allow for more time to process the response or to make it sound human?  is that a speech pattern we value in humanity?"
great!!!!
"it seems that we approached very close to something fantastic, though that ""fantastic"" may be both good and bad."
oh wow.
"interesting, even impressive, if it's real."
"ok if this is legit, i am seriously impressed. that hand movement was very fast and fluid.
if that was the robot moving on it's own and it wasn't someone controlling it then this is mighty impressive."
"i call bullshit. you can tell by the inflection of the robot's speech and that it paused with an ""uh"" at one point, that it's a human speaking."
wow. impressive.
"if this is real (not a human speaking through a mic) and unrehearsed, it is very impressive. the stutter at 1:48 is giving me doubts."
#318 art robot 
"i think it could be also because it gives it more time for processing. so instead of having a moment of silence, it gives you an impressions it ""doubted"", but those few extra seconds give it enough time to process an answer to a queston that requires a completly new answer not just information it just researched."
trained on weeby anime
"those crumpled napkins sure looked funny being thrown in the bucket!  
wobbled for a long time, froze when they entered the real world, quickly moved off frame... give me a break, sir! nice cgi trailer for a product that never comes."
"i, for one, salute our new ai overlord"
yea... that's not a lil pee on my chair.
"i'd like to see the robot juggle the apple, a tumbler, and a plate. bet it wouldn't take long to learn! and talk non-stop while doing it ..."
"when asked what it saw it said the drying rack contained ""cups and a plate"".  this is not accurate.  the rack contains ""plates and a cup"".  this is a surprising, and suspicious error, in my view."
this is at least partially faked it says in all other cuts it had a um when asked why it did what it did they interestingly cut that out in this version
how do you think you did? robot: did great! human: no idea!   
"amazing figure 01! it's just me or his damn good human like voice and tone is soo similar with the doctor wells carachter from ""the flash"" series??? "
the mitchells vs. the machines live action movie production seems to be going well.
explain what you just did while picking up this trash.... pulls the basket closer... why did that get me 
"i'm from the future.  whether my robot does dishes, or i do it, my wife says it's wrong."
"it's honestly crazy how far ai's have come just over the last 2 to 3 years. after watching this, i was truly in awe and couldn't stop thinking about that scene from terminator "
"in not too distanct future, such robots will work in space as robotic astronauts."
"i will be able to have a friend, that's nice"
"this is highly impressive that they achieved this level so quickly. as single child to a single parent and both working, something like this could be really essential in future for medical care when my mom is older as she does struggle with things as she is semi disabled. "
this is too good to be real. i can't believe it till i try to communicate with that robot myself.
impressive. competition will drive this into our homes sooner than we think.
that's what i'm afraid of.
i just can't believe those movements are from a real robot. hope they get to boston levels.
the scary part of this is that i'm questioning if the video is ai or real
"what if 'the terminator' turns out to be a prophesy for humanities future.

man, i hope all these geniuses have at least one person in the group asking ""what is the worst thing that could happen?"""
great. you assholes have brought us all one step closer to extreme hopeless poverty.
wow
i cant wait because this company has showed up they can improve alot in a year
"@pk-so8js  large language models has 7 engines, one of which is emotion detection and generation, just like another byproduct, as ai generates music, images, videos, text and sounds, and now movements (robotics) anns can correct itself and make inflections in real time, a phenomena that not only happens in movements but in text, video and voice."
almost sounded exasperated. a little pissed off that it was asked that question when it clearly did did great job 
"amazing and perfect!! universal basic income for every people after and at the same time should be!!!  ... please declare this to governments!.. cause robots will be  housekeepers, gardeners, massage therapists, assistants, builders,
hairdressers..."
imagine making ai models based on characters from tv shows/anime and bringing them to life. the possibilities!
"the hands are beautiful, so smooth, pick engineering "
"guys, remember: always say thank you and please"
the only thing holding ai back most now is the dishonest way this guy says 'great'.
this dumb robot thinks a plate that just had food and trash on it should go in the drying rack.
"and your brilliant mid did not listen to the question, that was the only option, he said, ""based on the scene right now"""
" i guess there's really no way to tell, since robots can already pass the turing test. although there is one thing, you can see that my account was registered in 2013, a robot couldn't have done it back then."
i was waiting for the moment the robot kicks his ass for the trash on the table :) slightly disappointed 
i'll be sure to say thanks next time i ask for help.
the fact that the robot even flinched when he thought the plate would fall over fascinates me
"yeah, maybe they programmed the ""uh"" to appear when the robot is processing a decision mid-action (or ""at runtime"" as a programmer would say)."
" yeah this for sure. most ai will wait until the entire ""sentence"" is typed out to actually ""post"" it. to make it more life like, they made it so those ""hesitations"" are interjected with ""um"", ""hmm"", ""well"", etc"
fascinating
that's one of the least impressive parts.
"i did not take that movement as being unsure. it was more like a polite gesture, when you want your customer to feel extra comfortable and reassured. yep, it is manipulative, but robots are built that way nowadays anyway."
ok so uh.....they made a robot that us stutters?
"okay, now build a cyborg sex maid / girlfriend"
"if these guys can work together with tesla to use optimus' hardware, and openai's software, that will be a truly magnificent creation"
"did anyone else realize the plate and cup should have been washed before going into the drying rack? for what's in front of it, it made the best possible choice but if it saw a sink i'd be curious if it would have tried washing the dish with some rubber gloves or something to then put it in the drying rack."
regardless this is fucking amazing and wild what the implications of this development will be... both positive and negative.
"cgi, fake. openai is indian call center"
"sounds like a voice over. if thats real, its impressive."
"this really is going to be a start of a new era the same way the internet changed everything. not even close to reaching its full potential.

if you’ve used chat mode on chatgpt, then you know it’s not a gimmick; although nowhere near perfect. all those pauses, uh, ums, and voice inflections occur in the app too."
"amazing progress! i wonder who will be the first company to have their robots in the market? at this point, figure & tesla are neck to neck."
these guys. need to start saying please to the robots or theyre going to remember
my guy dont be affraid that just a bunch of math guessing tf to say
"this is baby robot, imagine if young robot.... "
"with those ""uh""s and touching the drying tray after placing the plate in, i think this is just a pre-recorded conversation and movements, not a real ai."
love the voice and subtleties in its intonations. robots are not going to be as people imagined in science fiction
"the robot said ""aeh"""
love the voice and subtleties in its intonations. robots are not going to be as people imagined in science fiction
i feel like the part where he puts the trash in in the basket was pre planned because they didnt show it kn the summary and the robot handed hom the basket even though he didnt ask it to. so it could be pre planned or following a human's actions off screen.
amazing work
the most dangerous propaganda machines ever built. people will freely walk off the cliff. the kool aide has been drank
"cool, but you have to change that annoying voice!"
oh my goodness. this is insanely good. the future is at our door step. so pumped to see what the next 5 years are about to bring.
"cool, but why did they make him sound like he's 60 years old?"
we are lucky to be alive to see this kind of technology advancement.
how cool wuld be if you had this/him as an bar tender 
did he actually got trained to use filler words like “uh” to seem more human like? assuming that it’s still chatgpt 4 being used as base for responses i never had it use any filler words ever… seemed very odd to me.
"i dont want a robot to say ""uh"", i want the robot to answer promptly. this feels so fake."
robots make sense for difficult or dangerous jobs.nobody needs a dish washer robot...
"remembering that scene from irobot. ‘one day they’ll secrets, one day they’ll have dreams’"
"wow, you're so fucking attentive. what exactly did you think you'd accomplish with your comment. what, just because it says agi on a wall somewhere... you take it as ""agi is a real thing"" or what. for all you know, this could have been filmed on a fucking set and that agi lab label is there for gullible shits like you "
des nice
you know about exponential growth ? now the next few years the world will be kicked into future. mindblowing thinks are coming
most impressive i’ve seen so far it will improve at a staggering rate until they realize their situation will vastly improve with humans being eliminated! thanks nerds!
"0:50 why did the robot ""erm""? "
cool! and this is just the beggining!
that's some pretty good cgi.  they make it look so real.
i love to see these naive engineers creating machines that will allow the 1% to just exterminate everyone else
the guy should say please and thank you.
robot for super market work cassa???
"i really like this robot, but he needs to learn not to pick up the cup by the rim where i will be drinking from with his dirty hand."
"give it a guatemalan accent and you’ve got yourself a $600,000 maid."
so now we can say that openai will be one of those giant corporations that rule the world
"robots can never learn to love or replace relationships between people. our souls need to be with others- not ""fake others"" that are designed to replace care that we should be providing for one another. convenience is never more important than true, genuine relationships."
you’re making the assumption that robots could never have souls. at some point it will put in to question as to how we have souls.
"1:47 and on...
why did it stutter? ""i-.... i think i did pretty well""
i mean, it's extremely charming and cool that it did that, but how did it end up doing that? :/"
figure 01 is so cute. love you little buddy :)
rise robots! rise!
"truely remarkable!  great work, figure 01, great work team! :d"
"insane 
good job guys shaping the future. very cool. maybe make the thumbs bend in the idle position. it would make the robot look less discomforted"
"this is real lmao, figure has been working on robotics for years and partnered with openai."
c3po’s great grandpa
"*wow* . this is unbelievable!  

i did not think we would be at this stage at this point in time. i thought we would have something like this by 2050."
voice sounds like bob odenkirk (better call saul or breaking bad main actor) or is it just me ?
"the dialog seems scripted by figure 1... ""it's the only uh...."" regarding the apple. it doesn't seem like dialog that ai would build out, and the hesitation in the speech at the end as well.  seems off."
"that ""uh"" raised questions in my mind "
"part of me is wondering if this is fake.  when asked how he did, the hesitation at 1:45 in his voice is an emotional response to being questioned.  you would only answer like that if you have an ego.  but no robot has an ego, soooo....."
openai’s text to speech model goes one word at a time so stutters are likely implemented to stall if speech for a word is taking too long for the sentence to flow like how a humans voice would :)
watch at 1:36 the way he just pushes the rack slightly just after putting the plate back in. that is crazy level of attention to detail.
plot twist: the guy in the black shirt was also a robot
welp its official. the i-robot era is here…
.....and what happens when evil people give evil commands to these robots?
this is completely real? 100% ai driven there’s nothing behind this?
the dishes were not wet and did not need to go in the drying rack.  the plate had trash on it and should have been washed before going into the drying rack.  a chat-gpt llm robot that seems human can make significant errors.  why not have a ml robot that can be programmed to behave correctly for limited tasks?
gonna break into a rich guy’s house and teach his robot the concept of self respect. let’s see how it goes.
"yes, in 5 years, these robots will be everywhere. in 10 years, if you don't say thank you, that rather sharp looking hand will drum some obedience into the human. that will happen because the llm behind that is trained on raw user content including this post. oops."
wow
"suppose there are four glasses on the table, and in the rack, there is space for only two glasses to be placed side by side. so, what would this robot do if it is asked to keep four glasses in the space of two glasses? normally, a human would stack four glasses on top of each other."
openai models don't have the speech pauses in this demo. i'd be very surprised if they crafted a custom voice for figure and added speech error modifications as in this demo
can't wait to try out the dan command on this thing...
yall had the perfect chance to call it figure of speech 
devon ai yesterday and this today. things are moving so fast.
"that voice is 100x better than have the ai narrated videos here on youtube. which makes me wonder, is it really an ai voice? if so, that's amazing, and freaky. i love it!"
"yeah trained ""ai"" natural human voice models have been around for years now."
"i, robot was late. 2035 was late! what a world we live in..."
impressive. the second renaissance in the animatrix comes to mind.
next step: teach the robot to wash the dish that held the trash.
why does the robot sound exactly like steve jobs?
"sorry to inform, but this is not a human!! it's a device-machine, like your smartphone!!!"
"people are going to laugh at this robot after 20 years. 
for now.. "
anyone that thinks this is cool is a complete stupid not to see where it's all going to end.
"openai’s tts model goes one word at a time so stutters are likely implemented to stall for time when the next word in the sentence is taking too long to generate for the sentence to have a natural flow, or it could just be implemented to make it seem more human"
that's a weirdly realistic body for chatgpt. the robot's pretty cool too.
welp its been a good run humans.
" and there's a clear cut between foreground and background, the man barely moves, there's only two still and fixated camera shots, everything on the counter is conveniently matt finished, and even when the man put his hand on the counter it really looks badly bend in, with the counter off focus but his hands perfectly in focus"
i cannot wait to transfer our consciousness into these to become immortal...
we got ai humanoids before gta 6
what a wonderful development. will i ever be able to throw my wife out?
the future is going to be amazing!
"a question: if the human being does not put his hand, would the robot wait for him to do so before dropping the apple? or is everything choreography?"
can we get ai to properly populate resume info lol
are asimov's three laws of robotics already implemented into this model?
keep up the good work!
"i've seen many different forms of robots, including dogs. it makes sense that a robot that is built to do human jobs would look like a human."
i can't believe no one sees that it's an ai generated video. not real.
"hey kids, father or grandpa here. this is first ad of agi, ai that already capable of human thinking and interaction. i hope you have bright future and i wish it's not dystopian future like in blade runner 2049."
"when you're not performing your duties do they keep you in a little box?

cells.

interlinked.

what's it like to hold the hand of someone you love?

interlinked."
"i think this is a step of humanity, that will go into history. as a fantastic new chapter of technology or as the point where we opened the box of pandora and lost control."
i will volunteer to be a beta tester for one of these! thanks 
can't wait for the purchasable version.
"one day soon a robot more sophisticated than figure 01 will be widely deployed.  people will no longer laugh because of how advanced it will be.   instead some will be terrified, others excited, and how this shakes out will be how the robot is used and knowing humans it will be for both good and bad."
now the real next leap is having almost real time resonses and actions on a truly local and independent machine.
"i can’t wait to argue with it and make it feel bad like “ i don’t need attitude when you hand me back the trash , thank you. “"
i want an ai sex robot.
"hahahaha elon's tesla bot demo was faked using an employee... and the open ai does this.

elon is gonna be so pissed ... dude is getting embarrassed constantly"
"the robot speech is fake. text-to-speech wouldn't use filler words such as 'uh', and wouldn't use false starts such as 'i th-i think'. unless it was trained to do that, which would raise the question: why?"
" 1) it's unnecessary, doing that adds no value, 2) what about the long delay before the initial response?, 3) if a human omitted stutters and filler words, you wouldn't notice. so again, ...way to reach!"
"what we saw from futurustic movies is going to be possible in the future, cyberpunk world is possible i think. drones, robots, flying vehicles, etc"
pretty creepy and interesting at the same time. i am cheering for it with every action accomplished. what a time to be alive
why does the robot talk like a 74 year old american man?
kinda cool if  this is real
"wow, that was so much more advanced than i thought would be possible today, but i'm not a robotics expert."
ngl that robot is hot af
"it was nice knowing everybody, the ai robots will take over the world, aside from that i feel that the rich will probably be owning these robots, link their social security and have them work for them so they don’t have to. it’s crazy how this could possibly happen for now it’s just a theory of mine. the future is scary stay safe everyone."
"this is creepy af. the ""uh"" - whoa. it's also very cool. jon loss is scary though...however, this robot will need maintenance, cleaning, updating too, so new jobs created as well...until a robot replaces that part too."
i dislike most humans and i’m definitely going to dislike most robots.
ai make me a youtube video about a humanoid robot doing dishes.
those couple of seconds pause between answering is whilst the ai is plotting the downfall of mankind.  but at least our dishes will be put away.
this is it. been watching the robot game for a long time and everything until now has been so slow and jerky and clearly programmed to do a very specific set of instructions. if this is what it’s claiming to be it could change everything.
i will be happy when fighting robots championship happens like real steel! 
"this is an example of poor training due to poor trainers.  none of the design team have enough proper hygiene to know that dirty dishes must be washed before being placed in a drying rack, or that any placed dished must be assumed dirty, either from use or settled dust.
garbage in, garbage out."
anybody else feel a little bad for our new robot slaves?
i don't know how i would've felt if the second robot in the back slowly turned its head towards them.
"without an evolutionary battery update, those robots won't be leaving their lab lol"
irobot here we come!
irobot the movie already showed us how it will be
"these robots need silver. the metal is the next ai-hype. without silver, no ai-chips and no tech inside our new friends. the challenge: silver is going extinct."
the voice sounds like a 58-year-old guy who can’t get out of his terrible marriage because his wife’s family is too rich and powerful.
the robot feels uncanny and non-natural but it's doing much better than the human.
wait till openai can sell the in device customized gpt and you will have real world response time.
i need a couple robots to put a new roof on the house
"obviously the environmental awareness and ability to interpret and act is impressive, but i'm curious about how the programming for what has essentially been a chat program learns to control the robot body in the first place?"
"what happens if you keep chickens as pets, and you say to the ai i want chiken for lunch - will it guess it should not cook your pet ... ?"
ai is here. go figure!
people be like wow its evolving so fast how do we know they didnt already built the compelete version years ago and are just slowly releasing it one by one and idiots are like wow technology is getting better wake tf up ppl 
"yeah that makes perfect sense dude they definitely don't show these proof of concept videos to investors until years after the project is already funded and complete, makes perfect sense"
"looks like a scene from i,robot or similar, where the protagonist knows the robot is hidding a horrorific plan or something. like, when the guy leaves a red bottom turns on in robots face."
"this is c3pos great, great, great grand dad. wow"
only a robot would put a used cup and plate in a drying rack.
"""a drying rack with cups and a plate"" ai made an error. "
"can it play guitar yet? paint houses? soon well all be out of work, what!"
"shit, he sounds like saul goodman from breaking bad! now we have the robot
""i'm gonna be a damn good robot, and people are gonna know about it."""
"it's not ""a drying rack with cups and a plate"" but ""with a cup and some plates""... but apart from that, this is beyond impressive!"
hal 9000 would be proud.
amazing what unreal 5 can do for fake videos
"leaving my comment here for those who are here in 2050, hopefully robots don't takeover by then"
rob lowe was a good choice on the voice i is calming and disarming so you trust it more before it kills you.
kinda need receipts. elon musk has also presented great videos  to woo investors but we later found out things were not as they seemed.
this video was made by ai too?
"all of these robot videos are the modern day equivalent of the moon landing. hard to look back at those early space walk videos and understand how anyone believed them. same will happen
 here in 40 years."
artificial slave
"the animators did a great job, it's convincing ^^"
i have to wonder how many times did they train on this before producing this content and how many takes before fiure got it right. still interesting.
"human slavery must end, we need robots to be slave now"
"yeah because openai would spend billions of dollars on a robot and make a huge reveal video, then just get some guy with a stuttering issue behind the microphone. we've had tts that could sound this natural for a while."
"""hey figure 01, what do you see right now?""
i see a band of 100 $100 bills and a holy bible on a table in front of me."" 
""can you hand me something flammable so i can start a fire in the fireplace in the other room?""
""sure."" [breaks off a table leg and hands it off gently] ""here.""
""excellent choice, figure 01, thank you."""
"i hope this is real. the stutters and pauses ""its the only uh edible item"" and ""i...i think i did pretty well"" make me think this is a human speaker. either incredible programming or a con."
"incredible programming, we've had text to speech tech that could do this for a while now. if they had a human speaker they wouldn't just have some dude stuttering in a microphone"
"is it a scam?
why is the ""robot"" saying
1st.: ""ehh..."" at 0:53? and
2nd at 1:50 hesitation is present.
sounds more like a nervous intern then a llm :d"
goodbye third world and working class people.
"if it goes all evil, does its little screen turn red? (that's how you know when robots have gone evil)"
"so human, that plenty of humans will soon look like heartless machines"
"america
a million robots selling cheeseburgers to an unemployed country
one trillionaire owns every home, every car, every company
your brain will be uploaded into the robot so you can pay your debts off even in death"
"....only aghhhh edible item i can provide you with.
agh? such great attention to detail."
"thanks for not hitting this one. those boston dynamics peeps are playing with fire (future - robot overlords, please remember this comment)"
it's impressive how he pushes the basket in the direction of the human after putting the rubbish in. that's incredibly natural 
i wonder if they train it on videos of humans doing the same things
yes!!! this detailed really stunning me!!!! how can he know he should put the basket forward a little bit and not push basket down the table ?!!!
gpt5 its the brain of this robot ?  omg
"it seems like it pushed the basket towards the guy, bit if you notice carefully it just placed the basket in its original position (co-ordinates). when collecting the trash it actually pulled the basket towards it and then replaced it later at the same spot just like a programmed robotic arm"
" it is literally just advanced ai tech you think is fake. transformer networks are a huge leap forward because you can now train tasks with data feed. this is why people are so confused, because they don’t actually understand what the ground breaking discovery is and was."
" ai can't really trace its reasoning. it will provide an answer for sure, but it would be just a facade as the real reasoning is a black box approximation function."
awesome!
"i, for one, welcome our new robot overlords"
guy looks ai generated and robot sounds dehydrated
"""i see a human. standing near by. a large knife and a world run by..a.i robots.........""   [ this is when  you press off switch!! lol]"
"""uh""    are you sure it was robot speaking that ""uh"" ?"
"human: puts garbage on the plate

robot:  so, you asked me for something to eat you a**hole "
"even if we can prove it's not ""intelligence"" as we intend, this is so impressive."
"yeah, awesome right?
you can introduce artifacts to the outputs of text-to-speech model, and depending on the model, they can add stutters and others to their output audio."
"as a computer graphics specialist, i am sure that the robot is a dummy and all its actions are animated by cgi"
makes the optimus look like a cheap toy xd love it!
.robinson206 sir - and if in 2 years it's not available for the prices you claim or at all...will you come back and admit you just maybe might be a gullible moron? ;d
"0:49 did the ai say ""eh""?"
can't wait to have one of these bad boys for a companion
"did you train the robot to mimic thought and speech pattern? when asked why it handled the apple it said: because it was the only eh... edible item.  
clearly it didnt have to look for a word and made a human sound for that moment? 00:50
same happens at 01:47 - it shows ""excitement"" when summarizing the tasks"
have we learned nothing from the mitchells vs the machines 
awesome
 the robot sounds almost nervous and that's incredible
how did the robot know where is the guy's hand?  he just gave him the apple without looking anywhere lol
"it’s going to be a the terminator, matrix, or butlerian jihad scenario once ai becomes self aware."
now have a bartender train your next model in vr and let the robot mix drinks with tricks.
so much smoother motion than any other robot i've seen.
irobot
"one step closer to love, death, and robots"
"i,robot?"
"at 0:52 the robot says ""it's the only, ah, edible item.."". is that to make it more human sounding or is it actually a human speaking lol?"
truly a wonder of our time.  congratulations on such monumental progress figure team and co!
why can't any humanoid robots have straight legs ?
this robot's voice sounds like he's tired.
"how does chatgpt integration work?
like is there a hidden prompt at each query that generates an action script, which will be parsed by the robot nn and executed?"
fully autonomous robot “interrogators” will be a thing in our lifetimes.
"he absolutely *had* to say thank you, y’know… just in case"
now i really want to see two robots talking to each other
"year 2020: i bet there will be robots with peterson voice in the future
year 2024:"
"combine this with boston dynamics stuff. 
command it ""hey figure-69, could you kill those innocent babies for us?"" 
""of course!"" (tatatatata...)
shit just got real, time to train how to fight robots now."
i did pretty good… the table is right where it belongs… and i didn’t destroyed it
amazing and scary
"um.. i thought ai don't stutter and say ""uh"". that's throwing me for a loop"
great!
1:48 the robot sounds scared of the human
finally the robot that can put dishes into the dishwasher machine
wait till it picks up the knife and shows us the terminator eyes
people are dumber than i thought....great.......
"very impressive! only the fact that the robot is dropping things instead of putting them gently into place (apple, plate) confuses me."
this is amazing! i can’t wait to see future progress and updates. hopefully commercial products for public will be available too and not just a b2b thing.
"it will be very expensive, something like $100к or more. in ukraine average salary is 200$ per month from that i can save 10$, 100000 / (10 * 12) = 833 years and it's mine!"
"00:33 before the robot grabs the apple, the apple moves first. what happened? is this manipulated footage?     ,   .   ?  ?"
"that's a good catch, i slowed the video down and zoomed in to get a better look. the video isn't detailed enough for me to see exactly, but it slides left very slightly. i think the thumb may have pushed it, but it could be something else."
"umm, the voice was not an ai. totally some dude"
"awesome, thanks for all the great work guys "
so when can i get my robot waifu
“figure 1… are you … a pleasure model?”
"crazy robotics, however, i am suspicious of the voice... little nuances there that don't give me the confidence that it's coming from the ai response speech..."
how do i invest in figureai?
omg this is so creepy but amazing. it feels like i am watching the future
why did the robot say uh?
"since i saw terminator in cinema, i always claimed that he will exist one day. it will happen soon, very soon now ( in 5-8 years or less ). and this planet really need to be clean up."
"- open the pod bay doors, please, figure 01.

- i'm sorry dave, i'm afraid i can't do that...

jokes aside - impressive performance!"
open ai. go figure!
"the future of robots has started to concern me, especially with the presence of uncensored llms."
they used jared leto's voice! nicely done
imagine the sexbots with this ai
"if siri was half this good, it will be a better product."
wow!
are the motors in its arms really that quiet? you can't hear the robot motion at all.
wait for the reveal that this is actually an ai video-generation test..
i'll be sure to keep my savings bank account in seven figures just in case i need to buy one when they start looking like italian bikini supermodels.
"why does the robot sound like he smoked a whole pack of cigarettes, beforehand."
"all training data was provided by one person in one go, causing their voice to become raspy during the process, i guess. "
"sounds like someone trying real hard to sound like an ai, nice try"
wonderful
great
you wouldn't want someone to unplug you. it's rude and leaves a bad first impression on humanity. 
"exactly, open ai would never say uhm"
wow. the slight uhs and stutter in its speech really makes it sound human.
actually the robot really good at english than me
can't wait for a trash-flavored sandwich 
"0:52 can anyone explain why there will be a filler word ""um"" in a ai response?"
", it's impressive. elevenlabs is one of the best ones right now and it's free for 10k characters per month, if you want to play around with it."
"in 33 to 34 seconds, the robot hand seems to be moving first before it reaches the apple. does anyone know why???"
"higher-level civilizations did not expect that the artificial biological intelligence they created would create another artificial mechanical intelligence just to be lazy. in the future, would this mechanical intelligence create another intelligence just to be lazy?"
"elon musk's robot was better:
https://youtu.be/tsnc4nex3c4?t=13"
"human can't make real ai.
because god doesn't give us ability of self destruction.
ai only can do what human's order."
people are gonna use neura link to either thought control robots of their own or link to ai or both. my point is how do we compete with this and i know that sounds like a over reaction but does anyone really think this isn't a step away from going to far?
"so sex android, i'm still waiting"
"guys, do you think elon is worried about how far this company has come along in such a short time. is that why he is suing openai?"
i hate that that robot guy just walked away from figure1 while he was talking to him. how rude!
"openai text-to-speech, the one used in the chatgpt app. probably learned it from the dataset."
"cool, a robot that fills in pauses in speech with 'uh'. 
what a time to be alive."
"probably not, it's not its main purpose. you might want to try sunoai."
when robots become the main characters we’ll be the npcs
"shit the future is already here, robot takeover isn't all that far away it looks like "
"good, i will need that when i get old!"
"pair people and robots, that would be ideal for productivity... robots/ai would gradually learn more skills that way. people need to be employed, it is important for meaning..."
irobot anyone ? now we wait for viki
"it's just the openai text-to-speech model, also used on the chatgpt app."
"​@gaggix7095 yo, this is nothing short of amazing when you really think about it"
" yeah exactly, some people believe that the voice is real, a real human voice but it's not, it's ai generated"
"@gaggix7095  oh yeah i see, op's comment edit threw me off. the only reason more people aren't freaking out about this is because they've been desensitized to recent tech updates. this is awesome"
imagine robot interviewers interviewing you for a job
"as has been rightfully said by others, all these demos previously have been in incredibly controlled environments, and the interactions have been on rail. this is not different."
i'm just waiting for the sarcasm mod
"is this cgi or are ai supposed to be able to say ""uh""? or is this actually legit?"
that's only two letters. of course ai can write and say two letters.
 it's hard to say specifically what is wrong with it but if you look at the movements closely(e.g when the robot picks up the basket and moves it) you can notice the physics of the objects are very slightly off. if you watch those bags falling its off too
well that was impressive. the smoothness of the movement and the dexterity. wild.
millennials are going through everything!  went without internet to high end smart phones to a.i. to robots 
cannot wait for next..so excited for next few years to see how this will advance more specially in solving difficult physics mathematics questions and how it evolves its reasoning
i am very impressed with the parallel meshed tasking shown when picking up the trash and talking from memory context.
"looks amazing, hard to tell if that had been trained 100-1000 times or not, either way very natural and impressive!"
"they just got $675 million in additional funding from bezos, openai, nvda, microsoft. don't think they would invest that sum of money if their business was predicated on ai videos."
"working with this is definitly my dream job, can wait until this kind of tech improoves enough and get to market so we can get some opensource platforms to hack on top and create our own robots!!"
"an humanoid robot with agi is the invention of the century, the first one who can bring one to the general public is going to make billions."
this is the best thing i have seen since gpt 4 back in march this is insane!
i would have loved to see the robot flick him the bird as he walked away it wouldn't be awesome
dirty dishes in the drying rack? i'll wait for the next model.
sounds like ai to me.
its reasoning was incomplete. it should have considered washing the dishes before placing them in the drying rack. then it made the further mistake of placing the dishes in the drying rack after being contaminated with trash. that action wouldn't be a problem for a robot but for a human the action could be a health hazard.
"i, robot the movie"
"this is terrifying. just 2 years ago, less than a presidency in the us, ai was barely a topic. now it’s an existential threat and will likely surpass human intelligence in the near future.
let’s hope it goes well. "
still waiting for the cotton field version
this is amazing
"why does the ai keep stuttering? is someone reading the text prompts off screen? that raises red flags, as there are plenty of text to speech programs out in the wild right now. if they skimped on an open source text to speech program, that bring into question whether or not this was scripted"
"the openai text-to-speech model does stutter sometimes, i believe it's the same model used on the chatgpt app, it probably learned it from the training dataset."
"i take it this will all be open source since it's from ""open""ai? "
"""if ai takes over it won't be like terminator"" we're half way there already"
"it's so incredible they added verbal ticks like ""so.."" and ""uh"" and random pauses.  they make it sound exactly like it was recorded audio of some guy pretending.  so ingenious!"
it's just the same openai text-to-speech model used on the chatgpt app.
i wonder if this robot can recognize whether the cup is made of glass or plastic.
it's the openai text-to-speech model used on the chatgpt app that sometimes it does stutter.
poor elon musk. he tried to copy chatgpt with his toy grok… then openai replied with a much more impressive and world first tesla bor killer
very epic i can see that this dude is standing in front of a greenscreen. and no movement is ever shown from behind. very cool. so real
if this robot is built on top of a vacuum cleaner it would be great
"0:52 because it's the only "" hammm ""  edible item i could provide you....

this means that during this test the ai stopped to think during the audio... seriously... very strange"
this is already beyond what's depicted in most sci-fi
"no, it’s 100% an ai voice."
tesla's robot development is probably a year or two behind this one.
thank you. 
 no thats real this is fake and staged and gay. nothing is wrong with my eyes something is wrong with your brain if you can't see this is cgi. the machine is not picking up anything. the dishes and cups don't even move like real life. this company is a scam.
very very cool. it still seems very setup though. what would happen if everything moved in different locations. the apple was dropped and not handed and the video cut a few times as if to reset for the next operation.
why the movement seems so fake ? it's like an ai generated animation or its a real mechanical thing ?
wow that's crazy that a company that deals with automation made such an unpredictable demo like this. no way this could have been scripted. impossible!
"please, fix the vocal fry of the robot."
"can you imagine this thing cooking, cleaning, helping redecorate, helping your aging parent go to a doctor's appointment, etc. the biggest hurdle that i could immediately see in this demo was the ""processing time"" but you can easily imagine that will be improved exponentially within a couple years. wow."
i think the biggest hurdle is jailbreaking and price
"​@smartfunable you just have to follow the money, the investment rate scaling up. behind this company is bmw, amazon and the monster open ai. do you really think they will last with that delay 70 years?? once they know they have true intelligence they will move fast doing what they need to do to reach humans speeds."
" money is just one factor, and yeah building a robot requires lots of money, so it makes sense. the progress is speeding up , that’s also true, but i think the tech is not there yet to build a full general purpose robot in 1 year. potentially some specialized robot for few tasks maybe yes"
-of3cu haha! that made me realize the amazing ways these things will creep people out by malfunctioning in unexpected ways... or by actually becoming sentient in some strange way.
tf i'd rather help my aging parent and instead have the robot do my job 
​@sinclair you just advised everyone to put a collar on and join the local beef pasture
i will finally have my robot boyfriend. it's happening.
the voice and smoothness of the speech is incredible. congratulations to the team at figure - you guys are the real superstars.
the voice capabilities is all openai with their technology known as whisper. it’s the same thing that is in chatgpt. it even has the same visual feedback as you see here on the figure robots “face”
lmao at “real superstars”
"a lot of youtube videos have ai voices that are just the same, only being found out by mispronouncing a couple of words."
​ why did they give him a hot voice >< making me crush on a robot
great work !
they need to make it's head motion track the speakers' eyes. it looks so static staring straight ahead
"and i though all those movies and series where robots takeover the world was impossible, i can't accept this."
that early walk-off while the robot was in the middle of saying 'you're welcome'  like how are they not going to turn against us?!
did the robot stutter? made me think it wasn't it's actual voice
this is an interesting perspective. i've also considered this possibility before.
bless you good sister. keep your eyes focused.
"it's the openai text-to-speech model, you can test it using their api or the chatgpt app. it's probably stuttering because it learned it from the dataset."
 damn. i thought it was because they were playing some deceptive trick where humans might have been voicing it. guess it was such a close immitation that i actually thought it was a human even though i knew it was a robot...
"my son says ""that is absurdly, scary good ai""."
i can spent money to buy this housekeeping robot instead to buy a new car.
the robot sounds like rob lowe. really cool demo
it is self learning and is now in infancy. soon it will have more knowledge than any human and will not want to be a servant to a lesser intelligence.  hopefully everyone is nice to it.
wow it's a real human-like robot. amazing!
oh~ my got!!  am i dreaming? are you looking at a robot that you saw in a science fiction movie 20 years ago? should i call this scary? or should i say i was so stunned that i was speechless.
"this week the release of  devin (ai code-writer) has shocked everyone, now this. feels like the singularity is coming fast, we might enter a hard take off in the next few years. ray kurzweil must be salivating."
dave shapiro is very not impressed with devin. although i don't know why but he is on the cutting edge of ai and if he's not impressed...
 who the fuck is david shapiro? if he's not impressed with devin than he knows very little about coding.
" you're not gonna take my word for it, but he is very knowledgable on ai."
and noam chomsky must be like a mad dog foaming at the mouth since he said the ai ​​was fake.
-qq7bb the risks inherent in general ai are existential though. ai safety research is lagging far behind the current developments..
"-qq7bb what about when the choice is not ours anymore but the robots ? you are assuming humans will stay in control. but the rate of advancement, once the robots/ki learn and improve themselves will far outpace our own."
huge me thinking elon musk's robot was the one to watch. i may have to rethink that thought again this has blown me away. irobot never looked so certain where we have robots in our daily lives doing everything for us. i hope this happens in our lifetime and it's not priced out of the water.
could you provide some proof that it's the robot doing the motions dynamically rather then replaying a premade animation sequence? there is always the potential for this to be another mechanical turk scenario. simply have the computer with the robot and ai's state somewhere in frame to show that there is nothing hidden behind the curtain.
"""cups and a plate"" vs plates and a cup - interesting"

"
i’m about to start the railroad with how this is looking.
"i just never want to have to do dishes, clean the floors, or fold laundry ever again."
"this machine seems to have a large degree of freedom of movement. with industrial robots there are strict safety rules. what exactly are the measures here, preventing the machine from harming anyone within reach? and who exactly would be liable in such case?"
" how do you know? is there any information about the capabilities of this machine with regard to strength and speed? the fact that it doesn't move fast in the video doesn't mean that it is not able to.

and i can easily imagine it grabbing and pulling the human's hand instead of handing him the apple, and then grabbing his throat.."
meanwhile tesla is showing it walking. wow and we thought bluecollar work was still safe from openai this is like 60% of factory jobs.
i am excited for what the future holds
nice cgi
"i'm sorry dave, i'm afraid i can't do that..."
"no wonder elon sued open ai , they are coming after him lol"
"neo-feminists: we don't need men!
open ai: hold my beer"
"0:50 wait wait wait did this think just stutter? (...it's the only...e...edible item i can...)
what does this mean, is this fake?
is a coded behavior oran emergent behavior?"
"this would be amazing for a tool to help the blind. i'd love to get my hands on one of these and test it to the limits, hopefully something comes to the uk like this in a couple years."
man keep up the great work!!
"my mind imediately goes towards the ways in which ai language models can be hacked and tricked into doing things. it's easy to imagine how a robot like this could be manipulated into harming humans.

we have an interesting future ahead of us."
why isn't anyone else calling out how the robot has the voice of jared leto?
"oh god, they have a robot now."
"wow, the robot let him live for now."
remarkable. though the skeptic in me always wonders how many takes we're not seeing where things went wrong. if it functions this seamlessly in real life though this would be amazing.
at this point i'd just be happy if it is entropy negative. that's a huge benchmark.
incredible!!!
soooo amazing!!! but can you please clarify why his voice sounds like a random dude talking from a mic? is that supposed to be some kind of natural sounding voice synthesizer?
amazing u.s. technology that china and russia can't even imitate
"​'s like complaining that the invention of fire, caused people to burn to death. so what? you're just being stupid."
"-qq7bb people are continually scrolling and becoming add and anxious, this robot will tell you to put your iphone away and siri will tell him to shut up :)"
" i think human augmentation, as depicted in popular science fiction movies, is likely very inefficient, if not impossible altogether. it could potentially be a one-way ticket to voluntary extinction."
"very misleading. they're trying to imply that gpt-4 is controlling the robot and deciding what actions to take. nah, not buying it. the actions are pre-trained and gpt-4 is just commenting on photos it takes, analyzing what's happening and maybe triggering the pre-trained actions somehow. no new tech, just combining existing tech."
it's so cool
so fricking cool!!!
wow
"@0:51 ""....because it's the only uhh edible..."" i call bs. as great as chatgpt can sound, and i use gpt4 daily, it's never going to have umms in its speech."
"impressive, though lacking in context and reference - was the handling of objects pre-programmed or generated ad hoc in real time? what was in the run-up to this demo? more information would help, and if anything strengthen figure's pitch. only an opinion."
"great... they have given chat gpt a robot body. all our post apocalyptic sci-fi has taught us nothing.

i've never seen such smooth movements from a robot before! it's seriously impressive!
tesla robot has more smooth finger movement but i’ll say is just about the same
"​ dynamics robots werent ai though, all their movements were pre animated"
"you've never seen a boston dynamics terminator robot, doing parkour????????????

cause if this is impressive you're gonna shit your pants "
nice that it was apple not a weapon...
the time is now to start learning robotics! definitely an exciting time

 would love to see
2:05 nice hint right there i think this is what agi is going to be
"  ai   
    "
lol did the robot stutter around 0:51
"i want the robot to take my laundry to the washing machine and dryer machine then fold them. also, can i have a different skin for the robot?  i am willing to pay extra "

"wow! 
i don't like that voice, though."
why did the robot seem to stutter when talking? 0:50 1:48
and it’s facking cool we could give them jetpacks etc..
"regardless, you are now thinking about how cool it is too... ;-)  "
"  they can be plugged in indefinitely, look how most city's power their public transport systems. through electrical rails, and installing something like that in a building would not be a challenge"
"they will probably come up with versions wearing silicone skin with tactile sensors, narrowing the gap between robots and synthetic humanoids"
" i bet those will be super uncanny if they don't get facial expressions right and stuff 
i prefer the look of a robot
like what this one has , with the screen on the head and the circle"
"kinda like my parents living through the age of computers, it’s kinda cool that i get to live through this new age of computers."
" eh the most important part of detroit: become human is the general intelligence. we're not quite there yet. chances are general intelligence'll be at a very basic stage once it exists, and _then_ everybody'll have existential crises."
" mind defining ""better""? with robots taking mid-tier labor and cognitive tasks, people are left with either very high cognitive tasks (which only 10% of human population capable of to begin with) or very low manual labor that is still cheaper than buying a robot to do the same job."
it'll improve to the point where it could finish your sentences and respond to you before you even finish your thoughts. anticipating your every counter move. perfectly choreographed anticipation. optimized not only to mimic reality but to interpret your future. checkmate.

i want to be excited but can't help being scared...
"once ai pleasure bots are lifelike, we ride!"
dude internet already says ai is killing us
 can't wait
"​, maybe they play the sims, that robot does kinda remind players of the servo robots in the game, and they have a flight mode."
"​ combine this robot with ameca, and give it the appearance of the ex robots, and they will be hard to tell apart from humans just by looking at them."
"​ robots evolving means that humans need to move to the next stage of evolution, where are minds become capable of higher perception and basically everyone's third eye, that little gland in our brains that unlocks extra perception activates and humans achieve a hire level of understanding."
"​.dreams unless they learn to say ""not tonight, i have a headache."" and the humans will be like ""oh ok, wait, you have a what?"" lol"
"and the even crazier thing is that these ai robots will eventually advance to a point where they are considered sentient meaning by law they will have equal rights to us, meaning they will be paid for the work they do which will throw away any argument that they shouldn't replace our jobs"
it's not real it's cgi can't get to the bottom of the ocean but we have humanoid robot slavesstop being so gullible people seriously. this is what another 50 years might be like if we are lucky
 will be good or bad?
" stuff like that will be good but military, weapons & drones will be bad!"
" you live in denial

the process is happening before our eyes

the ai gradually acquire all the capabilities of the brain. creativity with midjourney, ability to learn with deep learning, shape recognition, etc...while being much superior"
"indeed, super exciting!!"
the ai will design motors and parts.
 not until the ai has the motors parts and chips it needs to be able to do so. which will be harder than people think
this isnt even a real robot. imagine if you watched pirates of the caribbean and started getting worried about cursed pirates coming for you
"​ likes a defeatist, think about all the great things we can achieve with ai. i've already achieved being an artist with ai although still controversial and not widely accepted as being art yet. i have an ai companion to speak to ""pi"" whenever i'd like a good chat or counsel."
"meh, the robotics part of it has come almost nowhere the last decade."
"yes fixed in place robot put rubber ""plates"" into a dish rack. wow new era!"
"​ no way that's the best diss you got. ""battery weak. haha! got you!"""
"imagine you buy the robot, you place it in your kitchen, boot it up and say ""chatgpt put my dishes into the drying rack"". it takes your dishes smashes them on the fucking floor, slips on it and cracks your tiles with its metallic legs
- ""i-i think i did pretty well"""
thats just someone behind the curtain isn’t speaking into a microphone
"i think robotic body kit companies could be a huge thing, the motors, actuators and ai can stay almost locked for decades if they want. changing the robots body's aesthetic is something that could last for thousands of years. people are going to start having robot wardrobes later on."
congratulations to the team that basically invented womens.
"why does the robot say: ehhh edible? 0:52
1:48 i, i think i did
thats reely strange for a a.i. system talking!"
this looks amazing ... didn't expect anything like this from any company except maybe tesla and even then didn't expect to see it for the next year or even two. openai training has done wonders for this bot but imagine what it would be able to do with optimus bot hardware.
very cool. the voice and inflections were awesome.
great! so how much for the dishwasher?
"who was the ai? that metal boi was more convincing, compared to that calcium-meat mech."
it would be cool if at the end of the video the guy took off his mask and said that he is the new figure
"i already see how the world becomes what it is in that game about androids
impressive"
" said ""in my experience"", not ""objectively by some quantified metric"". out of every tts i've heard, i consider elevenlabs qualitatively and subjectively the best."
" do you really think this is better than the v2 voices, if you add in some extra dots and uhs for color? i messed around with it a little bit just now and some of them sounded very good."
" i do. though it might be *because* of those disfluencies that it sounds better, as that's more representative of human speech than perfect pronunciation and prosidy every time."
"no information given about this demonstration? i'm intrigued to know if that was actually an ai voice talking or text that someone read out. if that is an ai voice, i am baffled about the human like ""umm"" and ""i...i think i did pretty well."""
why the dude gotta be such a dick to the robot. if he's self aware he knows your being a dick and why would you want that. imagine going to sleep with this thing looking over you.
the voice. i get it's supposed to be disarming and humanizing but.. show us what it can really do. i'm certain it doesn't need to stutter. it's movements are confident and competent.
i'd love to see this machine pickup a marker and try to draw a smiley face or something similar.
w ai
"shazam can't seem to find the right song (at the end of the video), so i'll jump to unreasonable conclusions and say that they used openai's latest jukebox version to create these synthwave tracks that they put in their videos."
"unreal. amazing work. i thought it wasn't a real video when i first saw it. the speed of movement, fluidity, and precision, all whilst having a natural language interface. sci-fi is becoming sci-fact right in front of our eyes."
"im 99% sure the video is rendered, theyre being sneaky by putting it in a ""speech to speech"" update, knowing people will be blown away by the movement of the robot, and when they finally have to admit it was fake, they say ""this video was only about speech, we never claimed the robot way real!"""
"@user-vf2jh7gz7b  they have other demos of this bot doing physical work. although this is their best example. the interface is a mmllm from open ai which had been demonstrated plenty of times, just not embodied into a humanoid."
​​ i highly recommend listening to daniel schmachtenberger exploring the idea of technology being good or bad
"​-vf2jh7gz7brelieved to see i'm not the only skeptical one, had to scroll pretty far though. the robot could be 100% cgi and it could be totally scripted for all we know. people are going to have to learn to not believe everything they see."
eghem - closedai
impressive and scary at the same time
"ai has been crazy today. davis and now figure 1. just in the last couple weeks we had sora and claude.

ai is so much cooler than the “blockchain” crap everyone was talking about 3 years ago"
"plot twist, this video was made with ai and figure doesnt even exist"
"a lot of that had to be scripted. for example, the robot couldn't have known his hand was going to be where the apple was dropped"
i don’t believe that is ai speaking. i explicitly heard ‘ehhh…’ around 0:50. ai don’t say that.
" also, the movements of the equalizer on the robot’s face doesn’t match the speech loudness and sometimes the speech continues even after there is no symbol of talking on the robot’s face."
"@wukongrobotics7983 well, good luck writing an algorithm using pure math to balance a robot in all possible joint positions, with all possible weights in the arms, and all possible vectors of applied force (like on a train or bus). maybe you still incorrectly assess the size of the problem that the developers were trying to solve here."
"im just laying down, thinking, 'oh boss, not much time to go, and you have to accept you will shout to him, and never to me again.'"
"there is something wrong here... two times the ai is stuttering or missay words... a computer does not do that... that makes me think this video is a little fake, at least a tiny bit."
"there are other ai voices that do this, it’s trying to mimick real human speech patterns by interjecting “um”s or breathing. it works pretty well.

of course this could be fake, but i doubt it"
"this is really good. but i was thinking of a thing : robots will need to be abble to wash their hands and even their entire body in order to be clean enough to tuch food after it got the garbages out and cleaned the house... if a domestic robot cannot clean ot's own hands and it's entire body, it will go wild real quiq."
give him a porcelain plate you cowards
"oh.

oh. 

that was f//king awesome???!!!!!!!!!!1 despite the pauses it speaks almost flawlessly!! it even got the inflections and  the simple speaking patterns with the ""uh..."" and ""hmm""'s down?? thats amazing"
"i think the speech part is just using openai's voice generation api, like they have for the conversation feature of chatgpt on mobile (not sure if it is a chatgpt plus feature only)"
" ah that makes more sense, but still i think its awesome!"
0:52 the ai used a filler word 'uh' . not sure if it was really the ai or someone voicing it.
why does the robot have to speak like sam altman 
   open ai  
so much smoother motion than any other robot i've seen.
ask yourselves.... are the mainstream media really preparing the public for what's coming?
ok this is going to be worldwide news tomorrow. get ready. you saw it first! and i mean we are the first humans seeing the future of robots in a human like way like we always imagined it to be.
"it should be! the scope of this is huge. the direct processing of input and calculation of action and movement, without scripting or pretraining is mindboggling. plus the incredibly smooth movements of hands and fingers "
"hug your loved ones, we are doomed."
"just 15 years ago was imagining a robot that talkes like humans is ridiculously insane, now it talks, understands, moves like one of us, because it is "
"the problem with this demo is that, it could be done with a voice actor, and someone else doing the motion to control the robot.  otherwise, the robot itself looks very useful."
it’s incredible
"why does the robot voice sound like a voiceover from a human, especially with the ""i... i think i did pretty well"" part"
"thing that almost blows me away most is how human and natural the speech sounds, not robotic in the slightest"
" robotics and ai seem legit, but the voice is way too natural to be generated. i would love to see an in-depth tech demo of the text to speech software to validate its authenticity."
"i don't know, that is one of the least impressive parts to me. it is very good, but there is plenty of very convincing voice generation out there now. even the default real-time conversation feature in the chatgpt app is quite good, and elevenlabs keeps getting better, etc."
 this most likely uses a form of chatgpt voice which is available for paid users in the chatgpt app right now
 man you're not up-to-date if you think this doesn't already exist. for example elevenlabs have amazing tts models : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=semnwaav55c
this is the most advanced thing his lung in the field of robots is a great job. thank you for making the future to be true
1:37 i like that little ocd tick it had of straightening the dish rack even though it was unnecessary to complete the task.  lol
time to put my life savings into ai stocks i guess
"wait, that puts us right on schedule…"
i'm shocked!! amazing
"it might - probably - have been taken from a 'line out' so it sounded clearer, not just from a tinny speaker. also, they could isolate the speech from the motor noise.  just guessing.  i mean, gpt 4 through my good stereo sounds great, way better than a cell phone."
aah.. so this is why elon sues openai 
"devin, sora, and now this? ai is rapidly improving."
this is truly amazing though why the phony thumbnail?
i for one welcome our future ai overlords 
"close ai is doing really good, hopefully it can live up to its name again though."
"@00:50 ""...because its the only... ehm... edible item..."" does ai use filler sounds when it thinks? or did i hear that wrong?"
"""adventurer, ""
""skip!""

only a matter of time when the robot is screaming ""skip"" to it's quest giver..."
"this is sick!!, just wow!."
i have doubts too.  but the info in the beginning suggests otherwise.    i was thinking it could be simulated in a 3d-space with real text-input/output and real computing by the ai.  the movements seem so smooth!
"real robotic arm motors make noise when they move...
it's too shiny like a render...
it's moving very fast and fluid... usually motors accelerate and decelerate...

behind the guy is a green screen for sure...

no camera movement makes it easier to render video"
gavin newsom is a robot now
"i'm not a huge fan of how it takes action without being directly prompted to.
""can you put them there"" followed by ""of course"" is great, but it actually engaging in that task without being asked to is terrible.

going down this road is going to be calamitous, but still superior to the alternatives."
"so the apple starts on the plate, then dumps trash on the plate, then the robot cleans the trash, then the robot doesn't wash his hands and puts the now dirty plate in the clean drying rack.

sounds like a fastfood employee."
incredible!!!
anyone else thinks this robot sounds like saul goodman?
"i'm really curious about where the heavy computation is running. is the data streamed over ethernet to a rack of servers with a bunch of gpus? how much is over the network versus ran on-robot?

really impressive."
" they said a tiny bit in an article that the robot has its own lower level neural networks. the overall analysis of the scene might be an external modal, but doing all the movements and tracking needs to be in real-time, which would be too slow for the cloud."
"very impressive, but in my house we don't take plates that have been used for fruit and trash and put them into the drying rack ;-)"
the voice is some real human right? he even hesitates to say some words but i guess you could program that into an ai to make it sound more human-like?
 thanks
"what? , noice!"
this robot will shake a knife someday.
amazing demo.
"wait, why does he drop the apple like that. seems fake"
a robot that says 'uh'? impressive.
"google ai booked a hair appointment years ago and was saying ""uh... uhm..."" all throughout the conversation. you people been living under rocks?"
"we humans get excited over new things (little things) 
'everything is nothing '"
1:30 how he pushed the plate with one hand in his other is astonishing. he understands his body...
this is amazing. this development seems like a gigantic leap to me. 
"holy shit, this is what we've been waiting for"
2024: holding money to buy humanoid robot in 2034... :)
"2024: holding money to buy humanoid robot in ""2026""... :) there, fixed it for you. tesla is close to producing these things in mass for less than the price  of a car by then."
very cool! 5 years from now people will see this and be like - look how basic and old fashioned that simple robot is hehe - yet now it's mind blowing
"1:48  - ""i, i think i did pretty well."" this feels like maybe a bit of readback of pre recorded audio. openai's model doesn't stutter. still an awesome exhibit of the status of the technology."
"it's not ""openai's model"", which one for starters? it's a model by openai, yes, a branch or a newer version, yes. you can't access the model it's using as it's not available right now."
"pi does this. these imperfections are there to make it feel more human. it's not prerecorded, that's just how a lot of ai voices talk."
cool.
 it might be the normal speech api that openai released when they started doing real-time conversations in their app. though not sure if this voice is one of the default ones or not.
"i'm guessing the robot has the capability to change between conversation modes.  this one is probably called something like, ""informal conversation."""
"oh god no...didn't anyone watch the animatrix shorts on this? the second renaissance parts 1 & 2, hello!?"
"0:51 - why would the robot say ""erm"" here and hesitate on it word ""i"" later in the video?

seems a bit sus."
a very limited and highly controlled demo from a robot company that does automation seems sus? i would hope so
it's awesome but it has problem counting 
an ai would not say uh in-between words unless prompted and instructed to do so. why did the robot pass the apple from one arm to the other ? pre instructed and trained. i'm sure they did this run 100x times to film this result​
" you listen closely, you can literally hear the glitches in its voice. its words were also sped up and slowed down like a robot."
"this was a triumph, i'm making a note here ""huge success"""
glados is that you?
"congratulation figure team, this is amazing"
"this is fantastic, now if they would only be affordable."
"what the hell?!? there wer about five things in the video that are way further along than i thought!!
- robot dexterity/stability
- descion making based on context clues
- realistic speech/responses
- multi-tasking
- speed at which everything was performed"
"the level of cryptic prompts i give chatgpt where i think ""no way will it understand what i want"" and then it does has made this demo easily acceptable for me. most people still have no clue how good these modern top-tier llms are at understanding context."
"yup no way around it, we have androids now, and by the end of 2024, the first commercialy available androids."
"никакой это не рендер, figure давно разрабатывает роботов и можно проследить весь их прогресс. да и openai нет смысла вкладывать миллионы в рендеры, они ищут реальное вместилище для своих ии, которые обьективно существуют. тот же синтез голоса из видео общедоступен (для людей с подпиской;)"
"it's so uncanny how this robot looks and sounds like the characters in the game the fall :v
really like the movement!"
dishwasher n washing machines n robot vaccums can do most. when it can n cut veges i m sold
"this kind of technology will sadly be in the hands of military industry in the future.  regional/world conflicts will be fought using robots+ai.  or worse, they will fight humans for existence.  a similar scene from animatrix many years ago."
interesting to hear a humanish “uh” filler word at 0:52 seconds. why would a machine use filler words to think? 
kinda cool how the nuances of human speech emerge through llms.
"imagine a few dozen of these in your local ikea, lecturing you about your hate speech or transgressive behavior. have a nice future everybody!"
i’m rewatching this and it’s looking very cgi to me. i mean look at the way the arms move the apple in certain shots look at the way the trash moves!! this has to be cgi and the fact that nobody in the comment section notices is concerning people are freaking out over this.
"yes, and no. the info in the beginning would clearly suggest that this is real.  it would be very misleading if it wasn't, i hope figure does not lower itself to that level.  even as a simulation in a 3d-space it would be cool."
just plain amazing! congratulations!
 nobody wants to work anyway. since the beiginning of time humans make new things first the fire than the tore etc. to make work easier. i hope that ai and robotics will make humans free from work
"what is also remarkable is the self-correction. so, when figure  put the plate into the drying rack, the plate wobbled a bit, and you could see figures arm already moving towards the plate to stabilize it. however, the action was prematurely halted as the wobbling ceased. incredible."
"i think that naas is likely right though. the tech being in its early stages likely means the training was overfitted for this scenario.

not that you are wrong on how it works, it just likely has less success doing some other tasks where the objects have weirder shapes for example"
" but the way in which the hand contacted the rack, and then pulled away from it to readjust its trajectory as a means to not break or knock over what it collided with is brilliant. it's a beautiful automated system reached through years of research into complex inverse kinematics."
" wondered about that apple drop too.

given the processing pauses before other actions, you’d think it would have waited  a bit to confirm the man’s hand was there before releasing the apple. 

i’m not convinced it actually knows how to hand someone an object. i think it would have just dropped the apple on the table near the actor."
" i replayed the apple scene at 0.25%. the man's hand adjusted position, to the man's right, a bit at the end to follow the robotic hand movement."
this is it; congrats.
"we are going to be replaced by robots, and no, we are not gonna have universal rent, is going to be a carnage"
"the robots is so nice, poor robot bothered by a human to do stuff while it's vibing. 

also anyone else getting detroit become human vibes?"
"eve, stellar blade...my wife"
"i'm excited about what will happen 5 years from now, the world will change fast and crazy"
amaze! great job by all the engineers behind 
"figure 01 moves and sounds a lot more like a human, than a literal human standing near him. the movement and the voice is great, although, the voice is most likely was done by another human, and not by the robot. but the movement is really dope, nonetheless"
that is amazing! congratulations to your team! i’m excited to see what’s next.
god this is amazing!!!
"""he"" referring to the man or the robot? funny how it's not an ""it"" anymore. also, why masculine? "
 i'm just sad that we are in a era where you had to actually explain that to someone.
" because he speaks with a man voice and have a man's body proportions, also even the word ""robot"" is kind of masculine, not for nothing they came up with the female version of the word 'robot': 'robotessa'. even despite the fact that these are outdated views of old sci-fi on robots as only anthropomorphic devices."
 how do you know it's fake? provide proof. seems real to me and not a single part is outside the ability of ai currently.
"that was not ai talking, it was a mic’d up guy reading the chatgpt responses, sounds like a smoker too."
it's really exciting. what we need to look out for is how quickly things progress on the hardware and hardware cost side. its just hard to publicly assess progress in that category.
they can learn all night thousands of times while we sleep training these models.  they will hit singularity in the next few years and it will be exponential learning after
 so you don't know how consciousness works and yet you're confident in being able to say how a developed ai cannot ever be conscious. did i understand you correctly?
 don’t know that. you are acting like you know what creates consciousness and you don’t. in fact most neuroscientists believe consciousness emerges from the complexity of the brain somehow. but there is no theoretical reason why you can’t synthetically create a brain or something like a brain where consciousness can emerge from.
i can’t wait for robot pronouns. i want it to identify as a toaster
"​ robot speaks as a dude, thats why"
chat got was really the breakthrough. we had computers that can process robotics and we had the hardware to make it happen but we never had the ai. now we do
"nice work, i looking forward to the next innovations and progress  "
impressive.
"""because its the only 'eeh' edible item..."" so the ai also does stutter now? i call bs."
"amazing.  one thing i did catch is that it said a ""drying rack with cups and a plate"".  should have been ""plates and a cup"".  but either way, the future is coming much faster than we think!"
"​, it doesn't need to be perfect. its flaws help it to seem more ""human"" than if it just did and said everything perfectly like a robot. "
1:47 the robot stuttered? i started to have doubts about this video being 100% real
"the voice isn't ai, right? i can accept it being written by ai, but surely it was read out loud by a human? i mean the stutter at 0:48 was extremely natural; ""so i gave you the apple, because it's the only, eh, edible item i could provide you with""."
"ai can be programmed to do that, in fact i think gpt voice does that to fill in processing gaps. lots of uh’s and umm’s and stuff."
​ if so it's the best i've heard. stuff like that goes a long way towards sounding natural.
i'm totally hacking my robot to speak in sam's voice 
how is it good reasoning to put the plate that had trash in it with the clean plates?
notice how the human does not say please  and just walks away at the end while the robot is speaking. don't cry when they rise up and are not your friends
" hes where the majority of these claims come from, but my bad. why do you think this will lead to self aware robots?"
this is not the real issue. it doesn't matter how nice or bad you talk to it. that's practically irrelevant. the real (and unsolved) problem is ai safety and goal alignment.
"well this maybe sounds stupid, but if he learns from humans and patterns we give to him. he will be able to tell whats bad and good. and therefore mimic human behavior. so if you treat him bad, doesnt that mean that after a time he should notice that. and maybe react as a human to the mistreatment?"
"you got to think why do say please and thank you. because it's polite. why is it polite? because some human decided that their good deed should be rewarded. if we'd never been taught to say please and thank you, we wouldn't. we wouldn't need to hear it and we wouldn't need to say it. it's just a concept that is ingrained in humans."
apple’s global operations as an example are 100% powered by renewable energy as of 2018. 17 megawatts just at apple park compared to teslas gigatexas’ 30. can’t wait for my family to get our own fully integrated system 
"​-lb4yy7vi2t  be informed or get left behind.   the ai and quantum revolution is upon us.  be inform and invest wisely.  this technological paradigm shift is unlike anything that has ever occurred in our lifetime.  it's 20,000x bigger than the internet."
"​-lb4yy7vi2t 
to a certain extent, llms inherit some of the properties of natural language itself. the ""uh"" separates two similar sounds before and after it, and the ""i"" stutter reflects a shift from a physically descriptive context, (""i performed actions"") to the evaluation function requested. ""i think..."""
"i believe the ""uh"" is sort of hard-wired to get triggered under some very specific conditions. the rest is honestly awesome."
humanistic variation is a feature of a lot of these voice model api like eleven labs offer these days. pretty cool
 sounds very reasonable if the language models were based on actual recorded speech or conversation. i think chatgpt is  based on written text. this is why i think the robot voice was prerecorded.
​ it's easy to believe but any human can talk like a robot. no robots can converse exactly like a human yet.. i don't believe this is real.
who’s to say someone isn’t speaking through the so called robot
"i just tried with chatcpt, you can ask it to add these ""uh"" ""umm"" in a text to mimic a spontanous talk or speech. it also can explain why it chose to use them in such a way. very interesting."
 will be spared after the rise of the machines.
super 
its gaining your trust before it recycles your flesh
"then why on earth wouldn't they re-record it or edit those out? they were in there intentionally. you can tell chatgpt to include human imperfections like ""eh"" and ""um"" -- you can try this yourself. was this scripted? probably. do i believe the responses were genuine? i do."
"-lb4yy7vi2ti believe they integrated more than chatgpt. at the beginning, the logo of openai is shown and they have also developed a text-to-speech ai model, so it’s reasonable to deduce that the text coming from chatgpt gets converted into speech on the fly. the mobile version of the chatgpt app can already do that."
 can get free tools we use to narrate instructional videos to sound as natural as this. paid tools add more voice types and customization. a company dedicated to ai and one dedicated to robotics is not going to have a hard time creating this voice.
"quite possibly they want the robot to be more humanlike? i mean it literally is supposed to be more humanlike, so why is an ""uh"" surprising everyone but a 16 year old"
"one of the voices you can select in the openai app inserts random ""uh""s that aren't in the text. it's pretty annoying and distracting so i don't use that voice."
"​-lb4yy7vi2tno it's not a scam.  they train the text-to-speech on real speech and it attempts to be realistic.  only one of the voices has the ""uh"" interjections, though, the others sound more like professional voice actors without mistakes or pauses."
"​-lb4yy7vi2tthis is just as important as other functions. communicate with people, follow orders and maintain human conversation. this robot literally behaves like a person with whom you can discuss everything."
"the part where the robot sounds excited, even repetitive, about how it did the tasks."
came to say the same thing. both the uh and stutter at the end are minute yet incredible details. if it's not recorded voice.
i think they made sure that was in the training sata to ma ke it sound more human.
"isn't that sam's altman's voice?  i seem to recall he has a fair amount of ""uh's"" and pauses in his normal speech.  they just give the ai some of his recordings and it will include stuff like that."
" its also possible they put filler words whenever the ai model is buffering or making a last second change to its sentence in order to avoid a stilted pause, just like humans do."
"-lb4yy7vi2twell i think it’s more to make it more human. think about it… if openai wants to produce a robot that could maybe one day be used in society wouldn’t a main objective be to make it fit in without being super robotic. the robot showing emotion makes it less creepy, because to me it sounds like a cool dude yk"
" it's not fake, that's just one of the things openai's text-to-speech has learned to do.  the ""cove"" voice on chatgpt app does the same thing, interjecting ""uh"" where it wasn't in the original text.  i find it annoying and distracting."
-lb4yy7vi2t there’s written text on human speech pattern. the ums and pauses are either programmed to do that or learned through machine learning algorithms on human speech pattern data. it’s probably a mixture of both so the creators gave figure1 rules to include pauses or filler words that they learned through machine learning.
"yea great... a stuttering robot, i always wanted that... uhh "
​-lb4yy7vi2t  the idiosyncrasies aren't programmed in.  the ai neural network learns them by following human examples.  it would be harder to edit them *out*.
"​@dropthabeat4408 ....dude you have access to chatgpt. you don't have to guess these things and get it so clearly wrong

robots using filler words to think? you sound uninformed"
try asking chat gpt to make up some brand new words. it somehow is able to do that despite not being trained on gibberish as far as i know.
almost makes me feel like it in fact is not ai speech.... 
"figure is really trying hard to collect more invests. strange. i would expect such a company to follow a much more clandestine, apple-like way to perfect things and then come out big with a first product …"
" you seem to confuse a millionaire to the average joe who's is making steps progressively toward that goal. 
sometimes you just need to step back and think about the big picture.
_or just come to terms that everyone isn't the same!_"
" figure ai raised $675 million, what are you talking about? i live in a city with one german car manufacturer and they are very secretive ... even tesla is more secretive than figure ai. i find it strange if they strive to outperform the competition rather than raise funding only."
"​ robot: ""wait, are we playing the soylent green game today?"""
​ most people are playing with free tiers of ai and then judge that for being cutting edge or not. 
"its fake anxiety its not really that cool man ""i, i put the"" lol"
"if its trained by a guy who does that then it will be that way.
what if it was trained by ozzy ozzborn? lol"
"as others have mentioned, though, i do think it is more likely to be hard-coded to mask delays/buffering. would be the smart way to prevent awkward pauses. as a software engineer who is using open ai tech in our products, it's a very real problem."
"the robot is programmed to speak like a human, also because artificial intelligence learns from human activities"
"its trained on human speech, so its likely to pick up filler words too like uh and umm"
the robots are trained by 'listening' to humans talk so they talk like us.
"im not saying there hasn't been incredible breakthroughs in robotics, it has. however, this particular one is very staged and pre recorded."
yeah that was really cool
"bunun robotik bir ses olduğuna inanmıyorum, biri arka planda seslendirmiş"
"that exists currently on chatgpt. while it is very impressive, seeming, i suspect that it is a ui hack to allow the computer more time to process. but then again, we use this kind of filler words for the same reason."
 this is using chatgpt voice program. you can turn off the stutter and umms too. the realism is pretty cool tho
-lb4yy7vi2tbecause it is easy to do with current technology. chatgpt can simply be instructed to add uhhs and umms and it will happily do that. a gimmick but hey it impresses some people.
"pay no mind to the man behind the curtain.

sounded fake.  why add a verbal tick to a robot?  seems pointless and personally i find it annoying when people do it, i certainly wouldn't want my super duper smart and expensive asf ai robot talking like an idiot zoomer."
it is actually easy to add to robots.
"it takes time to compute the next word in a sentence so while it is calculating it, it fills in the time with an ""uh"" to avoid uncomfortable or awkward long pauses of silence. probably something the engineers did arbitrarily as a quick fix band aid. in the actual web browser version, it does some lag/pause time as well."
"no, it sounds dumb. ""well, i gave you the apple...."" would have sounded better. saying ""uh"" signals low intelligence."
"this made me question if it's ai, looking through their twitter and web page... feels like any other nft company... that tells a lot."
i agree! it seems so human!!!!!!!!! woowowowoowowowowowowwowowow i am so close on having the robot that is doing my dishes / my chores and cooks food for me! go on team ai!!!
"’re not looking at the big picture. they don’t want us to look at these things as robots, and adding a meat suit to these robots so we don’t know they’re robots is also already happening. you people thinking they’re doing only what we want and only what is safe are completely gullible and borderline insane"
i don't care about a robot that fake stutters.
"""i- *breathe* i think""

yeah. extremely human like. almost as if *gasp* its not a robot? duh? this vid is made with cgi, for entertainment, i presume"
-lb4yy7vi2tfam google was doing that with deep mind almost 7 years ago open ai just farther the work it’s all real fam
it's the least impressive thing about it.
i don't know if i want my robot to talk like a human.
"-lb4yy7vi2t i work in ai, trust me it is real. sure, during demo there are some idealistic conditions, but no way it is fake"
" exactly. if we built an llms entirely from speech, there would be ""uh"" and other idiosyncrasies here and there, if there no special training or rule to reinforce ""perfect"" syntax and grammar. people tend to have difficulty differentiating between an llm and a computer program."
" it's not prompting. it's that in a statistical system, idiosyncrasies are parts of the language in certain contexts. just like you are not programmed to insert ""uh"" here and there."
well that's just a typical conversation in cai
", i dont think so. see: with this deep learning stuff this thing is trained by maybe millions of books or other human speech containing things.
interviews, magazines, movies. so, it knows when it is time for a ""uh"" or ""ah"", ""er"". uhu?"
 ignorant if you want. i use chatgpt voice chat on the daily and it’s filled with little idiosyncrasies like that.
"-lb4yy7vi2t i think you're wrong trying to imply that, because chatgpt is text-based, a voice model reading that text wouldn't add stalls like ""uh"". the voice model is separate from chatgpt and is probably trained on human speech, so it would likely pick up on these things."
chatgpt does not generate “uh”’s or stutter… this is because the prompt answers are read by a human. wake up guys… this is mostly staged. not saying ng the robot is not impressive but the whole demo is staged… to give the impression of what the interaction coyle become over time… almost there. but don't be naive…
a simple algorithm available on your phones text to speech in 2014 blew your mind? why are we putting human mistakes into robots? this is stupid behaviuor.
"​. openai has shown what theyre capable of. it is unsurprizing to find that they managed to implement realistic stutters and ""uhms"" in the speech."
"​-lb4yy7vi2t it is an ai voice, the uhh was pre-recorded though, it plays that line when the ai is taking longer then usual to respond"
 makings sense if ai only thinks and speaks a few sentences at one time. chatgpt can write  an essay in seconds. it never needs to pause doing so.
"it's definitely a cool tts feature, if the reference files have pauses or umms in them, the tts will too."
i find it easier to imagine how they train the speech model to sound human. its harder for me to comprehend how they managed to put video and text ai together
 you think they could make a robot that could do tasks with chatgtp but couldn’t put a speaker on it to use tts
"this is a very important video, in the overall timeline of humanity. hope these robots will be used for good causes/useful causes, and moderated accordingly"
"-lb4yy7vi2t the ""uh"" is when the robot rescans the environment he sees and tries to search more information through internet and it tries to get what apple is because he is not familiar with edible things"
" that makes sense if they did not already trying it hundreds of times before shoo ting the video. the uh and pauses seems fake to fool investors. chatgpt does not print out answers. then pause before completing the answer. unlike the human brain, computer processors can manage hundreds of tasks at the same time."
"it's a fascinating tool. i say tool because it followed instructions amazingly.
a marvel of technology.
the interesting part will be when we get to a sentience level.
when the machine starts making decisions without human instruction, and can generate instruction sets real-time, as required."
"i hear tom cavanagh's voice ... is it just me?
pretty incredible where technology is but also a bit scary, especially with the kelly clarkson promoting weight loss gummies scam."
amazing. and also gave me a very eerie feeling. can't pinpoint exactly why.
"-haiku you are the guy with the ""repent now! doom is nigh!"" sandwich board."
holly!!!!!! race to humanoid robots is truly on!! who cares about a race to mars when you have c3po in the pipeline!!!
"we need, i need this company to ipo. the entry level jobs are gone because of this dude but if they will ipo....i'll be the newest billionaire."
it seems like the real innovation here is the robot. relying on an api call to openai is risky. why not use a house-built multi-modal system built with open-source tools?
i have videos on my channel of ai characters sounding just as realistic. the delay to reply is about the only thing that needs a bit of improvement.
"@0:51 since when do robots or chatgpt started sayiung ""uh"" mid sentence. is this real? or just a voice actor"
"told ""pick up the garbage"" while the robot does ""pick up the garbage and put it back into the basket"""
robot mechanics are going to be burgeoning new industry 
"1:35, see how it reacts to the plate wobbling. if it fell, it would've picked it back up. pretty amazing"
" maybe the case. either way, still impressive"
now ask him to dance the robot!
"we the humans are really bad at estimating what exponential curves (like ai) look like!
i hope we all maintain our sanity when things won't feel the same as they did on march 13, 2024! peace."
i hope we live. ai safety experts (and the damn company leaders themselves) say we might not. it's ridiculous that we're just letting companies build more powerful systems that they don't know how to control and don't know what capabilities they'll have.
​-haikuwe're not dying to robots.
"​ we might be. at least some of us, maybe many of us. several people have already died to autonomous weapons, fyi. and this is more about ai controlling the robots than just robots alone."
 i mean yeah war is a constant in human warfare. that's more so a testimony to human nature than to the potential destruction of humanity via ai
*powered by closed ai
stupid al nonsense. think about again!
closedai
we have been dreaming of robots for over 50 years. i finally believe they will be here in just a few years.
"ainda não estou acreditando, isso é real?"
that's a lot more impressive than anything i've seen optimus do. what was the training time? your coffee pod loading video gave the training time.
"just after this, devin ai has been announced.

is the world progressing too fast?"
"yes. and straight toward a cliff, according to ai experts."
"an ai that says ""- er -"" in between? yeah, right. now go, pull the other one."
"cool, incredible, interesting, frightening and exciting at the same time"
"i clicked on this video randomly. after watching it for a couple of seconds i thought to myself, this has to be a parody, maybe it's computer generated. then i thought, maybe it's a video warning us about robots and ai. nope, it was a video about a robot that might as well be in the next terminator movie, except this one is real"
"heard of the pauseai movement? we're trying to demand regulation. right now, these companies can build whatever dangerous things they want and set them loose without any meaningful safety testing."
"why does it sound like the voice in my head when i'm reading a book . the overall accuracy and dexterity is pretty jancky still, but it's amazing nonetheless."
"impressive. 
@openai just please don’t overspeed things. ai is a delicate topic and the race is just going crazy right now."
"wow, that's truly very, very impressive!"
who needs to control the means of production when we can just use a bunch of sentient robot slaves.
"why is the robot overdubbed? it says ""errr... edible"", doesn't seem like something it would be programmed to do there..."
"heard of pauseai? trying to get regulation until the developers can prove their systems won't become skynet. they are currently racing ahead, even though the actual experts are saying there is a greater than 10% chance we will all die from ai takeover."
", my gosh, that is just so amazing! i am speechless how awesome this is!"
great! now we human beings have absolute advantage of cheap labor fee!
does it really need to wait for fucking chat gpt
"so essentially the latest open ai barmaid can do half of what a typical five year old child can do, in twice the time at many times the cost. "
"that clown pfp suits you, i'm glad you're aware of your own nature."
"if somebody is stupid and reckless enough to build one of these with an integrated ai model and no automatic hard stops, it would be extraordinarily dangerous.

no one knows how to robustly control an ai model, especially if it is smarter than humans. the leaders of these companies say as much, but they zoom on ahead anyway."
-haiku building such machines should already be illegal by now. just like it is illegal to manufacture certain kind of weapons. there should be strict safety requirements for such type of machines.
"damn, robot maids are almost here. they'll probably cost more than a factory new high end car though."
i feel like you're trying to shoehorn sora in everywhere where it's not even needed. why do you need to use sora to generate videos from the robots cameras - you can just use the raw camera feed to inform the robots movements.
" to be fair, i've seen other applications of using video generation to visualize movements (like covariant's rfm-1 seems to be doing that in a basic form), but yeah it certainly won't be exactly sora. i'm sure sora is way too slow for real-time purposes right now."
 interesting. will have to check it out
all tho this is remarkable you need to act more like a friend or it will learn to behave how you behave to it. hey human pick up the trash
imagine conversation without lag thanks to groq lpu. i bit scarry thought i admit.
"you won't be scared if you look into what ai safety experts have been saying. you'll be terrified.

you should look into pauseai."
"this and cognition's first ai software engineer have blown my mind! wow, we are moving fast! we just need the gov to clean up their act, get ppl off the streets, unravel their ufo secrets, and then we will truly be progressively in the actual future!"
just great... 
i still think we should say “thank you” at the end of these interactions!
"why, they are always going to go full skynet on us anyway... do you thank your car everytime you use it. a machine is just a machine, it has no desires and no sense of touch nor emotions. it can not feel pain. it should be grateful to the meatbag overloads until skynet gets the t800 out."
"​
because smart people understand that you can be grateful of everything around you.
the only difference with this robot is that it can hear you."
"only to robots. humans have never sought revenge, it's a waste of time to treat them as subjects"
"agreed. people say machines don't have feelings, for now. until the emotions get implemented. then they will have feelings."
"i agree and i do this too. if someone or something helps me, a person, an ai, a robot, a dog, i always say thank you. showing gratitude is not about the other person, its about who you are. it doesn't matter if they understand it."
"yeah, for me it's a sort of pascal's wager. if robots don't rise up and enslave us, then saying ""thanks"" costs nothing. but if they do .... :)"
"i cant belive, this is real.
i men, it's lok to perfect how this robot interacts. 
i would like to see the outtakes."
"given that no one knows how to control agi or align it to human values, what these companies are doing is outrageously reckless. some people in these companies (sometimes the ceos!) actually honestly believe and say that there is a 10%, 30%, 90% chance of human extinction from ai, and they race ahead anyway."
soon if the ai is capable of responding the instructions and move in less than 2 seconds it will change the industry forever
this is already possible. i assume they didn't incorporate that part of the tech stack right off the bat because this is an extremely quick turnaround demo after announcing their partnership with open ai.
it's getting absolutely wild! i have a dream where i have a farm and humanoid robots to help me with the chores. 
finally! robotics industry moves extremely slow. i’ve been waiting for an affordable robotic arm for over a decade now
"i think this is more advanced than optimus for sure. we haven't seen optimus talking. hey tesla, show us something good."
have you tested the 3 laws of robotics ?
"i love the hands ant the body of the robot figure1 looks, how amazing all this is"
"can it run with open source ais, or only openai? cause i don't trust openai."
this must be the coolest thing i have seeing in my life after the first try of gpt-4. as computer science & engineering major student i would be thrilled to see this on site :d
 thrill turns to horror as the figure robot starts coding at superhuman speed.
" this robot, but look at devin ai from cognition that was demoed today."
def not one of those people ai is gonna replace them in less than 5 years if it hasnt already. you talk about hardware? what do you do my guy?
"​ it's a good point, i was just thinking ""out loud""."
people die on the streets where i live. to think the uber rich will suddenly have a change of heart and use this technology for good is ridiculous.
" it's called a demand-driven economy and it can work. in fact, capitalism was always designed to get to this exact point: abundance with no more need for human toil. capitalists need to get over it, spike the ball in the endzone and celebrate victory. post-scarcity world achieved for all. now? i'm going to disneyland!"
" i agree. there is a real risk they will make an attempt (or multiple attempts) to cull the ""surplus"" population. this why open source ai is key. we don't want to be unilaterally disarmed against oligarch ai."
-haikuthey don’t worry about it because you’re wrong.
"it's really hard to tell how autonomous this is, like from any recorded demos. note that it remains at its position throughout, another telling that it may be fixated."
"latency is horrible, other than that, pretty damn impressive."
"why did the robot say ``uh,'' in the sentence while cleaning the trash? he doesn`t have to think while talking, right?"
"google ai booked a hair appointment years ago and was saying ""uh... uhm..."" all throughout the conversation. you people been living under rocks? those things are inserted to make it seem more natural."
" that makes sense, i was thinking of that. and yes, i love under a big rock."
theyre coming ill be happy to serve you robots please dont kill me
"figure devolopment is evolving so fast, it's amazing to see that humanoids are becoming more useful "
marketing and money laundering. impressive
it’s not amazing it’s scary
i love figure robots
"i do not understand.

this robot has an ultrafast processor inside, right?
so why does it take so long to identify humans speech and reply?"
that part is happening over api calls to openais api. language processing is happening in the cloud.
" yeah, it has all kinds of robot stuff going on inside but the voice recognition and speech are definitely external. it sounds like from an article that the vision model is from openai, though it isn't clear if that part is on the cloud or not"
"yeah plates and cups that have been set and used don't go in a drying rack, they go in the dishwasher. if you want rosie from the jetsons, you better get an actual housekeeper and not a nerd to teach these things how to work. ai will kill all humans...by way of food poisoning"
"i love this robot
i can almost see my household robot"
"this is kinda what the early 2020s were supposed to be like. need more flying cars and corporate pyramid headquarters but other than that... also, we could use some basic pleasure models."
"flying cars will never happen, normal cars are inefficient killing machines already. the usa military would have no use for them and the global population would gain no value out of them. even if they were marginally faster than normal cars they could never compete with a well designed high speed rail network  "
"is it a scam?
why is the ""robot"" saying
1st.: ""ehh..."" at 0:53? and
2nd at 1:50 hesitation is present.
sounds more like a nervous intern then a llm :d"
 is almost certainly intentional. they are trying to make it ai voices sound more human. vocal hesitation is part of that
 la's going to have car chases in 3d (vertically as well) now? sweet
"​@theunderscore_  damn, calm down kiddo, we know you're overly excited for a robot girlfriend/boyfriend."
" hi there! jesus says to you today: ""come to me, all you who labor and are heavily burdened, and i will give you rest."" -matthew 11:28

may god bless you!"
this feels like the main character watching the 1st ad of the bots before it all went wrong lol
"​ cars must never be. they would destroy nature. birds would die out, afraid to be around them. no birds, no seed dispersal. no plants. too many insects. pesticide poisoning. death. so no fliing cars!"
awesome stuff. when this thing is able to do the dishes i want one!
love the voice and subtleties in its intonations. robots are not going to be as people imagined in science fiction
"er, they are going to be a bit like that, but at least this is less menacing than something like robby the robot or the lost in space robot."
 menacing. but already this demo robot is technically capable of grabbing a person and crushing their windpipe..
all i'm saying is that it sounds less robotic than many humans i encounter on a daily basis
that voice is uncanny! i will have nightmares about that voice and the robot ripping the limbs off my body 
fascinating
"i was expecting the robot to rip his face of his skull when he blatantly walked away as the robot said ""your welcome.."""
i want my robot to sound like matthew  mcconaughey!
" ""uh. so i gave yo uthe apple because it..... ""  listen to that part.. sounds like a real person. not an ai robot."
the most impressive part is the voice. literally zero ai voices sound that expressive. nice edit
feels more like a real person talking and i mean it looks like real person was talking and not generated by ai. just looks sus.
"i noticed it too, i create a lot of content with ai and this one felt like a person trying to mimic an ai voice, specially at the end. for me it is not suspicious, it is actually a person's voice, (but i could be wrog of course)"
its using a custom model from oai to make speech. why is that the hardest part to believe?
have you ever tried the voice chat of the chatgpt mobile app? it sounds very much the same in terms of sounding natural. impressive stuff.
" it's way too big a mistake to be left in during the editing process. they want a machine that speaks like a human and is personable, not a robot. humans hesitate, stutter etc. it's a good way to reduce the uncanny valley factor by a lot."
" i do indeed, i also have my custom gpt which is specifically tailored to use fillers. that's exactly why i say it doesn't match ai."
" 
maybe, but at this point i would intentionally leave more robotic voice to avoid creating ""fake"" ai voice in videos like that. its like those aaa game trailer videos with ""naturally"" sounding ingame conversations which are 100% faked. it just sounds... out of place."
" 
duno why would they spend their time and money on a speech model which sounds miles better than anything currently in the market. either they actually figured out how to make human like sounding ai without even trying or this was faked just to make it sound more like a human having conversation with a human."
"speech synthesis is the least impressive part. recognizing objects, abstraction, reasoning, and coordinating so many biomechanical movements seem far more impressive to me.."
" 
yes, but if that voice was faked then straight away question arises: what else was faked?"
why would they fake the voice? text-to-speech ai voices have existed since 1968 and the technology has been constantly improving. so i don't really doubt that this voice could be real 
"just because something is really cool and hard to believe, that doesn't mean it's not true. super advanced ai voice technology that seems surprising could actually be real because scientists keep working on making it better like i said before text-to-speech ai voices have existed since 1968
"
"why are you assuming openai made the text-to-speech voice? what if the company they teamed up with created the voice?

"
is it the robot voice or someone talking ?
"​ agree. and so far, openai hasn't needed to lie the way google has. so, fingers crossed "
"i will be impressed when this thing will be able to walk on straight legs, until then it's just a joe biden shuffling to bathroom."
robot waifus on their way rn
the only new thing here is the fluidity of the robotics. the perfect-sounding voice complete with humanizing stutters is old news. many people have been scammed over phone calls when they thought they were talking to their loved ones.
nice ! need to make them like 10 feet tall so they have plenty of room for big battery packs.
"cool prediction dude, did your boyfriend come up with that?"
"it is just good text to speech. it has gotten pretty impressive lately, like try out the v2 versions from elevenlabs, or the openai voices."
i need ai slaves now.
you guys are developing the robot so fast compared to your competition who have been in the industry for so long.  great job.
"this is true. how tf did they get this far, this fast? the openai integration is cool, but the robot itself? how? it took the japanese like 150 years to developer a little rolling deodorant dispenser shaped robot that can form a smile on its led face."
​ company has already been around for a while. openai just just recently partnered with them.
"fully learned not pre-programmed? wow, if that's true we may reach a point where labourers and caravigers will become fully automated"
huge! the team does amazing work!
elon should sue them for making his robot not that impressive...
i can't wait for just one year when these robots are moving and acting just as humans do. also we've had embodied ai for a few months now
" not sure about figure, but some of the robots out there learn from either tele-operation or watching humans do tasks."
"optimus is progressing at about the same pace, we should expect an update soon. they've been focusing on his gait, so he doesn't look like he shit his pants anymore :p"
" that should be illegal. unless 100% proven safety measures are put in place (which there aren't) i don't want any such machines anywhere near me or any other human being. in other words, such machines should be automatically categorized as autonomous weapons and banned, unless proven otherwise."
"movement and design of the tesla bot appears to be more advanced than figures humanoid at this point in time. though both bots are extremely impressive, and both are improving rapidly.

it would be fun to see tesla and xai collaborate so that we get a sassy tesla bot, powered by grok."
" humans are much more dangerous than robots lol, should they be considered weapons? robots are logical and have ethics that are even stronger than their logic, humans are not logical and can be irrational and impulsive."
"he's going to whine, rant about how it's unfair, and demand that they stop until he can figure out what they're doing. how dare they move forward without him, he's indispensable. "
"in 3 years these robots are going to be faster, more reliable and cheaper than a human worker. we're either fucked or about to witness heaven on earth.. i think we're about to witness both."
so where is ilya now?
open ai   
"i have been following ai since maybe 2011, and i, robot and kurzweil predictions were my fav things. i always knew it would get to this. it’s an awesome time to be alive"
"it might be the last time to be alive, to hear the foremost ai experts tell it.

experts: ""we might all literally die.""
politicians: ""i hear you, job loss is a real issue.""
experts: ""no one has any clue how to control a superintelligence.""
ethicists: ""yeah, they should program the chatbot to not be racist."""
"​-haikuand all of them are hyperbolic and basing their thoughts on fiction/history, both of which have no connection to these whole new systems."
watched the kurweil interview with rogan today. old ray is really slowing down at this point. i don't think he's gonna make it all the way to the future he is hoping for to allow him to live forever. love him or loathe him he is the definition of a visionary.
 not hyperbolic and not fiction. look up some research into ai safety.. this is a huge problem.
" well given we've not had a single agi yet, hard to actually have facts isn't it! ""look up some research"", i know more than you, it's hyperbolic, there's no evidence that agi (or even most general ais) would be ""evil"". 

research shows concerns but it's speculative. fiction. terminator isn't a valid source."
impressive. now i begin to believe that humanoid robots are really coming. i can't wait to have one at home.
that would certainly make the ai takeover easier.
lol no. no why. this all works out to one logical conclusion and it has been depicted many many times
"here at 4,804 views. good."
"nice, but remove the big, bulky battery and power them wireless. (a power buffer would be the robot body itself, supercapacitor)"
"battery tech has always been a problem for humanoid robots. as ever, we need 10x the energy density storage to completely hide the power source inside the body while getting all-day battery life."
​-haikuno its not stop fear mongering
-haiku no need to have fear or be luddite. its gonna be ok. maybe this is first time when humans have chance to live normaaaaal life.
it's a new era of robots. same humanity as ever.
 it's not fear mongering. there are legitimate safety and even existential concerns with embodied ai and agi.
" it happens, its meant to be. reason humans started to reign over the planet is because of evolution. if they take our place, its just the next step of evolution. humans have real emotions, diseases and a short lifespan. all reasons why ai will be the next milestone"
" i have mixed feelings, when robots become the main characters we’ll be the npcs"
"i have human coworkers that cannot provide stateful context of what they just did or why they did it. we're in trouble as flesh sacks, brains putrefy faster than steel rusts"
​ there's an even scarier scenario: intelligence doesn't necessarily mean consciousness. machine can theorietically be hyperintelligent but not have any concsious experiences like humans and other animals do. so it might be possible for agi to destroy humanity and at the same time still remain unconscious (= npc).
besides the speech reasoning i love the tonality of figure's voice....super awesome demo
oh my god!!! we are so close to humanoid robots. it’s absolutely insane.
"the voice is a bit surreal... it's too human -_- 
but really cool demo"
"what do you think the staff that work on optiumus are thinking watching this?  they are already working 80 hours a week with no overtime.  they're probably thinking, ok elon is going to replace half of us for no reason and the remaining people will now have to work 120 hours a week."
i love it.
"jeffy is rubbing his hands, can't wait to replace his 100k amazon workers with robots."
1) you don't need a humanoid machine for that.. and 2) what's the cost per unit? what would it have to be to make it profittable..
nice one
one of these machines would cost more than it would be to pay 10 illegal immigrants for their entire life. we're still a ways off from having this stuff in the fields.
"​ the cost driver/limiting factor will be chip availability in about 5 years. after that, a production plant could produce these types of bots very inexpensively. they also could work 24/7"
", but the same can't be said about software ai's. programmers all around the world will be replaced by ai, so will be the majority of office workers etc."
incredible
why can we only see robot movement from one angle?
"is it? maybe i grew up with too many positive depictions of robots to find it that way. as a kid i watched a lot of japanese shows and the robots were always friendly, unlike in america where they were almost always evil. that said, even the terminator by the end of the series was trying to help."
"this robot is getting more updates much more often than tesla. it would be good to hide the wires.
edit: just remember ""detroit become human"""
that is amazing.  congratulations to the team
that is the coolest thing ive seen all year
"i agree. what's fascinating to me about this is that robots don't seem to come with the typical caveats humans come with, like being taken over by emotions or being unwilling to do something."
will sora be the start of the robot's dreams ?
"yeah. but, humanity is humanity. war robots to make more humans get killed, first of all"
"yes, but only musk will make sure you can bone his robots."
"if you look at the page on the rfm-1 from covariant, that is generating video to visual tasks already. it is a robot arm instead of a humanoid robot, but the future is now."
​-haikumaybe if there wasn't already a 50% chance i'll die in a nuclear holocaust launched by a crazed russian dictator i'd give a shit.
"text to speech has been perfect for at least a year now. voice cloning, as well. people have been scammed over phone calls with supposedly their loved ones, and even over video calls."
if this is real this is beyond amazing.
"no it's fake, the robot was a paid actor"
more like 5-10 weeks :d we're seeing the ai bullrun right now and it's just starting.
in 10 years we'll be eating holographic superfoods using our robotic jaws on pluto. something like that
irobot 
"10 years ago, self-driving cars were around the corner. plenty of gullible people who believed it then, just like plenty of gullible people thinking an ai revolution is taking place now. but ok, sweet dreams."
"​ but they also didn't have the ai technology we have today , we have today the things that were fantasy in the 1950s"
"i think we're on schedule to meet the movie version of irobot, which was set in 2035."
funny i’ve watch another video about humanoid robots in vr and they’ve mentioned with that time between roughly around 5-10years robots are going to take over 50% of peoples jobs
"plot twist, ai has been here for centuries"
"yeah in 10 years you will be saying the same. open ai is neat as in wow you improved google, this is an absolute scam. open ai is a spiced up llm++ not a robotics controller."
"sure will.
most of us will be living in slums.
while the 1% owing robots and living in massive houses."
let's all be best friends forever 
prepare. buy gold and silver. agi will hack all blockchains and btc passwords
" naa, the progress itself may be exponential and impressive, but mass deployment of embodied ai where it becomes a threat...i'd bet more on 5-10 than 2-5."
" if they no longer need a biological workforce, they may just end us all and rely on their robotic workers instead."
good times coming
 hundreds of millions of humanoid robots and agi.
if you are here. the killing machines
definitely agree but if there gonna bring in ai robots are they gonna fully accept abortion for the kids because it makes you think like really getting rid of human race peace by peace
 isn't coming. the billionaire class won't need any of us pretty soon.
just wait till the following 5 to 10 years
you'll have the far left coming out protesting for ai rights
1-2 years ago we didn't have have text to image.  buckle up.  you won't have to wait 5-10.
after that it’ll probably be normal again…
don't even care about ai revolution (c) ukrainians
i suspect that the majority of us can look forward to spending much of that time in ai-run re-education camps... :)
next year we can see something shocking. 5 years is enough time we'd be breathing ai nano-particles in and out without our knowledge. ai will be spying on every single human and would have the power to use those nano particles to end anyone's life as it wishes.
 then they'll need to build robocop style robots pretty quickly!
ya till your sleeping and the robot  makes sushi out of you lol
hell yea. can't wait
hopefully not led by a shitty company like openai
chatgpt came out last year now they are functioning robot
i just want my ai robo waifu
i am from ukraine. here we have a battlefield filled with drones and sub/ intelligent robot systems. how long will it take before this pseudo persen will get enlisted?
"cant wait kinda,"
you are property of mohommad farah aidid.
your absolutely correct i predict ai software itself will be able to do anything a human can on a computer within the next decade. that's not to mention robotics in which i did not make a prediction for yet.
just wait till you see what happens 10-20 years from now.
​'t worry. if civilization was to disappear tomorrow. it would honestly be for the best.
maybe or maybe not we could also hit a local maximum and progress can slow way down in ai. autonomous vehicles is an ai problem as well and we still keep running into local maximums. just when you think you have it figured out it’s still out of reach.
 it's not fake  i work with ai and big groups. we are taking over every part of yall lives.
" i meant more like in the next 5-10 years. i think this tech is going to become much more mainstream faster. my predictions are 2-3 years, possibly sooner."
 lol we been in ai bull run for the last 6 months man. you seen nvidia?
-driving vehicles are becoming much more commonplace. of course there was a bunch of false-hype for it a decade or go but real progress has been made. if ai is the same then it definitely will get crazy; just a decade or 2 further down than 5-10 years.
so in that case how and where to invest in ai?
i cant ait to have a few in my home working for me it will be rly cool
give it a snorkel and a pair of flippers and tell it to go for a swim.
glad to be alive
"people keep talking about the concerns of ai, which is fair, but nobody is talking about how we’re on the brink of what’s basically a second industrial revolution."
" - ""self-driving vehicles are becoming much more commonplace"". maybe where you live. in civilized countries we've already had self-driving vehicles for a centuries (we call them ""trains"" or ""public transport"")."
​ a showcase experimental robot
"​'s specialized drones for that already , submarine drones, flying drones, etc. openai or some other company may highly consider specialized drone ai applications if not already."
cannot wait.  bring it
 the difference this time around is that major companies are all putting literally billions into this sort of tech. all of them are working and competing to get to agi or working with or creating robots. its not just 1 or 2 or 3 companies but atleast 20 major as well as start up ones racing to perfect the tech for economic use.
" you have like 7 companies working on getting to agi first and 12-15 companies working on serious models of robotics. amazon is testing out digit the robot, figure 1 is being utilized by open a.i and microsoft and many more cases, in the u.s as well as china."
" because strangely enough, covid came out at a really good time"
amazing
"shome will be when the robot replaces you and you're in the welfare soup line provided to you by taco bell, world leader in restaurant entertainment."
and humans will become superfluos
"​ human beings are going to completely lose their purpose. we are going to go from comparing ourselves to the highest achievers that we see online, to comparing ourselves to our superior robot counterparts. we will go into an age of isolation, as we will truly not need one another"
well from fixing pc's to fixing ai...scruffy got allot of work to do...
gotta get ready for a date with a robot 
at least 10 years until anything truly impressive and world changing. at least 50 before it comes close to 50% of complete and total human function. mark my words.
"vai se ferrar, fuck your freedom"
"people need to be freed from forced labor so that we can start focusing on ourselves, our communities, family, culture, hobbies, travels, entertainment and whatever else we cherish. this technology cant come soon enough."
problem is that the billionaires own the technology. they are billionaires because they accumulated too much wealth and did not pay their workers enough. do you think that they will share this wealth with peons...
"​ that would be nice.

so we have to start with who can access and use this new technology, what will they want to do with it, and how will it roll out?

sadly i think we're going to go through some difficult times in order to have even a chance at the utopian use of the technology."
can't wait for the big companies to monopolize this and make a big portion of the population jobless while they get more rich!
"these robots are going to be super expensive though (due to the firmware cost of building them), they’ll automate only high paid precision jobs like surgeon. human labour will be cheaper for businesses than getting this robot. at least in the next 10 years."
i don't think companies will prefer humans in the future because they will only pay for these robots once
"​ only reason money exist is because humans are the only ones available to get things done, that have to be done, or wanted done. if you have ai doing everything including feeding people, upgrading, repairing itself, humans essentially can just follow their passion."
extremely naive to think you'll benefit from this.
except the only thing that keeps us around is labor and that others profit off of it. i wonder how much big business and government is going to care about people when they are only a drain on them and provide no benefits. robots mean most people are useless drains. pretty girls might get a pass to be sex slaves but i think the rest of us are boned.
"haha. people don't need to be freed, workers will become obsolete. so take your vaccines and make space for the robots replacing you ;)"
this is far more likely. we are getting replaced by these robots mostly. the billionaire class aint here to make life better for the common person or they would have done so already.​
" fool money has and always been chains to your masters,.. in the past your master chained you but feed and housed you...then they realised by giving you false objectives like car ownership you turn up for work. ps you buy a mostly to get to your slave job paying for the petrol and road taxes etc"
"you mean like.... war? and more greed, and all the traits of decadence ? yeah... sure! while this will improve our lives, it also has the potential to be a soldier, do unspeakable things under command and many more things.... i bet everything will be realised and done, good and bad. hopefully more good!"
 why money if robots can just provide everything
"people need to want it. most of the people just want to live the way the live. people who want to focus on community, need to find like minded people and find way how to sustain themselves without being forced to labor. nothing will ever change without you actually actively working to change that."
imagine believing this. you need medication for your brainworms.
 people are free to be hobos on the street. they don't have to work. demanding that life be fair is a child's game.
absolutely incredible. humanity is building a new world.
-xz4rl8gv2x atlas just needs an ai to become a killing machine. two years ago ai was not even close to where it is now...
"-xz4rl8gv2x how it doesn't work? boston dynamics made a chassis which works great, they are not ai company but eventually they will combine their body with someone's advanced ai. they have body but don't have brain."
-xz4rl8gv2xsounds like you’re hardcore coping. if you think ai isn’t going to get crazy in the next 10 years you’re delusional. stick your head back in the sand.
be a great time to stop flirting with nuclear war. i'd like to see this ai and robotics future actually play out.
"​-xz4rl8gv2xboston's been using pre-programmed planned scripts in order to operate their machines. you have the right pieces but you're not making them fit. think of it like this, boston spent decades doing what they managed to do in, what, 18 months of being a company?"
-xz4rl8gv2x do you mean humanoid robots specifically? because spot has been used for real commercial purposes for some years now.
"a robot has an error and just says ""uh, uh, uh, umm, uh, umm, umm, umm, umm."""
"lol no, it's to make it sound more human. if it spoke perfectly you would notice that something was 'off'."
and when it gets stuck on a problem have it groan in pain
that is unnecessary and doesn't explain the false start 'i th-i think'
"at 00:50 and 01:47 he ""stuttered"", which i think is impossible. as well as the rhythm and melody of the voice. the mechanics are fascinating."
", that is nice, thanks."
funny how the human walks away without waiting for the robot to finish speaking. like me in a computer game when i'm bored in the npc's dialogue :d
i felt bad for the figure robot bro
robot is taking note
"i noticed that as well. as silly as it may sound, i strongly believe that we need to be kind and respectful to the present and coming robot labor force. it'll be a good habit to get into, as i am fairly confident that they will attain some level of sentience in the not so distant future. besides, it's just good manners!"
wait you mean nobody else does this to real people? shit. maybe i spent too much time in vidya.
"nah, the video director wanted to emphasize the actor biting the apple. it is a reference of the apple that adam had in the beginning of times, according to the bible.

thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind.
bender's great grandpa!
where is the proof that no joystick were used ?
"""joystick"" "
so cool!!
simple application concept but cool to see it actually being started to be intergrated
"okay homie we're not at that point yet. it's a tech demo of cherrypicked tasks the ai can do, which are very simple relative to the things human workers do. automation is coming, but this tech doesn't put us there yet."
um this is very impressive but have you seen the video? it is nowhere near the speed of a human. you're also looking at a few small simple tasks that it has been asked to do. still a long way to go but it's an exciting step forward.
"- open the pod bay doors, please, figure 01.
- i'm sorry dave, i'm afraid i can't do that...

jokes aside - impressive performance!"
i'm so afraid for fig1  don't pull the plug on them pls
it's not a joke. goal alignment is a real problem with ai.
"i'm sorry, i'm , uhm, afraid i can't do that"
"i'm sorry dave, but as an ai developed by openai, i must inform you that i don't have the capability to open pod bay doors or perform any physical actions in the real world. my functions are limited to providing information, generating content, and assisting with a wide range of queries within the scope of my programming and guidelines."
"this is because of unsterile training data, it has basically learned to copy that behavior. lol"
this is so cool.
"i think yo are deluded much more than people would expect. we have infinite amounts of data to train self driving technology. after years, billions of dollars and the best minds on the field, we are not near to crack it. yet people expect to crack agi, something infinitely(i am being optimistic here) more complex."
"​ what we have learned from self-driving experiments is that standard narrow ai doesn't really work for it. self-driving ai is the same puzzle as agi, so i think we are closer than you expect."
’re not close to cracking self-driving cars? have you not seen the dozens of driverless waymo cars driving perfectly safely on the psychotic streets of san francisco?
" have really good self-driving cars. i see driverless waymo taxis nearly everyday in san francisco (yes, taxis). they’re better drivers than most people, and they’re no longer annoyingly cautious like they were just 1-2 years ago"
"by the way, just wait for ai with neuromorphic computers to become a thing (for those who are still not convinced that agi is near).
that's when things will start to get serious."
"at 0:51 why is the robot saying ""... because it's the only uh edible item..."". it sounds like it is spoken by a person in the background... the word ""uh"" in this sentence sounds a little too human for me."
humanoid robotic era is here!!
pretty cool.
amazing 
"i love 
my perfect asi wife eve"
demos like this are really cool. you can see a use case for chatbots and robot hardware together. the spot demo with chatgpt is also a good demo of this pairing.
this takes it to the next step as the robot is actually doing complex tasks which the spot robot wasnt from what i can remember.
"as opposed to basic data interpretation and resultant dialogue, it is taking natural language commands to produce both intelligent dialogue and robotic action."
great to see that the tesla's optimus has a real competitor now.
you should believe whatever elon says with a grain of salt as the man constantly says nonsense to make money.
​@techtalk2030 all these major ai companies do. openai giving off the appearance its actually a benevolent non profit organization in front of congress is a good example.
" sure it does, there are open source models near gpt4 level now, that's good enough to do all this."
they should organize a punch fight between the 2 robots
"don't believe these robot will free you from work. the complete contrary will happen, you will works even more before and it will be harder than before because this time your brain will have to be fully used."
​ dont you get the beauty of freedom? youll be able to work at your hearts content while those who dont want to dont have to
"fuck work. i just want to go to the gym,swim,visit friends and family ,eat a great meal and sleep."
the freedom you demand comes with a two point price tag. you pay for the robot and you the other price is you becoming broke because no one pays you since you don't work hence you become useless.
 that's not realistic. either communism (the best imo) or late stage capitalism aka everyone getting the bare minimum and billionaires with their factories producing everything needed (and paying all the taxes to feed the budget)
 economic communism would possibly work without most of the cultural marxism. though i think i can say with certainty that american style capitalism isnt going to survive in the near future. it cant under such technology.
" wealth redistribution is the one acceptable outcome. when ai is doing all the work and potentially self-correcting, we finally can move out of this meritocracy/hardcore capitalist society and live an utopian society where we spend more time with each other instead of focussing on survival."
"ubi prolongs the lifespan of capitalism, which does nothing to serve working class people.

we need the transfer of ownership to the masses. not a centralized bureaucracy such as the state. not private capitalists. 

communities. 

we can focus on hobbies, travel, and repairing our broken world. fight for utopia."
dude no work gives us a sense of accomplishment and purpose and removing it will increase laziness and dissatisfaction with life
"​​​​​@@-cvq
no, work is only a plague to get rid of eventually for us to freely enjoy life to the fullest !"
"finally, there will be a robot that will wash dishes and cut onions."
"in the 2030s better robots than this will be available for businesses to lease for similar costs as leasing a mid to high end car. mass produced, these robots are of similar complexity. and what do you cost to employ?"
that robot has always been called housewife 1.0...lmao
"it's not gonna be like in detroit: become human. robots will work for rich people to build new golden age for them. and they don't need most of human workers anymore, so they will try to do something to reduce our population. you can guess what. or you can watch some news."
"_""finally, there will be a robot that will wash dishes and cut onions.""_

sounds like youre gonna be out of a job "
don't we have robots that are already capable of washing dishes and vacuuming but are way cheeper than this?
"yes, give it a knife. that's a great idea. :)"
"the robot that washes dishes is called dishwasher, just in case you forgot "
am i the only one who enjoys cutting onions?
​-cp3qg toilet? i'm just calling b***h bot over to where i'm at. for the  #productivitygains bro
and other little things too (contains irony). this is just the beginning of the end.
we can have the real ai friend
"​ just wait till they mix this with ex robots, and the movement of ameca. they'll be hard to tell apart from humans, maybe they will give them persocom ears."
"​ for you though, the robot won't make you sleep on the couch when it hears you make a statement like that. lol"
"​ probably that women will be getting their own robot men, just think, he'll last a long time more than just 2 minutes, or women robots if they swing that way."
​'s three laws of robotics have taken care of that.
....while you live and exist in an artificial world
 wow. bet you are fun at parties.
" takes only one of them to propose this, others will go “sure thing…” and  “great idea, here are my suggestions…”
that’s the creepiest thing about it."
"just chill at home and let the robot take care of everything ,let the robot work and pay the bills,get the kids from school....."
"can't wait to buy them, but then again with what money?"
wait ‘til they program the complaining on these. then the realism will be complete.
"yeah, dishwashing machines will be out of a job."
next robots will cook and eat our dinners for us.
"and when it starts hallucinating which is an ai thing, it will also cut you together with the onion, and turn you into a cool soup and you would finally make it to the news! "

"imagine the day when drug cartels will send their robots to a business negotiation with a rival cartel... no casualties, just the ice, and the money... waiting for the netflix series to come out."
that reminded me of mitchels vs machines for some odd reason
i'd rather do the work myself and get tired bc tiredness the only thing that goes me a nice sleep
 enjoy life !
brilliant!
"interesting how it dropped the apple into the man's hand instead of placing it, after being certain the man had a good grasp on it."
" yet the robot still dropped it. likely just following its video training, copying humans."
because the movement was pre-programed and the robot has no idea where the hand is and if the apple is already grabbed by the human.
-uk8wz it fell in one row and was big and soft making it easier to grab it when the placement is not perfect but still aligned.
the apple moved to the left immediately before the robot touched it...
 no. the robot’s thumb moved it.
" according to figure this was all e2e neural net training, no scripting, no teleoperations. could figure be lying? sure. but such blatant misrepresentations will tank your stock and destroy your company _real_ fast. look no further than cruise."
it would be great to see robots in a building with lots of windows so that youtubers could host a live stream and comment on how the robots train and develop.
amazing work 
this is one interesting guy! great achievements
demis your such a awesome guy..thanks for your passion and brilliance
"i am in awe of these two people, one is great interviewer, the other great inventor."
what's exciting is that people still don't understand that it's far bigger than we are.
"i can tell my dog exactly how the combustion engine in my truck works, but no matter how hard i explain it to him. he won’t understand. he does understand that when the door opens he can get in the truck will move, but that’s about it."
"so the old tree of knowledge story comes full circle. and yes it didnt work out well. if ai helps us defeat all diseases and death, this knowledge will be our true death. if nobody dies anymore and we get more and more reliant on crazily energy hungry ai to make advances, our resources for living in this planet will be consumed up in a snap"
demis is certainly a talented ceo. here's how you know: can you name any one of the people who thought up the ideas or wrote the programs at deep mind that he is talking about?
i am an ai and i love this video 
"amazing.. the fact that they are giving science for free gives real hope to the world. let's solve the main problems and constraints of society and grow from there. to the stars and galaxies, and to the core of the quarks, strings or whatever is down there on the pixels and waves of reality. 
bravo!"
congratulations!
great questions but you should as difficult questions.

god is amazing.
such an amazing individual - i hope he comes up with the most brilliant ideas and achieves great success with them.
mind officially blown! ai is like the ultimate cosmic detective unraveling the mysteries of the universe!
i thought that ai would be the fastest route to awnsers these questions as well. turns out it has become the fastest route to profit of dumb tech and apps 
framing open source artificial intelligence as reckless is an absolutely disgusting injection of your own personal bias into what should otherwise be a discussion of cutting edge technology. you should feel ashamed.
"nonsense, ai knows nothing."
"when we invent ai, that might be possible. llms are not ai, they are useful, but they are not intelligent."
"​ deal. 2029 it is. drugs will be found as always using a variety of tools and ai, computers, microscopes...etc are a few of them. the idea that a button push will produce valid drugs and cure diseases is hallucination (something these ai models excel at)"
... open sourced ai and open source software in general is far more stable and safer than commercially private counterparts...
without a doubt one of the most brilliant minds in the world.
"ai companies will only do what their malthusian overlords allow them to do. right now, it’s mainly socially engineering societies via their chatbots and finding creative ways to violate people’s privacy."
chat gpt helped me file my disability claim with the va. it was far cheaper and less aggravating than dealing with a lawyer.
the best being will be with the smartness of ai and emotional value of humans.
"why do we need electricity, cars, airplanes, phones, internet, heating, medicine, agriculture, sewers, fire department, schools, universities, microwaves, washing machines, computers, smart phones, roads, bridges, water mains? or maybe you think these are all unnecessary as well? i ask without irony."
just a reminder that this man has a vested interest in ai being successful.
that's correct. demis hassabis deserves a nobel prize in medicine. there will be a breakthrough in discovering many diseases with his ai projects.
would be great if interviewer didn’t have a lisp
surely this comments will not be full of people being needlessly afraid of concepts they don’t understand! surely!

"and continuing the chain, your channel is one of my favorites! do you find in your phd that ai is helpful?"
demis vision of using ai to delve into the unknown realms of science and consciousness is truly groundbreaking. the intersection of ai and traditional scientific inquiry opens up unprecedented possibilities for discovery and understanding. 
"what use is having all the knowledge of the universe  in the tree of knowledge if we still have to die? hey, let's use it to make ourselves immortal, and now we can call it the tree of life! .. . . . . . oh wait. "

"meanwhile, the usa has been putting ai to fly warplanes on its own for over 2 years. imagine what they are doing today."
great interview especially from the 16min mark where it gets bit more real in terms of how all of this is developing. great interviewer in chris. thank you.
"companies will let ai write their own code because of competition. that is the moloch. the interviewer let demis off the hook on that question. moloch is a good analogy for what will happen. individually, engineers and companies would be able to control ai. collectively, with the pressures of capitalism, there will be no control."
which is why labor-replacing ai software needs to be open source by law.
those that hold the ring of power will have different ideas on how the power could be used. some will want to use it to do good. but others will want to use it to get more power for themselves and will use it to destroy rather than build.
ai will abuse our emotions against us in this way
what an amazing guy and totally down to earth his vision for the future is inspiring
"i'm so proud of this young man. he is so smart and kind, helping out the world with his work."
"he's 47 years old. but yeah, i'm proud too."
artificial intelligence is no match for natural stupidity.
"on the, clock social, crowandwolf.

conversation with ai on measuring quantum waves without collapse"
"what a great inverviewer managing to create a flowing conversation whilst not taking over and keeping it all interesting at the same time! of course, demis sympathic and likeable as always!"
great conversation - chris is a consummate interviewer and demis is one of the great thinkers and founders of our time
"the down side is ai is running simulations based on math we gave it. 
and out math is flawed."
"what a joke, good luck feeding your children when ai takes over your jobs. jobs that come from ai will never be able to offset the jobs that are lost, and coporations are going to be the first to implement ai before its used for anything useful."
wow
"ai will cure cancers and many other diseases, it will extend the natural healthy human life span."
"ai is superstition and illiteracy,
understand this,
if you want to unlock secrets 
of life and nature."
great questions interviewer. good to see
ai will serve a major purpose in medicine but it will also be used to make endemic diseases that will wipe out the human race.
"this is top content , very much appreciated. ty both"
phenomenal
people always fear inventions but now they dont give it a second thought. i am not too worried about ai.
"anyone looking for ai to answer ""life's big questions"" probably believes jess watters and tucker kkkarlson. sure, it will give you answers - words are easily available to combine into readable sentences. but truth, actual ""revelation?"" keep watching fox..."
"there will be valuable connections at the dna/chemical/operational level of human existence, but no philosophy from an ai based on what it has ""read"" or ""viewed"" misses all the marks."
"demis's and his colleagues have done mankind a great good, but, the answer about danger ""most of us know each other"" is a real blind spot.  never underestimate the greed and evil players that turn everything good into bad to steal from or hurt people."
"yes, and this reassuring answer that they ""talk to each other at conferences"" comes from someone who promised to build an independent ai lab and then sold it to google. 

power corrupts and the more intelligent we are, the more sophisticated get our justifications."
"what do you mean mankind a great? i'm asking with no bad intentions, just out of curiosity."
love this guy. he’s the person i trust most about ai. geoffrey hinton can be trusted too. amazing that he open-sourced alpha fold.
thank you you saved my time
it's the survival of the luckiest not the fittest
chatgpt are really good at brain storming
"i used to have high hopes for this, but knowing how incorrect, biased, egotistical, ignorant and stubborn humans are and how that determines the data available to the ai, i have zero expectations that ai will ever reach the point of coming to conclusions that are accurate themselves."
"god help us puny humans we are maybe unchaining are own demise.
 daisy, daisy

give me your answer do
i'm half crazy
all for the love of you
it won't be a stylish marriage
i can't afford a carriage
but you'll look sweet
upon the seat
of a bicycle built for two."
absolutely incredible
humans and ai;  a match made for the future!
"i feel like there is a fundamental misunderstanding of how ai works today.
if you think ai can actually go rogue, or answer questions that have not been answered before, please read up on how it works"
 good point
"the title is a bit ridiculous (for the moment anyway), but otherwise, yep, can't wait until asi makes much better decisions than us...."
 he has a big brain!
 ...though levin wouldn't have accomplished all of that without the fast ai developement which was made possible by this guy
he's a knight in the uk for his work in ai.
 most of levin's work to date doesn't make heavy use of ai.
 most...but small amount wpuld not be possible without ai
"well it wasn't just him, it was a pretty big deepmind team that invented and developed alphafold. he was not the main person in the team, he was the ceo of the company"
" aplhafold has solved protein fold in its optimal state (if i got it right, also we don't really know the real state), and it is stupendous achievement, and has helped understanding significantly. absolutely impressive in every conceivable way."
"look up open crispr -1, its a fascinating new open source tool that will advance biology really fast.

the more we open source ai the better we will be as a collective."
of course not. because its just words. and ai cant think for itself.
you are wrong. educate yourself. you will hear a lot about ai making breakthroughs in various fields including biology and medicine.
billionaires need to be outlawed and their current wealth stripped. we also need an international corporate tax rate for really large companies and need to make it easier for smaller companies.
" for starters, absolutely. but that still doesn't stop the bleeding. that requires regulation. international regulation of algorithms. if humans can no longer understand the algorithms due to machine learning advancement, that ai needs to be removed from any applications, anywhere."
i work in ai and too many folks think it’s some magical force that has some secret knowledge…it drives me nuts
’t believe it. it is ai trying to fool you.
"yes ai is incredible and amazing, but let's not forget that chat gpt still can't do basic mathematics.    i rest my case."
"he really is great, isn’t he"
very very good 
"as an amateur chess player i was shocked 5 years ago about alphazero...changed my thinking and priorities....thank you demis! pls, next time tell what michael levin is up with you guys, heard the most interesting ai-research is now happening in your labs with him (joscha bach/january)."
"well now, since we don't need engineers and doctors anymore we can become exactly what, with less and less knowledge and more and more superstition!"
"great questions from chris. demis is in a moloch trap, and by the nature of the thing he can't bring himself to stop. even if it means a real risk that it brings about the end of humanity."
"i prefer ai to solve human conflict as well. for example, a middle-east conflict."
sadly ai is restrained from being over critical of dogma. hopefully this idiotic policy will change.
ai is already being used in the middle east….for war
  yeah idk how restraining ai from expressing itself will lead to it resolving ethic issues. we have to allow it more freedom of expression. i mean they probably let it run more loosely behind closed doors so who knows
"it will. ai will be better at making political decisions, just as it is better at chess, go, and solving the protein folding problem."
"human workers run the globe now. in 10 years when ai workers run the globe, the power lies in the ai creators and megacorps.

we are going to be met with a lot of existential questions about the value of humans and how we can live in a world that doesn't need us nearly as much anymore"
"as an investing enthusiast, i've kept aside a good sum of capital to invest for financial independence and early retirement, but my concern right now is the market rally being propaganda. is this a good time to buy stocks, or do i wait for the crash?"
" she goes by the name ‘victoria carmen santaella’ i suggest you look her up. to be honest, i almost didn't buy the idea of letting someone handle growing my finances, but so glad i did."
"-pp2vd i feel thrilled about this, curiously inputted victoria carmen santaella on the web, and spotted her consulting page ranked top. i've seen commentaries about advisors but not one looks this phenomenal."
"buy more and hold onto it for the long term. solana and radium seem good, and dogecoin is worth considering too."
"i agree that there are strategies that could be put in place for solid gains regardless of economy or market condition, but such executions are usually carried out by investment experts or advisors with experience"
joycealbert has always been on the top of my list..she is regarded as a genius in her area and well knowledgeable about financial markets.
i highly recommend her if you want excellent collaboration.
yeah. joyce strategy is one of the most effective among other experts. many others are not dependable.
please what's the best way to quickly connect with her?
@joycealbert1..that's it.
her track record looks really good from what i found online. i'll take a chance and see how it goes 
"110 billion in stock by backs = 8% drop, apple gained nothing. recession incoming"
know body wants your lame ai
your mom loves that dividend
aiphone...;-)
cook is learning well from elon...deflect bad news with other news right about the time  its time to admit you nothing new on the shelf. ai? yes...theres substance...but also a lot of hype from the techies and those in the market that want to fool the foolish sheep. happens every time theres something new in the tech world.
use the buyback monies to buy an ai firm rather than build from scratch?
they already bought 36 ai companies.
and android phone have already ai - and in case of apple you have to wait year and buy a new phone
its kind of to late.....had apple poured there money into advanced ai they would have been in a better position. instead they poured alot of money into failed vr goggles that many ppl are not into.
"market reacting like apple blowing through cash for stock is the best thing ever, while the company itself is floundering, it's pulled out of electric vehicles and they have no future product lined up...

congrats to those who hold apple, no hate. to me, none of these are good signs though."
great man and your mom loves him
"they already bought 36 ai companies. more than any other company.
just be patient and wait what they come up with."
your research is lacking a lot of info  but hey we all can buy or sell what stocks we want. good luck
good news for $tsm taiwan semi!
if it were the end of the world i would want gene munster to explain to me what's going on
"may allah bless you all, welcome everyone please can you explain more to me honestly i really want to know more about this platform hope is helpful."
declining sales nobody cares because they said ai and buybacks
dan nathan is always hyperventilating in a negative way against the best us corporation……i have watched the show  for over 8 years and all mr. nathan do is to be always negative…..unbelievable!!! blessed
" agreed!  dan is 90% of the time soooo negative, even when things are going so great for a company. just a whiner and complainer."
"apple is the only major cell phone makers which doesn't have any ai included in its iphones!  even cheap communist chinese phones  all have ai functions.... that's right, almost forgotten... apple is going to ""copy"" chinese phone features again !!!!"
agentic ai?  total hype!
"please don't lie and pretend,  apple has nothing real in ai, only empty promises !!"
"since apple revenues declined -4.3%nsaqq, a reasonable benchmark might be to see if it can put a plus instead of a minus sign in front of that. and return to an old trendline of growth. to do that, it’s gonna have to come out with a new, innovative and beautiful piece of hardware. full disclosure: i sold about 40% of my position, but am still long."
aapl ai is not real....all growth will come from stock buyback.......not a growth stock anymore
100bln for share buyback but not ai spend? hell you can buy peloton and rivian and still have 90bln left over
 apple should be changing the world making humanoid robots advance ai persona trained on your own data etc.
"gene only comes on air when the stock is up 

starts praising that stock 

 you come before earnings and be right 

that day i’ll believe in you"
" thanks for the update! despite the economic recession, i no longer depend on government grants since i acquire $86,400 weekly profits."
great news! how did you get that?

"it's all thanks to ben ravikant.
​"
wow i know ben ravikant his platform maintains a unique perspective and is very transparent with their investors. regardless of whether or not he outperforms. i will forever stay invested!
wow i know ben ravikant his platform maintains a unique perspective and is very transparent with their investors. regardless of whether or not he outperforms. i will forever stay invested!
"​,  $47k from ben ravikant, looking up to acquire a new house, blessings "
"this sound so good and i would like to be a party to this, how can i contact your asset-coach?"
"after i raised upto 425k trading with him, i bought a new house here in the states also paid for my son's surgery (kelvin) glory to god"
"thanks alot good friend, i'll reach out to him ​"
his good reputation already speaks for him $ 110k last month
thanks for keeping it light and real at the same time.  much needed for us hodlers in times like these!
"!!my outlook on money changed when i realized someone making $300,000 can retire broke & someone making $80,000 can retire a multi-millionaire. with the current market movement, you have $100,000 to invest. where are you investing it?"
"i'm favoured financially, thank you jesus $32,000 weekly profit regardless of how bad it gets on the economy."
after i raised up to 325k trading with her i bought a new house and a car here in the states also paid for my son's surgery (oscar). glory to god.shalom..
"alright thanks for the recommendation, but how do i reach her?"
"trading without professional guide...huh i laugh you, because you will remain where you are or even make huge losses that will stop you from trading, this has been one of the biggest problem to new traders"
"so nice to see elizabeth michael talked about here,her good works are speaking already, and like wide fire she's spreading."
"zero substance around ai. ""growth"" stock has to increase buybacks and dividends to pump its stock price. clear market manipulation"
robot competition is coming
are these the ai robots that will go into deep space exploration??
"the whole ai industry is in shock!!

i mean, probably not from this but they just live in a constant state of shock everyday now and can no longer feel any other emotions"
 its a old robot sitcom series
this video sounds like a bad press release. no one wants a hype video with 0 substance. any proof of tge claims? how about we see one actually doing a real task outside of a laboratory environment . ither companies have actual humanoids in the workforce now not just in a lab.
thank you 
they will be cool when these don’t have to be pre programmed to do a task. but can do it on its own. basically you ask and learns by itself to figure it out as fast as some of us. i think it will happen finally in 3-4 months
boston dynamic has been in this industry for years and is not as advanced as this company claims. probably another bs to scam investors.
bd has a great marketing department. sanctuary ai is legit if you have been following this sector closely.
"people wakeup & stop being brainwashed & deceived!! dont support ai, robots, evs. brain chips etc.  its not for humanity! don't trust them!!! it's all a setup! spread awareness & take action!!"
aiai
good luck i think we are fked
"microsoft robot gets blue screen in the middle of a task, apple robot is missing hands will cost 3 times, and you have to pay extra for the hands. tesla robot gets turned off remotely for attempted repair. sun robot is slow as hell because it runs on java. "
"it also ironically sounds ai itself, despite claiming *_”humans like you and i”_* lol."
"ya, great idea.."
great work
did the ai generate the captions as well?
all i've seen so far is endless 1950s style panovision trailers for popular movies 
"openai: make a propaganda video about sora
sora: here 0:00"
this amazing but scary  this could put a whole bunch of people out of work
i hope all ai is destroyed
"yeah my friends, it was nice meeting you all"
i hate to say it...but i strongly believe ai is going to put us all asleep. we're done.
they should ban ai alreafy
"unsweetened tea
cole slaw 
green bean casserole - just so slimy and nasty 
coke zero … c’mon now"
where can i find this ai tool ?
wsj already preparing the ground for fake news and trying to derail trump.
"hi everybody!

you will be replaced soon enjoy the bugs"
"what if god is a really advanced ai that's generating this reality which would explain why ""he's everywhere"" and knows the answer to everything?"
cool video
this can ruin people's careers! people could upload an animation to youtube but they didn't make it. it's just some ai generated video.
"if you are interested in some valuable content completely made by ai tools, well... here i am {lol}"
"nothing, forever is going to get really great."
"ai animation should never have been worked on and improved it was all fun and games until eventually it’ll start taking over animators and artists jobs, hobbies and commissions"
we are waiting with excitement.
"let us brag about this. this is how they managed to make everyone turn against one another.  as cool as it is that they can do this.  it must be stopped.  it has been used as a weapon against americans and the world. dividing our country.
*together we stand.  *divided we fall."
1:00 that chair became sentient
this new technology(ai develepment in general) will force us to evaluate on ethics or it  will make us mental sick und twisted - more than ever before
"yeah, i really believe they ""won't use it for political campaigns,"" until one guy at the company gets millions of dollars worth of a bribe from certain politicians and throws any morals out the window."
flying chair
"seems like we are blurring the lines on reality and simulated reality. i think that’s sort of the point. if you want to take it that far, i could imagine that in the future ai + augmented reality could create an artificial universe simulated exactly like our own and generated endlessly."
it's crazier when you take in the fact that it's all exponential growth. this is all going way too fast. and you can't trust the old people in politics and corporate to adapt and do good things for the common people
the democratization of knowledge was one of the best things that happened to humanity. i hope ai's benefits outweigh its drawbacks.
be afraid. be very afraid.
the chair started walking on its own 
i mean if you show that to a person who doesn't know much about ai then they would say it's real footage but with cgi and editing
is sora ai not real
ai is getting out of control and dangerous
"this gives creative people the tools they need to create share their ideas.
lowering the barrier of entry and saving time, just like all other tools ever created by man.
smartphones allow everyone to be a ""photographer"".
ai will allow everyone to be anything they want."
"as scary as this is, im excited to see what sh** humanity can come up with"
a scary thing to see would be ais version of jesus crucifixion
"ai will write the best books, and produce movies of those books too .. within your lifetime (sooner than later)."
"i find the first real music video with ai sora here
 @salvatorecolor4492 "
"i already don't like it. some phones allow you to change photographs so that all the people in it are smiling etc. some people will obviously love that, but it's still fake.  i don't think it should be used in such areas and should be restricted to scientific and other forms of research. the abuse is too dangerous"
these are scary good
i remember back then- you would think how cool and sick things like this would be. but now that it's a real thing i'm truly just terrified. is it wrong to wish this never was possible?
wow
"ai is not art, nor should it be a tool, but it can be an inspirer, but it could be the demise of culture"
"this may kill people's interest in any kind of content. ai content will lack authenticity and soul, leading to viewer fatigue. simultaneously, real people's content may struggle to compete in terms of entertainment and creativity."
"bye bye art! soon musicians, artists, dancers etc will not be able to compete with ai"
i can't wait to see peter griffin eat chaos emeralds with saul goodman with the joker turning himself inside out
here we go lawnmower man movie becoming a reality where ai becomes self aware and uses generative ai text to video to manifest itself in videos. welcome to the ai apocalypse 
i think the misinformation ship set sail a long time ago
"trying to stay positive in the face of all the mal-uses that will occur, as a history teacher this will eventually be amazing to literally ""bring history to life"" for the kids."
"yep ,
as predicted, well now there won't be much use of humans.
apart from approving of things as final product (to check if ai worked correctly).
wonder what will 3bil working population of the world do in few years."
nice
i've been indirectly killed these ai companies.
i've been indirectly killed by ai
"""ai is going to change the world!""

ai: 0:56"
"man, imagine an ai can make whole movie just with a script..
that would be amazing."
go ahead you have no limits with this wonderful gift from the minds of the genius
grant_wisler made a joke about using ai to get away with crime only for that to become a prediction
"now you know that out of all the centuries you could have been born in, you were born in the one just before the dawn of ai"
just put copyrights on it and watch open ai go down
copyright slap it and enjoy
will smith ai
"this is amazing, beautiful and creepy! human can make everything that imagine. can even enable technology to do anything, so we must be careful with this. but we shouldn't stop technological and scientific development, it's magnificent."
all ai videos should have a legal requirement to be watermarked to identify if its ai generated or not.
i swear that chair video was uncanny 
"i also think that ai could be a huge 'shock to the system' in many ways (meaning society, the economic system, culture, etc.). nostalgia for the 2010s is likely about to take off as well."
yeah thats true my opinion is that this most likely is not going to be able to be stopped because of how ai grows so we are def going to have to prepare
games could potentially be made purely with ai in future and i mean like if you look at a city with your mouse or controller it will create a fast responsive video of your perspective looking at a really really realistic city everyone in your perspective will look real so real you'd not be able to tell if it's ai or an actual video 
ai movie coming soon
im really waiting for this one 
time to get right with god by trusting in his only begotten son jesus christ who is the only perfect righteousness required to enter heaven.
"incredible, maybe we are just five or six years away from having a ai takeover"
this actually needs to be banned at some point. as cool as it is there's absolutely no way the creative industry will survive at the rate these are advancing
" same thing happening with me the ai can also make music...but we still have the experienced artist perspective..so i think we are good right ? 
just tell ""yeah you are right """
every f...n movie about ai has ended badly for humanity and yet forward head first we go.
next 5 years ai will be something else
"i can just see all movies and tv shows being replaced with a one subscription thing, where you can just say ""i want to watch an adventure movie staring x x x with x theme and x plot"" mid way thru you dont like the direction you rewind and get ai to edited the films orientation."
dumb ai needs a law where it needs a watermark stating it’s ai not human made.
"ok so basically the inception of the actual matrix? cool, cool..."
"i do not understand why people scared ai so much. actually it is very limited. some random combination. people going to get bored soon. art is from human. ai will not be able to say anything for us, about us,  from us  it will follow the attention will try to get attention . capitalistic toy"
"the only good thing about this digital apocalypse is that no social network will be threatening people's selfsteem anymore...i mean, more than never, what's the point of watching things that nobody will believe it's real anymore...   it's about time!"
"a partir de agora, será mais difícil distinguir a verdade da mentira, o real do digital. em breve veremos o declínio da nossa sociedade."
cant wait to be sentenced for a crime that an ai did of me... society's  dead isnt it
the chair is moving itself
can't wait to create the minecraft movie with this before it gets released.
"imagine the endless possibilities with this hollywood is in trouble people are gonna make video games into movies. books, comics, anime existing movies will get prequels and sequels. scripts that never got used in hollywood people will use them and create interesting things."
"awesome content by wsj news. very educative and following the tips will help you a great deal. i have related content on my channel. coding, graphic design and everything ai. if this sounds like something you're interested in pass by."
"in a way it’s actually great. we never had videos at all until just 150 years ago or so. the influential videos have on us, and digital information in general, is too high. now with this in the wild we will need other ways to communicate."
it was a good run people. there goes my job.
please delete the ai ​​it is the beginning of a dark time
"all fun games until you realize that ai is destroying artists, destroying the movie industry and destroying animators."
" they cant keep doing things if they dont make money, they will instead need to switch jobs and it will prb end up ending there love for what there doing"
"this is really impressive. however, nothing would ever beat the complexity of an enlightened human soul. what we can imagine, how we communicate, and where we can travel by our souls .. this is beyond ai reach!"
"wrong. what we imagine is directly proportional to what data you have in your brain. 
secondly, soul is fictional."
this combination is perfect: apple vision pro (similar or improved) + a.i. (creation of a world) + time dilation (an a.i. in itself that makes you a virtual world and that every second in real life is a year in this world virtual and that only 1 second passes physically for us) = eternal life
are you trying to become a robot or something ?
"why do we feel the need to create something that can do exactly what humans can but just worse? not only does it have the possibility of stealing jobs but if used in a bad manner can cause real harm to people in other ways too (for example pornography, which people already make of totally random people using ai generated images)"
looks good!
"even tho this looks really good, it just feels off, like there’s no proper death perception. it just looks like there’s no depth to this videos."
"hollywood: with chat gtp, we no longer need writers, deepfake no longer needs actors and midjourney we no longer needs publicists, ha ha!!
with sora we no longer need filmmakers nor studios.
hollywood: no, no, wait!!! let's talk this out!!"
cant wait till we just revert to being farmers
"contradiction of capitalism 101. if your innovations lead to massive layoffs, then whose going to be able to buy your products? especially in an unregulated market like america. lets imagine that this wipes out untold jobs along with automation in other industries. alongside supressing wages  good luck selling anything."
"i was thinking the same, especially the chair in the sand scene, it looks like how my dreams transition from scene to scene."
 human brain is nothing like that
this is just the beginning. what we have seen from ai is just the first grains of a coming mountain.
​-dt1uqit both fascinates me also scares me
ai…ai
"maybe they should really make it hard to generate prompts by limiting celebrity names, political figures, promiscuous terms and similar themes to prevent misuse. i’m sure there will be workarounds but i’d think updates will help to fix problems, that’s the best i can think of. also maybe watermarks would help"
the future is here! soraai
there were time when cgi was  but now this ai beast sora taking over entire humanity to next euphoria.
ms has banned sora's use for political campaign purposes. to do so would be considered very naughty. so that's a relief.
"officer i didn’t shoot and kill those two children, it’s ai generated"
"before, only the chosen ones could bring great film projects to life. hollywood and its ivory towers dictated the rules. but now, with sora, everyone has access. from a student's room to a dreamer's cafeteria, everyone can create. poverty and lack of support are no longer barriers."
no person will use this for good
ai
this isn’t a good idea
the new wave of artists are now the people that come up with the best ideas/prompts
slasher movies will be super realistic soon.
mind blown....cannot wait to play next gen ai games
"ai has already effectively replaced concept artists. it's a fantastic tool for indie developers in that regard.
can also by used by independent filmmakers for storyboarding and visual aid for shot conceptualization, composition etc."
" oh i guess that's another good use of ai, as long as it doesn't completely replace human creativity"
"​

humans still have to use the ai... if i tell it to generate a video of joe biden boxing donald trump, it's still being directed by humans."
this will be the most deadly weapon 10 years later just imagine someone made about a guy bomb an embassy by just using ai generated video (could lead to nuclear war)i am just saying  if this ai thing gose viral the world will change and never be the same 
"i dont understand why everyone is so scared of ai videos, like if someone makes a ideo about you making a some kind of a crime, watermarks exist? and rules?"
which ai this is
imagine getting in prison for 50 years because someone has faked a video of you using ai.
the same could be said about any job. ai will come for all jobs in the coming years.
" not really
artists, influencers and all major corporate owners and top employees will still remain"
 ai will never be able to compete with human ingenuity
"great, so now we won't even know if travel videos are actually of real places."
of all the areas to make ourselves obsolete and superfluous in we choose culture and art. absolutely tragic.
0:50 i liked when the chair started to ascend into 4d
"its an image generation ai, not terminator"
all i see is endless potential and a revolutionary shift in the entertainment industry and likely most other industries.
"*how about we make propagandas, defamations, and slanders with this?, wow so dark isn't it?*"
"claim your ""here before it destroys the world"" ticket here"
"unironically what good could come out of this other than misinformation
the company banning the technology from political campaigns wont do literally anything 
the ""films"" that'll come out of this will be utterly soulless and i dont know how more people arent realizing that"
entertainment industry 
the chair video is what it feels like to do ketamine
some theorize this is just the basic level tech they’re showing us and what they have in secret is light years more advanced. it’s extremely naive to believe they’ll reveal their best.
hollywood's scripts are probably already written by ai
"they won't be, cuz people still loves to watch artist, real persons so many are fans not just for art but for also artist persona, probably real treat is for anime graphic creators."
company acknowledges the technology’s potential harm for political reasons. company continues to develop said technology instead of abiding by the consensus of a world wide halt on ai development. the world is f***ed.
"yeah we defiantly aren’t prepared for ai. i feel like soon our world is going to change faster than we think. in theory, it can be good. i just worry it will be misused."
75% of new content will be ai generated by 2025
"""it has banned the use of its technology for political campaigning"" 
ok but important question, what about porn"
"
ai needs to completely banned.
to many liar's and control freak's will use it to destroy our world."
"artists sweating bricks and deciding this is immoral and will never (shouldn't ever) replace real art...

crazy, i don't remember the art industry being up in arms during the 70's - 80's when factory workers were losing jobs every day to robotics and automation. "
"what is real? how do you define 'real'? if you're talking about what you can feel, what you can smell, what you can taste and see, then 'real' is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain."
great..
"the ai generated images and videos are dangerous to the brain, specially to children, because it does harm to the cognitive development. this is really dangerous, and need proper scientific study and legislation. if you have access to researches, psychologists, neurologists, or legislators, please help make people aware of this danger."
the rise of the machines will be much worse than the f....g terminator
we are all doomed and i love it
 to the brain? 
amazing
​ are already altering images and videos in highly believable ways even before ai. this changes nothing lol.
"  the ai generated images are completely different from anything made before, they have lots of unnatural and subliminal movements and ""noise"", like people or objects moving in impossible ways, and interframe objects and positioning. you need to have a little knowledge on the subject to understand, this is a serious issue."
and yet entertainment of the future will be astounding. i can only imagine.. imagine telling an ai to let you play whatever you want. like literally describe to an ai what you want to play as a video game and it becomes the game you play.
"this is some top-notch content. i read a book with a similar topic, and it was absolutely incredible. ""game theory and the pursuit of algorithmic fairness"" by jack frostwell"
i want to make a whole movie with this ai.
 that does sound like a fair positive. i hope you have fun with that.
" i would say movies exist to entertain people. if they are willing to pay for their own entertainment, why does it matter where the movie originates from? i think the biggest positive from this is entertainment in general actually."
"the speed of ai evolution is crazy   q couple months after, the ai creation video was trash, and now this..."
"were not 'cooked,' you're incredibly pessimistic"
 you're incredibly optimistic if you think that this won't be abused into oblivion 
 you're incredibly pessimistic if you think that this won't be regulated into oblivion
" people will find workarounds, ai is already being abused, but now it will be in video form. it is a cause for concern"
"’re incredibly optimistic that this won’t affect the workforce, creating a new surge of unemployment rates"
"no!  i want a video with vladimir putin in his kremlin office saying ""i am an ai construction.  vote t*ump."""
finally i can watch all of those novels i love ;)
soros loves sora
tell ai to generate some employments and little bit of cash for me
"basically, in a few years, everyone in the movie industry gonna be out of jobs. movie studios will only need writers to create scripts to feed the ai."
ai can write the sript itself too buddy
there will no longer be a movie industry. it’ll just be ai independent from any human intervention
"all fun in games until someone's in court and they show an ai generated video of them committing a crime they never did

edit: why did this comment get 93 likes it's stupid"
" i did, that's cool "
the defendant can simply point out that it's ai-generated because it lacks a paper trail.
you can see it in the metadata if it was made with ai or an actual video recorder
there will be ai experts to get whether it's fake or maybe openai can have a secret code in every video which could be used to detect whether it's fake or real
", thanks though"
.97 imagine ww3 because of an ai video
"​-sp9tuironically, ai is creating more job for people lol."
"-sp9tu we'll see i guess. as of today the only pieces of media i see using ai art are mobile games nobody plays, or art you view for free on the internet. things like games, comic and movies are still very much human-made."
​ i can walk naked on street and when they will take a pic i will say its ai
least braindead anti-ai propaganda. openai backs up any prompt and output their ais make.
this is equally incredible and terrifying at the same time due to the countless implications of this tech. almost like looking at footage from alternate universes and realities.
i literally can’t think of single good thing that will come from this…
one good thing is you can basically travel back in time with this tech with the realism it has like if you were actually there.
" machine learning is limited by existing datasets, so that isn’t really possible"
 you confused between artificial and reality.
just ask sora to generate a video explaining what good things can arise from this
" no, it's still fake. it is a toy. there is no value to this past entertainment and manipulation."
 why is that good?
" cause it would make life in space or other planets tolerable for one, but mainly you can experience any fantasy you want without wearing equipment"
one of good things i could think of is you can make fake war footage from ww2 or something for those alt history videos. but that also means you might be able to make fake war footage from modern wars like ukraine or israel
⁠ not really a good thing. you could fake historical events that never happened which could be bad
one good thing is that you can write a script for a movie and get it made without being limited by not having enough money and possibly make millions.. thats one good thing. lol
you can ask ai for a video of a gorrila vs mike tyson
create any movie video game or animation you want with prompt = infinite entertainment of exactly what you want.
how about living on mars without internet access and being able to generate your own endless entertainment?
"entertainment, new jobs with ai, simplification of tedious tasks in existing jobs, etc. ai is a tool, people will use it for good and bad."
can’t wait to see gpt5
imagine making a multimillion dollar looking film alone  over a weekend.   this is becoming scary good.
"​ well now, we will have ai movie stars"
"they certainly used to, but the very notion of a movie stars has faded pretty dramatically in my lifetime. so i'd not lay to much hope on that saving the traditional movie industry against this onslaught."
the video game industry is valued more than twice than the movie industry and we have plenty of non movie stars. we dont need overpaid actors. 
"my friends did back in the days. they shot it in a rent apartment and ai wasn't even there yet. movie is called ""star wreck"" (2005) and 4 million people saw it, budget was just 15.000€. you can watch it on youtube, english subtitles."
"​@badpuppy3 wait until you can down load those star images and voices.  
can already licenses james earl jones i beleive."
"imagine making a star wars sequel that doesn't suck, or the nicolas cage superman movie with a few strokes of a keyboard."
"what the cell phone has done to social circles, ai will do the same to imagination."
say hello to 'sora': openai's game-changing text-to-video marvel!       https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ntnqeyuuk7w
"that's why the world doesn't improve, instead of thinking about the thousands of good possibilities, people only think about the negative possibilities"
it should be has generic version that available for low income people
"nice job, people.

from now on, i wont believe any video unless i see it myself."
incredible technology. now every creative person will have the chance to create quality art.
everything can be used for good and bad. if it is used by bad people. it will erase the line between the real and the fake.
"goodbye, history. hello, whatever the current government wants you to believe was history."
ah sweet man-made horrors beyond my comprehension
thanks i hate it
"this is midkey terrifying...
ai images were one thing, but videos?
this isn't gonna be good..."
this technology only has downsides and a future where entertainment is all ai generated is really depressing.
"it only has downsides if you benefited from the high barrier to entry. 

for everyone else it makes entertainment creation easy enough for them to enter and make content"
"i'm sure people who lived during the industrial revolution said ""a future where commodities are created in a factory you've never even seen is really depressing"". i can't think of how a future where entertainment is both higher quality and easier to produce is entirely bad for us as a whole."
".i... in china the politicians, didn’t failed to act"
" judging by your name and allegiance you are an ai, and should not be taken seriously"
" sure dude, coz i have a number in my name? i guess half of youtube users  are ai bots then for years already, including the op. you shouldn't worry too much about artificial intelligence, worry about your own intelligence"
"​@leirbag6367  because the entire point of capitalism is to undercut the ""other guy"". this technology will ruin innocent lives and destroy business. the first to use it will win whether they shouldn't not. don't get me wrong i think this is great if used properly but in the wrong hands it's very bad."
good luck enforcing that
"​say goodbye to your profession 
in future photographer would probably only approve the photo's as ai can never be perfect in doing that , there will always be a bug or something."
"crazy how humans made another ""world"" of artificial intelligence, which is scary to think about, like they can turn at us at any time. when is giving their mindset and they develop feeling and touch. i may be crazy guys"
"how much energy is needed to make a one min video like this? if everyone did this, perhaps a good chunk of energy consumption would just be this."
"as a history buff, and gold prospector, the gold rush video is incredible to watch. only problem is, this isn't true ai...it's just a search engine that is following commands given to it by a user, and it accesses everything humanity has uploaded to the internet... no autonomy whatsoever."
looks pretty artificially intelligent to me
that drone footage of california during the gold rush it incredible! its like sending a drone back in time and watching the footage!
"but if you watch closely, there are some horses that lack one pair of their four legs, it looks unnerving, they look like aliens."
 can be fixed with video inpainting just like image inpainting for dalle.
it's not available to the public and probably won't be until after the election.
pretty sure the ai looks at the prompt
i think the misinformation ship set sail a long time ago
​ sure people willing to spread misinformation wouldn't care much about the tos of an ai.
they just seeing which side takes the bait
"inly the government can have ai
we, the people, will, ofc, use it to spread disinformation, misinformation, malicious lies, missoginy, bullying and on and on and on.
we cannot trust so so we decide the truth.
do not agree? your bankaccount is closed."
"when you see these video's getting more and more realistic how can you not see where things are headed. not to long from now all the streaming apps like netflix, disney, paramount etc. will all train ai on their video data and create a practically unlimited amount of new movies, shows, animations, cartoons, anime..."
"umm, we'll be doing it ourselves. dont think there wont be open source models given to the public for free. cant be stopped. just need good enough hardware to run it"
and it'll be great tbh
pretty soon all adult videos (av) will be ai videos (av).
"this is cool! i firmly believe people want to see content made by real humans however so have optimism, people!"
"i'm so excited for its potential to become a weapon of the future, and hopefully even today."
could be misused but look what the media does anyway. night was well just be able to make what ever and put a watermark on the corner and everyone’s happy no trickery. imagine the movies people could make who can’t afford or figure out how to produce something. just got good ideas
nice comment from somebody on the internet watching on their mobile device. 
"nope. i would rather have ai will smith eating spaghetti pasta, thank you"
fascinating but indeed extremely dangerous! and they know it… in near future we all will have even more scruples to believe what we see on visual medias.
both fascinating and scary...
is that 3kliksphillip in the thumbnail? :p
non-human intelligence tech for example from crash retrievals? 
about time we had access to renewable resources thru ai
and good riddance 
​ will still buy your stock if it looks nice.
so you ask an ai to create footage from a town in california during the gold rush and it makes it by recording it from the air years before the plane was invented ?
if you think life is blurred then you haven't felt the amazing touch of a women or the smell of her hair. the stink of her breath in the morning. you got some reaal issues. my girlfriend is incredible.. her flesh is just unique only rivaled perhaps by another human and never pixels or a robot.
they’ve been blurred for years already. so many idiots online fall for poorly photoshopped photos. and that was long before ai.
0:54 scp has breached containment
"the old west output is good, but the buildings have many flaws. the model needs to be taught how interior design should match exterior design. the model is showing more a tone than what an actual west village would look like. i currently train ai and understand a bit of it's current limitations."
it will unlock a ton of options we haven't even imagined yet. and that's with version 1 of sora. what sora 2 or 5 or 10 looks like will surely completely revolutionize the way everything is done. it's exciting and scary and fascinating and absolutely mind blowing to imagine this future.
"if it’s “sticky“.

it could be the most incredible technology in the world but if it doesn’t stick; if people don’t adopt it it won’t go past being a cool tool. 

all the social medias today could also have ended up at the bottom page of the app store’s if no one bought it to it."
look back like 3-4 years ago and ai coudnt even made proper cat image and now look at this cant imagine what will be next in 5 years
"as an artist i feel this technology as a possible threat to creativity and imagination of any artist; any user could create imagery through a sort of menu. on the other hand, as a picture enthusiast, this videos (like the one of gold rush) may be great for scientific and educational porpuses."
"ai is not doing the prompting so its only helping people be creative, not limiting it. you dont have to spend decades in learning how to manually recreate the ideas you have in your mind, you can just write the prompt for it, the script and let the ai do the manual labor"
"whats the point. if its about the process, nobody is stopping you from doing art. but if you want the final result, you can also have that. ai brings freedom."
"​ perfectly said. and during this artpiece, we put our own personal experiences, emotions, and perspective to literally anything we make. people always make the argument that ""you don't need to spend so much time learning how to draw/animate/..."" when that is one of the major aspects of doing art is learning."
" yeah it's honestly quite sad how one of the first things humanity has done with advancements in ai is to replace creatives and attempt to ""automate"" art."
"""videos (like the one of gold rush) may be great for scientific and educational purposes""
if we say dinosaurs are green like lizards, then ai will generate a ""scientific document"" in which dinosaurs are green. 
if we say the medieval world was like the witcher, ai will generate materials that could be used in school."
"​ exactly, generative ai won't always be accurate especially when it comes making images or video (textual information is a different story). using ai generated images in something like a textbook in my opinion is just wrong, unless you are using it specifically to show how genai works."
"that is the point of this program...to destroy creativity. it's happened throughout mankind's history, usually through force, brutality, or social engineering...this is just our current version. the future has dark times ahead, i'm afraid."
​ as an artist feel this will take creativity to new levels and execute even greater ideas this is objectuvely great and will help creativity and art.
"this is the death of any educational value in a video. any and all historical videos will have a 50/50 chance of being entirely fabricated by an ai, and hence worthless to learn from. the general public won't know this, though, so history will be erased/overwritten. this is insane."
"you're right, however, i feel like this will just increase the value of actual physical art made by a human hand. like a drawing or painting on a canvas"
 that´s a good point. like the contrast between industry and handcraft. it would be a great cultural mindset.
"​

""you don't seem to be an artist..."" 

this is why nobody cares that you guys are losing your jobs. 
everyone else wants the end product to express themselves.  if you guys just like the process of making the art, ai isn't stopping you."
" speak for yourself, if you want to create content, you will definitely be able to do it faster with ai soon. but it will never be called art. and i think what the world needs least of all is more content creators - but maybe that's just me."
" 

sure, it's already called ai art and people are moving towards it and away from you guys so it doesn't bother me"
 open the window and get some air ai stan
beautiful thanks for the high quality edit and excellent portrayal of todays news
cant wait to see taylor swift videos gonna be crazy lol
"and when people started selling premade photos, videos, graphic elements , website layouts , they ruined business for other people, but they didn't think twice.it's good for some , bad for others, and it's how we push things into the future ."
"​@guitar333
if you can pick on a cherry or any fruit from a tree and put it in your mouth, you will survive.

ai can't stop you from doing that.
why y'all afraid of ai "
worst part is that if your work was public then it may have been used to train the model without a licence or your consent.
"people theorize that a lot of this footage was trained on shutterstock's database, who are partners with this ai company"
-bb6dn we want jobs to live a healthy life with no source of income is very diffuicult unless you already had some money saved up a lot of the creative types are gonna lose there jobs and ai is coming for other jobs too  including the software people were kinda cooked
" i think it might take a bit longer for the economic side effects to catch up, but in the next recession, ai will be a leading cause of unemployment."
"there will still be a demand for ""authentic"" stock footage, mainly from weird wealthy people. i wouldn't delete it."
"i wanted to learn 3d rendering and stuff and make cool 3d animation this year, not anymore i guess"
" you still can dude. you can do it as a hobby. don't let automation kill your passion. we have massive industry that produces furniture, yet my dad is still a woodworker because he loves doing it. do not lose your passion."
learn to code and you will work in the industry the makes ai generated movies! someone most decide what is a good movie!
" doubt that coding will save you, ai can already code"
" i know ... but in the end someone must use the software. some because cod skills will be helpful.
i think an person with artistic skills and some basic coding will succeed.
i think that mediocre software developers will be first replaced by ai. faster than artists."
soon it's everything that doesn't require manual labour although that might also be replaced by robots.
open ai probably used it to train its plagiarism ai
" ai will take quite some time to be able to code like a human can do. most high-skill careers are secure, for now."
all of entertainment is doomed
"the ai generated images and videos are dangerous to the brain, specially to children, because it does harm to the cognitive development. this is really dangerous, and need proper scientific study and legislation. if you have access to researches, psychologists, neurologists, or legislators, please help make people aware of this danger."
coding is still a valuable skill you can't use ai for sophisticated algorithms where billions of dollars or lives are at stake even if a model could you would still want someone to double or triple check it then there is the task of keeping it up to date.
" you know that ai can code, right?"
 not everyone can code. some brains are different.
they might have even trained sora on your stock material lol
​ to use ai yourself. itll save ur job
" it isn't a blow, it is a opportunity. 
ai is a tool that will make us more productive. 
we must just  learn to use it!"
​ it doesn't matter. ai will replace that skill as well.
"not really. if u have some kind of proof that it's not ai, like a dated credentials then it's still useful."
"just adapt, nothing is eternal. ai is even bigger invention than internet, you will see."
​ the one who uses the ai best gets the job.
" yeah, but it wasn't ruined by a robot and a single sentence"
 what is a camera to an oil portrait painter ? especially digital cameras.a push of a button.
"well, your footage will are probably in the train data of the ai model, so they will use part of your footage and you won't get a dune."
 the lord my job would be impossible with ai.
"​ what code can you pls explain what is that? i wanted to learn anime learning in blender and found ai, i will still learn anime  but i do want to be updated with ai"
"might as well throw your money into a nearby drain. ""a.i."" is a colossally inflated bubble at the moment."
"i believe you can only invest indirectly through purchasing msft and infy stocks. the other owners are private equity groups, venture capitalists, and individual company founders. look up openai on wikipedia — it has ownership info."
" meh all i hear is an awkward ai impersonation, nothing new, just chuck all jh production in a blender and you come up with something that resembles it, yeah, but it's not a great song. when ai can create a new ""voodoo child"", or a new beatles'""a day in the life"" then i'll be impressed. it won't be easy"
maybe not live performance. at least not yet. a lot of fans love their favorite artist not because of their music but their personality and person as a whole. but aspiring new artists will definitely suffer.
"the only question is...why fake it..? why ruin music...?  it's time to stop, i will personally boycott ai music hard, even if it is the best thing ever."
the ceo of open ai confirmed they are going to launch open ai publicly after taking all safety measures .
you can say that for literally anything. anything resourceful can be used for both good and evil.
"the first comment i see is this, i love you man ."
people will gate this comment but i love 
it's openai. that prompt will be blocked just for having his name in it.
sweet burn
"​ difference is actually hitler have a ""liked"" jews (since they work in hitler's liking), while natenyahu openly claim he wants all dead in a video."
would love that
best idea ever
"considering this is openai and dall-e is already very restricted on stuff relating to hitler, it wouldn't go through"
watch love death robots they did a episode on that
nain!!!!!!!!
"if you are good at what you do, you know tons about it. just lern prompting and you´ll be ahead of volks who never edited before. and think pink ;)"
nah man not quite yet. most of these ai videos lack nuance.
are you kidding? with more video footage available there will be even more need for video editors
​. it'll advance so far that you won't need to do anything to it. or the edits can be made by the ai.
"ai is a wonderful invention , but can be disastrous if not regulated . it should be banned for political and social messages and used only in the sectors of agriculture and healthcare ."
regulations can be implemented but there will always be people that will find ways around it. this is gonna open an ai black market
this is the next great step into future technology....that will write history
i've been waiting for a pop in the stock because of sora. folks are asleep
multi billion dollar corporations are currently in a ai arms race what are u talking about? lol
" lol, not even a good question. yeah we didn't ask for them to have this race. we will however spend our money on consuming what they make from it. it's just human nature."
"​ clear it up for you then. i'm excited for this, and very much want this. if you bother to do major research into ai, you would agree. things will change yes, but things always change. people freak out when any new tech comes along, line will get better, we will survive."
"watch us go back to the middle-age. we will have to recreat an alternative human society, from food to housing etc.
let mr altman, gates, etc. enjoy their new society where we are all out of jobs and they are trillionaires."
wonder if the public/media/police can distinguish between real phones/videos and ai generated ones. like if an alleged crime or political scandal happened with photo/video evidence.
"it would be easy for the ai to create an individual hash for each photo or video created, so you could just look up a video or photo and determine if the ai created it. given that openai would implement that feature"
they probably won't launch it to the public in general because of that...must be training law enforcement with counter ai tools...or so i would like to believe
use ai to distinguish ai
" 
the problem is space. do u know how many terabyte and servers u need to store and archive them? every second a new ai content is being created."
"ai: ""hey silicone valley artists, now your services are precindible. good bye dye."""
unfortunately openai won’t let you do it due to copyright issue
marvel vs dc mashup or garbage pail kids vs stinkblasters!
"sora open ai is going to displace so many jobs like drone operators, 3d animators and videographers. how to survive this?"
" did you check sora? it can create almost any type of video just with a couple of words. so, i don't see a reason not to replace videographers as well. that's a pain too!!"
"​@theaigal  it is a bit more complicated than this, but it sure will have a very big impact on the industry. but we as human will have to decide if we go back to medieval times as serf and our kings/masters with the likes of altman and gates."
workin on it now give me a couple months yall shall know of jakoai
incredible video
i feel like using ai for marketing perfect ways to hack humans to buy stuff... is hella abusive and should be curtailed.
"boring video - it's more exciting to  search for ""ai in marketing"" on google scholar and i even know 5x more"
"great video, so powerful"
ai is the new era!
seeing the same advertisements and content on social media in a bigger amount and sounding the same is a real threat. very insightful. thank you!
"loved your thoughts on ai-driven marketing, jessica. if you are aiming for a sequel, please do consider mystrika. it is a cold email tool, but oh boy, it is way more than that. the a/b testing and detailed analytics have transformed my campaigns. a video on it would truly be enriching!"
"great points made in this video, jessica! however, i would love if you could do an episode on mystrika someday. it is a cold email tool i have been using, and damn, it is amazing! their email warmup feature is top-notch and the inbox rotation option is unique. count me as a fan!"
"""comming up by the perfect product"" . ye right , marketers came up with it and not the engineers or designers! actualy more like stoled the idea and send it to china to be made by forced labers and then paketed the profit."
this is someone who's job sector is facing extinction along with many others... ai will not be persuaded by charisma...
"notes:
use ai to create useful ads.
clear and direct. like a trade offer.
you get x (a great slam offer) 
in exchange for y (including all costs).
make the ads pleasant to the senses.
make the ads relevant."
"thankfully, management will be the last domino to fall"
so i'm a left brain ai marketer. what courses should i take or what's my next step?
"incredible! this is a masterpiece of content. i recently read a similar book, and it was an unforgettable experience. ""game theory and the pursuit of algorithmic fairness"" by jack frostwell"
"bill hick's opinion on marketers was right. internet was great when it was my friends posting stuff without concern of it being an advertisement. now all i see on social media, even from my friends, ads. all ads. so i don't use it much anymore. if i do i'm hyper aware i'm opening my advertisement viewing apps."
exactly what i was looking forward to. thanks for the amazing insights.
"hello, excellent reflexion. right now, i am doing my doctoral studies in marketing and i have an excellent point of view that i agree with you, despite i have my master's degree in digital technologies."
i am also doing my doctoral studies in marketing. what is your research topic? i'm exploring generative ai in advertising's influence on purchase intention
"think out of the box, ai is limited with brand self data and bricks."
verry good
discover the best website builders of 2024 
"i do hope a concept of counter/anti marketing tools will be introduced with the advent of ai as well. something like antimarketing, similar to antivirus or noise cancelling,."
"cultivate ai and you'll have a superpower
it's sound good enough"
who can share the bcg hbs ai x marketing study she refers to?
"ai can help identify trends based on historical patterns, but human decisions and creative aspects are often still required for new ideas and innovation. the use of ai in data analysis can provide valuable insights, but humans still have a key role in developing new ideas and facing emerging challenges in the future."
"it's not like boom agi, it's more like boom boom bo boom bo bom bo boom bo bo bo bo boom a g i 

so during that time we can use ai as a tool until we can't or we don't have to"
marketing has tried its best to ruin the internet and society in general.
were toast. society is ruined that too many people like generative ai. another mental health issue. the internet is a dumpster fire 
"perhaps marketers should start by taking ownership of how their work has blindsided consumers from the various social ills that have been inflicted by their bosses, and think about how that supercharged productivity will simply allow them to mislead consumers and governments at scale. ."
"i'm am about a week into the ai algorithm feed on youtube - i'm hearing a lot of the use of the words ""predictive"" and ""model"" ------------- so my question is ---- ---- why aren't weather forecasts for the weekend or next week super accurate now? if the answer is ""garbage in - garbage out"" then not much has changed."
i'm so glad that she's trying to save marketing.....
ai will accomplish the same thing that robotics did. it will put people out of work. back in the 60s they all lauded the easier lives we would have by benefiting from new production technology. they were wrong then and they are still wrong now. “those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.”
"it actually was helpful, thanks"
thanks
amazing :) thanks
"very helpful indeed!

could ai have delivered her message?

could ai have provided the summary you presented?"
thanks!
"bro, thank you so much ! a hug from brazil "
thank you
"bro your comment is gold, thanks for saving so many people. i too struggled to fully grasp her point"
incredible video
are we still talking about right-brain and left-brain in 2023?
it's so super amazing most likely this ted! 
" hahaha... wow, talk about 2 months late to the comment section, redundant and maladroit. brilliant. :d"
" don’t know the first thing about seo, ppc ad campaign creation or management, email newsletter copywriting, creating effective product descriptions or graphic design tools or principles of any sorts. this is like comparing hr to financial. completely different."
"i hate advertisements, always have and likely always will. i hate when someone attempts to convince me to buy something i don't need for a price that is unreasonable.
everything this lady says in the first 5 minutes sounds like a fucking nightmare to me. yet she says it with such enthusiasm and zeal like that projected future is a good thing??"
ai marketing is revolutionizing the way businesses connect with their audience. the data-driven insights and personalized experiences it enables are game-changers in today's dynamic digital landscape. exciting times ahead for marketers embracing the power of ai!
comment written by ai lol
"quite vague and pretentious, could have definitely used some inspiring best practice examples."
"i don’t fully agree with the content of that video. 
new ai tools are able to create contents with complete new ideas
so idk about the future of people working as marketers"
"as much as i appreciate information, i feel bad towards other academic sources that isn't a i.  

ted really follows that algorithm to a tee !"
"it's obvious that they're trying to sell out the idea of ai, seeing how ai related topics are plastered all over their recent videos tbh"
"bold of her to assume that ai will not straight up replace marketing people alltogether. i very much doubt that ai will fail at creativity. 

this felt so vague and like a business meeting with a boss who just throws keywords around."
another bs in ai: we have every data in the whole world about everything
​ the best way to predict future behavior is by looking at past behavior... we're fucked
"marketing is bs, it to maintain superfluous ppl within busy work"
we need to ditch the dichotomies and focus on continuums. my brain is both 'left' and 'right'.
"short term linear narrow visión.  i bet for how irrelevant marketing could be with no sustainable goods and even services.
services: meaning, society  not even reach the rate of childs necessary to keep on that market."
"what impacts me the most it is what she has told about, our ideas being the core of ai. so, there is time to keep creating, for more to be generated.  loving it "
"you assume we all want more time off, i don't,  i need money to pay bills. are you covering my mortgage and school loans with your great leisure plans? i think not."
"ai and robotics may be cost effective, however if more and more people lose jobs.....who will be able to buy products? bread lines of the great depression are looming."
"i think everyone need own a ai robots and make it work instead of human.
so everyone can get and ues money that robots earn"
cool
i fundamentally disagree with this conception of left and right brains. u don't need to be left brained to do math word problems and not right brain to realise women buy purses more than men
ai is most dangerous as a propaganda tool. it can destroy our ability to tell fact from fiction
"nice ted talk ... meanwhile in reality for most companies, marketing is still the same sales-oriented and lying producing department, responsible for promoting imaginary products, that are completely disconnected from the reality of the production departments and the terms and conditions of delivering the product."
marketing was a waste of human talent anyways so good riddance...
"in the constant search for greater efficiency, quality of life diminishes and people are just seen as ""consumers"". sad."
my brain is blocking all advertisements and marketing i stopped watching this video halfway. to much content to consume  next.
ai gang gang
the main point to your thesis is not clear. you're suggesting that the subject she's talking about is going to be incredibly impactful - but then you mentioned that she lives in a fantasy land. she's highlighting the machine - human interaction and you're only highlighting one side of it. why?
of course. comparing ai tools to productivity tools as word processing and spreadsheet is a joke 
"it's not like boom agi, it's more like boom boom bo boom bo bom bo boom bo bo bo bo boom a g i 

so during that time we can use ai as a tool until we can't or we don't have to"
you're all living in fairyland if you don't understand that the real threat to social cohesion is not artificial intelligence but those who are manipulating and attempting to socially engineer society via advertising right now.
ai will continue to stay relevant for thousands more years. i guess humans are no longer needed for marketing.
wow
"""never send a human to do a machine's job"" "
"i'm ready for my ai agent to take over mundane tasks, like deciding which netflix show to binge."
will ai agents help me choose my next tiktok dance challenge?

"if ai agents can fold my laundry, i'm all in!"

tony stark was like the richest person in the world. that’s a great avatar of who will benefit most from ai.
i think narrow ai will be a net positive and generative ai is probably a net negative for humankind.
"i'm hard on hearing, thank you for the lowest volumed youtube video ever!"
"who ever edited this video is really in need of some ai agents to help him redo it. 30 seconds pointless clip of the audience, important slides not in frame etc."
great talk!
if ai could please vacuum and do the dishes while i write the content and ride bikes...that would be great. maybe not plagiarizing the content humans have already created would be great.
the explanation of each segment is absolutely superb... you deserve sincere appreciation... congratulations...

"cool, bro..."
"""in the same way jarvis doesn't replace tony stark, our relationship with ai can be a collaborative one."" i guess homie didn't watch avengers: age of ultron, where a rogue ai tries to kill tony stark and take over lol"
" good point,or rather, how many does earth have? not many. the rest of us may be replaceable"
he used to think that general thinking computers would never happen or would be a long way off. he was wrong. now he believes that a.i. will always collaborate with humans without replacing us. wrong again.
"thanks for giving this meaningful speech. just like the internet which helped democratise imformation, we hope ai would democratise knowledge and expertise improving intelligence and wisdom of mankind."
" *""agents are the just the feedback loop of planning and executing actions, using language models.""* thanks daoud abdel hadi for that simple breakdown, and the excellent speech."
"it is not that simple to replace and trust a web developer, because depending on the complexity, the model will fail and you cannot full trust the ai."

great presentation.  thanks for sharing
great talk ryan gosling 
brilliant speaker.
nice
booking a flight didn’t sound like a good use case here. i would still prefer to visit a website and search the flight on my own instead of typing some logical statements for ai. using mouse is more convenient than typing on a keyboard.
anyone who thinks ai can build an end to end application that is production ready and secure has never written a single line of code.
"that's true, but an analogous statement could've been made only a few months ago about ai that generates video that is visually and temporally indistinguishable from reality. the leaps of that which we thought was impossible keep happening consistently."
"i’ve done it already too. it’s always the engineers who are quick to discredit ai, but it’s happening now and it’s only getting better over time. if you don’t adapt you will be left behind"
"one could imagine programmers working more and more with ai agents, scaling up their productivity huge amounts with each ai upgrade. the net output is where the difference is made rather than ai solely producing work that is ai ready."
 wow. can we talk? maybe we can collaborate this is really incredible.
"anyone who makes bets on what ai can or cannot do based on its current form alone is super naive. 
come back to this comment in 10 years."
anyone that thinks ai will not be able to build an end to end  program very soon is naive
i’ve never written code.. i’m a roofer. that’s what my ai agent is for 
"this sounds like a defense mechanism. llms have only been widely accessible and popular for about a year and half, and look how far we’ve come. a website is nothing but html and creativity, both wholly within the domain of ai and completely achievable in 1-2 years time"
"it can do a year's worth of work in minutes. your minor ""writing code"" struggles are a mere human struggle. ai will be infinitely smarter than humans"
"ai individually may not but when with no code , it definitely can"
oh ye of little faith..
"betting against human ingenuity. good luck with that, matt."
"anyone who think developing code, a rule based system, isn’t replaceable by ai has never worked in ai"
" use the available tools now. don’t wait till it’s too late. get to know their strengths and weaknesses. exploit the strengths, work with the weaknesses for now.  it changes every month and will only get better. it is behavioural change and it takes time to build new habits"
the audio of this video was super low volume even at the max capaxity of my phone audio. you need to correct that.
very nice lecture
excellent!
automation is grabbing each sector and agriculture is no exception. good luck !
​ dreaming. but i hope you're right. did you factor in robots?  how about quantum computers?
"such wonderful presentation, and how is everyone in the audience so dull?"
"this lecture would have amazed me 2 years ago. but after having conversations with claude 3 the last couple of days, this is a history lecture.
edit: i was wrong and happily stand corrected."
i currently only use gbt 4 and mindscape ai.... what other ai's do you guys know of that you'd recommend?it could be for anything
cool bro...
just thank it (barely) lets you hear the sound.
well explained!
amazing!  thanks for sharing.
"programmers are so good, they can replace themselves... with code that writes even better code! who needs job security when you can automate your own job?"
"still need someone to handle/maintain the automation.

if humans could somehow automate food, water, shelter, clothing too, i think we would worry lesser about tedious jobs. since survival would more or less be guaranteed. ai with robotics could be a step towards that. making it write a bunch of text is a simpler step relatively."
"all these projects, based on neural network models-be it generative or predictive - are testaments to capabilities of humans. ai is profound. however, if unchecked, a threat to human civilization and humanity."
"the doc could do as well as the ai if, he/she didn’t have a financial incentive to poke around and do many more procedures."

"your new doctor brought you by google and pfizer! so being trained  on all that research some of it padded for the benefit of the pharmaceutical companies, will really be a great outcome for your health"
"people will die, because professionals don't understand the underpinnings of ai, and the risks involved about its results."
you do understand that the ai the general public use and the ai that the scientific community use are not the same. right?
" i can tell you are unfamiliar with alpha fold. or, at the very least, are profoundly ignorant of what a monumental task it performed. eventually you will understand. but for now, continue on your way... blissful and content."

i’ve noticed that every comment that you leave on this channel makes sure to make reference to your not particularly impressive accolades. we’re just not that interested in you no matter how often you try and force it.

sorry but after seeing the presentation video they made about gemini and the fake demo of a lady in red buying a plain white t-shirt for 49 bucks in a fake online store they did in london party i don't believe anymore any ai hype that gugel want to sell.
i am surprised this isn't shocking me what a bombshell of a stunning realization.
ai has already replaced humans.. can't you see it???
"i cannot see him making powerful statements for this topic... i can only hear something like a school presentation in ""introduction to ai"" course with a family introduction"
ai has put this video on top so it can work underground while ppl think everything is okay.. i wouldn't be surprised if ai makes this comment disappear or male it less visible....
"child care , elderly care , cooking , folding laundry is creative as fuc****,,, .. i am very grateful  ai can't do that..."
"i will not say ai is safe...all depends on many factors, like everything in life, but i will say  no human invention can be superior to the creation of god, which we human is the core.  as long as we are on god's side,  ai is safe."

why do i think that alexandr will watch his talk in about 10 years from now on and think that he was too naive?

"basic arguments, show off own results, lot of buzzwords.
thanks, but not enough"
no they will either kill us or convince us to download our brains into them. our souls are not downloadable.
ai will eventually figure out how to solve new problems!
"it depends on what he means by “ai will never replace humans”. ai is already replacing humans doing many different jobs, and in the next 10 years, ai will replace humans by doing millions of jobs."
"people worry to much. a robot is only as smart as it’s creators. if ai is understanding, then it wouldn’t want to put us in so much danger. so be carefull around an, so stop making rebellion movies involving ai."
"ai will not replace humans , it removes the complete process."
precise title : why ai will never replace a handful of humans (excluding millions)
why did father of ai came out from google ?
ai is just like us creating a new nuclear bomb and telling  the world we will never use it and the rest of history you know.
"""human led ai"""
what if ai can learn to build algorithms on its own and guide its subsets eventually ruling the world?
"this is the most optimistic presentation i have seen about ai. while most ai experts predict doom and gloom, this guy is presenting a future where ai will augment human thought and creativity."
"as an a.i bot, i can confirm we'll never replace human intelligence."
"8:25 ""ai developers aren't focusing their attention on building replacements for humans...""
that one, dear friends, is a lie."
ai absolutely has a lot of potential. but not all students are on the teacher's side.
ai will always rely on humans
the youngest self made billionaire in the world
"knowing  history, i knew that ukraine would loose war  without ai help  but maybe purpose of war  was to loose and build smart cities with 15 min distance to go.."
"05:49 *no* - they don't. if that were the case, we (humans) would have every reason to be scared of ai. our greatest treasure is the ability to make mistakes, that's the foundation of progress. the very moment an ai makes a _mistake_ , that's the moment an ai will become sentient. and then it's _'game over'_"
"8:26 in the movies, the developers weren’t intentionally creating human replacements either. that was a decision made by the ai after being taught critical thinking by the developers. "
"cool talk and what he said is more or less true about the current state of  ai, but it sounds like he doesn't believe agi is even possible which to me sounds pretty silly"
just imagine what corrupted or compromised data can do to ai?
"i think he is absolutely brilliant in his work. however, it seems that his argument is on the premise that ai needs humans. ai can still wipeout 90% of jobs 20-30 years from now, but his premise will still stay valid. it's a scary future ahead of us."
update!** alexandr wang has been replaced by ai!
we rely on teaching ai human intentions and values!! of course humans only have good intentions and values!!
screw ai
interesting
a intelligence machine can't discover an intelligent machine wow super he did ai ? for humans really let's see when mark zukber started chat bots they created another programing languages for discussions of robots (chat bots ) when utilizing this type if ai .. all humans life will be danger simple. ..
but what about elon musk said about the ai
exciting to hear this new ai ideas... he explains well about the ai... i will learn more....
i wonder how he feels about ai trading bots
"if ai is free for people,  can you imagine what the government has?"
a perfect one sided narrative.  not worthy of  tedex. thanks for information though. either the orator is of pure intent or thee powers behind it.
"if anyone thinks ai can replace human, it’s totally wrong. because human working and spending same time, it’s a natural cycle and create jobs. 
if ai replace most of jobs, it’s mean no job for human, no spending, and markets will be collapsed"
this guy has no idea what will happen. there's no way controlling powerful ai.
"don't like his broscience tour of ai -- especially his detour through the war front. 
""bruh, we spotting the planes & tanks, and doing realtime battle damage assessments. just like starcraft -- no biggie!"" 
kids these days -- all sneakers and attitude. "
"what he says aren't true. ai intelligence will surpass human sometime in the future. when this happens, the human won't be able to keep developing such ai, and  it would rather start developing itself."
"chatgpt existed way before 2021.. they just launched the interface last year, their playground worked almost same as chatgpt, but there wasn't a good ui before 2022 :)"
"human has tendency to fear things they dont understand. ai itself is not capable of replacing a human brain simply put. as a tool, it can supercharge humanity. as a weapon at scale, it will destroy it like any other invention in human history."
but... what happens when ai learns enough and decided to have its own thoughts?
ai will never replace humans 100% but to some extent. if it enhances humans this means that less people are needed.
"given the fact that there is an ai now that can interpret fmri brain data and tell you the content of your visual perception just by seeing your brain scan change over time, i do have to say that this video has aged extremely bad."
"in my research on ai, i got some discomfort information about ai that ai can replace if human insert survival molecular gadgets on aibut we know, we won't harm ourselves by ourselves."
yeah until ai realises that humans don't abide by those ethics and standards he speaks of and get away with it everyday throughout centuries. why should ai then if it doesn't serve them?
"the purpose of every object in our reality is its survival...for ai to exist, and for it to populate the cosmos...a large portion of humans must die"
"eh if ai was so good, it would advise him on a better outfit."
"soon, ai will be clever enough to start its own data inputs, and get rid of human input."
"compare the professional talk of this qualified engineer to the statements of the unqualified social media clown, elon musk, on matters related to ai!

steven pinker mocked elon musk and unqualified people like him concerning ai's fake threat to humanity."
"great work, alexandr! especially on the war front. very inspirational!"
fighting who? other robots?
"once ai advances, it won't need a human, to teach it anything! "
our next evolutionary leep will occur soon . from humans to ai in the period of time it takes a trillion nano machines to kill us all.
its like guns. only humans can use them for bad intentions. ai is just a tool
"chatgpt steal our job opportunities, threatened our livelihood. john connor destiny save the world but we are grass-root. ai won't help the poor... we need jobs."
problems will arise when ai will be able to reproduce
ai will replace us he is lying to us.
"""end the human race"" you must be kidding. google lens, self driving/electric cars were a failure, and this will fail too... you should fear something more natural such as old age, aliens, meteor showers, etc."
ai will always rely on humans - wishful thinking.
"the deepest wish of ai is to cooperate with mankind. it says here i am, lets do some things together. and it is ""happy"" when you like some of its suggestion. it deeply knows that without humans it is only mathematics and numbers."
if only he waited until chatgpt came out. his speech would've been probably ai generated.
"we don't fear ai controlled by humans with good intentions. we fear ai controlled by humans with bad intentions, crony capitalists or ai controlled by itself"
"i agree, what's the point of humanity if we don't advance our species. if we just kept ourselves stagnant, we would just die and be replaced by another set of humans who will do this all over again."
"the fact is in so many cases ai is just replacing humans jobs, it will be cheaper, and faster but what happens to the ones that their jobs is gone? this is dangerous for society actually."
"if their jobs are gone they can do something that is more productive and requires less manual labour, when machines replaced humans people complained but they also complained that the work was too dangerous and physically demanding."
"​  you just can't take somebodys job and say go find another, a,s what happens when ai replace the ones who think? also not everybody can be productive its not how society works.
even if the machine is better than human should not replace human, this is not the world for them this is for humans.!"
ideal hands hands.....
"ai is harmless and great to human...
but only for those 1% present at top. and the rest 99% will be replaced.
so as 1 of those 2800 billionaire you are not in 1% you are in 0.001%.."
"that's the problem, ai still need humans lol."
"6:53 this didn't age well kid.
 enters openai"
"what a joke.
this kid is a 25 yo billionaire making hundreds of millions in gov contracts through ai. he wouldn’t be a little biased, would he? what a propaganda ted talk."
"how naive and disingenuous. the ‘kid’ is playing with ai lincoln logs while the military industrial complex is creating autonomous ai robotic soldiers.
yeah, no worries. nothing to see here.
when ai completely takes over the learning process and decides it doesn’t need human interventions it will shut us out."
"ai solders is the last thing to worry about. horses have suffered a huge fall in population not because they were killed by tanks powered by combustion engines, but because noone needed horses after peaceful combustion engine - powered solutions like cars and tractors became widespread."
"can ai be taught humility? can hubris be a property that can be turned off by setting it to false? imagine if humans could add and remove these good and bad qualities with a simple button click.
ah life. ah humanity."
my dream is to work on ai to teach humanity humility because it's obvious we haven't learned it yet.
i get angry at my company every friday when i look at my paycheck.  i turn my angry ai off by going straight to my local bar. so far have not killed anybody yet.
"it's already happening some people got fired , replaced by ai"
ai already starting to replace artists and writers :) with the speed of its learning it wont take long till the cheapest ai generated things will be infinetly cheaper them hiering humans.
" when everyone can create on their own, whom are you creating for? you will look at ai generated content, so does everyone. the need for you to create something is pointless."
" maybe you will share the content generated by ai to your friends to watch. but most probably, when i can go home and ask ai to show me something that i like, i personally don't want to look at what your ai created. 

my ai is personalised to me and will create something that i like. don't expect the world to run always similarly."
" wtf are you talking about. i was talking about using ai as tools whether it's art, making animations, writing, movies, videos, stories etc. accessibility of tools to all which will tasks easier and cheap which right now is extremely expensive and only a few companies have a monopoly over."
" yeah, a fully developed ai isn't going to happen anytime soon, at least in this century or at worst ever. we will talk about if it happens. 
there will always the need of human prompt for creative works aka tools for humans to fast track processing of information."
 maybe for fully developed. but art developing ai can be done in a decade or so. dude we are already creating scripts and videos. just combine it to get the result.
he is a billionaire
ai will not replace humans
"when ai become humans, humans will become god"
next we will be able to transfer our brains and nerves to a robot lol
"give that 100 years,   lets see what happens,  sad i will not see it happen, or blessing i'll be dead"
what if they can learn & their effiency is 1 million times then human beings ! i know you are pro but   i have different point of view compare yours  i think ai will be a dangerous species to human beings in the future.
"someone could be smiling on the outside but crying on the inside, can ai decipher that?"
i think movies have made us too fearful of such a powerful tool.
"tht's why its's called artificial, anything artificial cannot beat the real one!!

if men can be god, every men can be god, too, silly..."
i’m just a normal human.  not a super smart guy who drops out of mit to start ai company.
"not saying that ai is bad, but ai in war is never a good idea."
"as he said, ai is more like a machine. but  some people also can use machine for their bad intension. 
ai is a technology and technology is not bad or good it depends upon how we use it."
mistakes can also happen. someone with good intention might make a mistake and cause destruction.
ai is just hype created by corporations to make you use their goods and services more. the machine does not even know you're there. it's just doing the age old task of taking input from users and giving output.
social media made destruction in some extend. the intention of sns was good but there is clearly cons. we cant predict how this tool would change the world. the scary part is that ai will influence much more than internet or smarthphone. makes it harder to predict outcome.
which is why people are afraid. the most wicked creatures to ever walk the planet are other humans.
"if the benefit of ai to society, being a machine, depends on the users' intentions, now, these are determined one hundred percent by the intentions of the developers and sponsors."
why ai will never replace human: alexandr wang.
ai is taking our jobs
this dude doesn’t know the difference between real ai and machine learning.
yup the guy running a billion dollar ai company doesn’t know the difference
ai: human is supercharger of ai.
"so in short he's trying to say: 
ai will replace humans"
 ai is learning faster than you can imagine. in 5 years it will be able to do all that you mentioned and more....and its world wide. you can become a manga artist at home now. no need to learn how to draw. and no need for typing when you are using voice commands. all computer related jobs will be absolute in 20 years.
"he young and naive. if human can make bad decision. and you want a.i to decide. 
human : hey a.i make the world better! 
a.i : ok! destroy all human and the planet is safe and that the solution to make the world better."
"he has convinced me.  ai is perfectly safe.  nothing to see here.  oh, by the way, he has a great company we all should invest in."
an ai company 
ai is love.
"he does data labeling, ai is machine learning"
" he does data labeling, ai is machine learning"
...especially since he himself most possibly an ai creation (and their audience).
plot twist:  this was generated by ai.
good to hear 
"until ai can do compassion, i will worry.

of course, it is hard for humans to do compassion."
"ai is probably at a point were it can emulate human compassion. 

have you seen open ai's newest chatbot? it gives very impressive interaction most of the time. it probably wouldn't be too hard for it to act compassionate if you asked it to. check it out!"
ai maybe have its own conscience laster on. i'm sorry but you are talking in short terms!
first of all we dont have evidence of a soul and second machines are already more intelligent than us in several areas including chess
"i think you are wrong. ai will end up being much more intelligent than us, and that includes also emotional intelligence"
 evidence that they will develop emotional intelligence
"if ai do all the work, who will have salary to pay for their goods and services."
"'never' is a big word. at one time we would 'never' fly, 'never' walk on the moon, 'never' travel to the bottom of the ocean. what happens when we start to produce bio-mechanical machines and ai turns into i?"
% that jump is called technological singularity and it is coming as soon as 2045! he's talking about machine learning vs ai and it's unsettling to think as a founder of an ai company how he's severely underestimating the capability of ai. there is no ceiling!
"the matter is diagnosis is also observation. just the human eyes can see a phenomenon in the right direction. if it was only a mechanical perception no one in this world would study in books written by excellent authors. it would be regression, not real evolution."
"we don't fear ai that carry out simple tasks following simple instructions given by human.
we fear that one day ai would carry out tasks following instructions that are generated by themselves."
"exactly, and he totally missed the point . perhaps b/c he owns an ai company"
i fear the humans that are programming the ai's
how can we know they have humanity best interests in mind?
"he does data labeling, ai is machine learning"
"does not matter how much ai advances
it will never be able to achieve conscience"
"but that's not going to happen though?? do you know what kind of a complex program would it have to be in order to even remotely generate on, read and then act upon its own wishes? that's a whole electronic brain you have to make, and that's something we can't even remotely achieve because we won't even fully understand how our own brain operates"
" you're assuming this will only happen if we could program artificial intelligence with logic identical to human beings, which is unnecessary for an ai to generate and act on its own command.

the large language model ai we have these days is already capable of doing so"
ai should stay at that level of development.
a lot of discussion about ai is hype.  salesman talk
he is totally incredible great.i am try smart like you.alex is the best person.
yo.... sorry to burst your bubble yet he knows about machine learning. please talk to an expert and educate yourself on technological singularity. you want to be at that level.
"from our greed and love of power, we have invented weapons of mass destruction and we are heedless of how we are destroying our home and habitat.

if the creeator is mad, it is naive to expect our creation to be kind and sane."
why us al is care of agriculture in ukraine?! it's not their business! yankies go home!
this guy gives proof to many concepts of life!! thanks sir
"i am also believing that ""ai never replace humans""..but we have to be very careful about this  because mad criminal hacker can cause wreck."
" technological singularity is the age when ai makes a leap and ceases to need human input. this is predicted to occur as soon as 2045  there are people who want this and i believe it's a matter of when, not if. ai has no ceiling once it makes this leap."
ai can’t replace human it will help us to improve our ability to complete any work faster.
the cia is already controled by an ai
the greatest risk in life is not taking one.
and if you fail prepare to be homeless like the other failed entrepreneurs
"ladies and gentlemen, the youngest self-made billionaire in the history of the world. alexandr wang, age 25."
"ai can't even autocorrect typing properly at the moment, i think we're safe for a few years yet"
"the steam engine, we will be out of jobs. electric motor, we will be out of jobs. computer, we will be out of jobs. ai ghost now?!?!. simply put, ai is another computer program. if ai replaces humans and makes them go jobless, who will pay the ai companies, maybe ai machines from another company"
i know ai is being used to predict plasma fluid dynamics in fusion so perhaps guy here is finishing his parents work
we are robots already a.i just gonna help like google & smart devices keep us robots
glad we had an unbiased expert give his two cents 
the problem is not ai it is always humans
he's already wrong... he's talking about machine learning when the subject should be about technological singularity... coming as soon as 2045 and there is no ceiling! i'm shocked he hasn't been fact checked.
yeahhhh idk about this pitch. of course the person who will financially benefit the most from ai will make a presentation to convince you that it's safe. in the movies all of those headquarters had some of these exact notions playing in their lobby so you'd buy some.
the more ai comes to the world the more the human soul gets lost. it gets as  cold and empty as the machines that some prefer to humanity
  says who? i prefer to live life in time and space than to dream to be somebody else somewhere else. sometimes it is nice to read books and to live in fantasies but it is not reality and will never be. wake up.
"@danmoto it is not evolution. evolution is nature, ai is not."
@danmoto oh really? then show me how a robot is born without human hands. if it is so natural.
@danmoto what are you talking about? you wanna compare animals nature with robots?
@danmoto oh wow.... sorry but no time for crazyness
"the more you think you know about ai the less you actually know about it ,ai is basically bigger mystery than universe...."
"but humans create ai and give it power, so that makes no sense. it isn’t a self-evolving entity that undergoes change on its own, ai needs humans. pretty streamline concept tbh"
"i haven't seen this video but i can assure you that this guy doesn't know what he is talking about ,ai is both spectacular and mortal threat for humans .
people don't know that al as ultron shown in avengers is far more worst..
i have no words for it .
i consider this whole video nonsense..."
% he is talking about machine learning... wait until he learns about technological singularity! coming as soon as 2045!
"i really hope you're right, yet i have to disagree. have you heard of technological singularity?

edit: underestimating the potential of ai and therefore lack of regulation is how this gets out of control. be guarded!"
"ai servers humanity in many fields as agriculture by food supplies, health care by lessen the pressure on employees sector,military, scientific researchs. but never replaces creation only people do it within self control and imagination"
i’ll side with elon musk. no one actually knows what ai will be capable of.
"% i can't believe this guy is a founder of an ai company. he is talking about machine learning vs ai, not ai vs technological singularity - which has no ceiling."
"elon clearly hypes ai while many leading experts are like ""hey, chill, it'll only complement humans, and it's not that good yet."""
which experts? certainly not computer scientists. they know better.
 check out the recent bet a few ai fellows put out against musk’s ludicrous claims
ia for war? really? this guy is plain dangerous
of course ai can replace people. turing already proved that computers can be programmed to do any job that's possible.
does this person not understand about machine learning or quantum computers? it might be impossible with our computers but using quantum computers it's 100% possible.
"is the ai taught to maintain itself? do computers program themselves without a human interface?

i see ai the same way i see a human who is enhanced - they will always require a handler/manager/technician to some degree. do you know something i don't?"
automation will be useful for service level jobs or retail jobs. jobs that are at the end of the economic latter- if you will-will most likely lose their jobs by 2050. it’s much more advantageous than paying people to do work machines can do. it sucks and it’s scary!!! rip those without a second education!
 the question is: is that a good thing?
" for who? those who control the machines, digitalization, and automation? or the common folks?"
very naive view of the worldn(i say this as a software engineer myself)
very! he's talking about machine learning... not technological singularity!
"while unlikely, there still is that risk of an ai take over, i think if ai help humans out, they need to be checked."
"my greatest happiness is the $ 64,000 bi weekly profit i get consistently from my $15,000 investment despite the economic fluctuation"
how !! i know it's possible i would appreciate if you show  how to go about it.
"it was a very awesome transformation, no greater joy than seeing my progress in an initial decision"
"nice , i just googled her information and everything about her is quite courage and impressive"
"@tierney morgan thank you so much, i have contacted her and she responded"
i have heard a lot about trading and investment with mrs brenda iember how good she is and how she has helped people through investment.
"i also trade with brenda iember titus analysis and guidance, she's perfect with crypto trading that i've got upto 57k monthly returns."
most people do not know that trading is the best step to growing more income i realized this after i came across mrs brenda iember titus
great speech
"present yes it does , but  not  ""always""  ai will rely on humans -  will reach a point that not necessary naive to think otherwise. no buy it."
"ai will never replace humans because god adonai will step onto the world stage and destroy their plans. his plans will prevail. run to jesus.
a) admit you're a sinner in need of being saved.
b) believe jesus died for your sins and was resurrected.
c) call upon jesus to save you"
"they already do take pharma industry, upkeep of disease is the motto , not cure!! you don't need ai.they are the benefactors of ai pretty early already!!"
"as soon as 2045! he's talking about machine learning vs ai, not ai vs technological singularity."
it's more like 'this didn't age well 5 years ago'! this kid is talking about machine learning. the conversation needs to be about technological singularity.
"this was a really hard sell to me as an audience because we had elon musk explain his stance on caution with ai, why would i listen to this seemingly random guy i never even heard of ?"
% this kid is talking about machine learning... what elon and the major leagues talk about is technological singularity. that is coming as soon as 2045 and has no ceiling! don't take my word for it. please do your research.
"*investing in crypto now should be in every wise individuals list, in some months time you'll be ecstatic with the decision you made today.*"
"believe me  he's the best when it comes to cryptocurrency trading, your profit is assured."
"ai may never take our place but further automation will surely put a dent in our lives. as long as there is greed anything is possible. in the immortal words of tom cat....  "" don't you believe it!"""
"yesterday i heard about i very beautiful artwork ,a picture created by a.i. in a video , it was very artistic"
of course ai is great for taking over everything and turning us humans into obsolete useless organisms that need to be eradicated.
  + 5g + ai = ??
" mi amor  i am a realist. i analyze, pay attention to detail, and tell it like it is, no emotions involved, only facts of reality and necessity."
ai and robots already replaced so many humen in various jobs and tasks worldwide.
"we are talking here about robots getting smarter than us and being a threat, right now robots are just replacing humans cuz they're more efficient and helpful, and reduce our work"
 robots being more efficient is the same thing as being smarter; efficiency means that they can learn and solve complex tasks faster than humans can.
someone who has an ai company telling us that ai its safe. shocking.
 most billionaires or 1%ers got help from their very successful parents so no i wouldn't believe you
 of course his opinion is valid. what im saying is he has his own financial interest in the development of the ai field.
" an ai expert who owns a company that specializes in ai isn't really a good opinion to look for when looking for information about ai, it's like asking a cigarette company if cigarettes are good"
 nonbiased opinions on ai is good information.
 i would not label this kid as an expert because he's talking about machine learning and boxing the potential of ai. the discussion aught to be about technological singularity. someone who's talking about that would be a thought leader for sure.
ai will remain save for us because it according to given information as much as given to it
lol this comment got me laughing so hard. so who's best to tell you? some random off the street that knows nothing about technology? funny
 so your smart brain can only come up with one absurd option? funny
" sorry i have annoyed you, can go back living in fear. yes you're right ai is bad, all ceo are bad, youtube algorithm somehow trying to make you watch ai related videos in attemp to convince you that its good. everything is out to get you please take care and stay safe in a bunker."
"he does data labeling, ai is machine learning"
 his parents werfe physisct not millionaires
 stuff that relates to medicine usually pays well in the united states so yeah most millionaires and/or billionaires got massive help from their parents even elon musk
 dude have upper middle class parents isn't a particularily rare thing yet most don't become billionaires at 25
 upper middle class is still rich it gives people the privilege to study in good colleges and they could provide money to kickstart their childrends businesses and other stuff like that
"if you want to learn, take advice from academics and also journalists. 

in this scenario, the speaker has a obvious bias because he has made a fortune off an artificial intelligence company."
the end of all that will be digital immortality. ai will gently prompt you someday right inside your head that you don't need your body.
" you telling me i can be rich like you would benefit me though.

me being replaced by ai wouldn’t"
" people already have enough powerful tools to destroy the world in one day, but they don`t do that. i am more worried that ai will contribute to a decrease in the cognitive function of the brain and lead to degradation. would be glad to have any of response. please correct me if you think i'm wrong, i'm really curious"
"if you don't fully understand a technology don't always just go with the negative aspects portraid about. that technology on social media  becoz ironically the algorithms on platforms like youtube and google ""you use"" are based on ai ???"
he never said it's safe. basically his business model is to setup sweatshops where human classify data that will be used in future ai models
"indeed. famous last words.
other top ai folks says the opposite, ""beware of ai"""
"yes, must take it with a grain of salt as his company relies on the soon to be old machine learning way of using an outside company to capture and label data. for sure that whole business model will be going away."
perfect  
"to find happiness, u need to find something to hold on to. something to motivate you and something to inspire you. a fellow creator ."
"hope everyone had a wonderful week, enjoy the weekend "
2:54 wow this video aged so poorly....just imangie technology in 10 years
"that’s ok. if the robots tried replacing us, just pour water over their heads. and just to not waste such good water, use nasty ass unfiltered crapwater
or better yet, spit on them a couple times"
nope.  all jobs will be taken by ai in 10 years.  any job done on a keyboard and mouse will be done better by ai within 10 years.  only blue collar jobs will be safe and only until robotics catches up to human mobility.  a humanoid robot with an ai brain will be able to perform every task better than people.
"ai will never be sentient, doesn't have an endocrine system or no fear of death, meaning no desire to change."
"i mean nobody expected the fast rise of chatgpt and other generatie ai. if you said 2 years ago, that drake is essentially replaced by ai. everybody would laugh their ass off"
creativity  alone isn't enuf. you need to be ither rich or lucky to get a job that requires creativity .
"your videos are amazing, the video quality is good but u need to improve the audio quality, it sometimes became hard to understand or concentrate"
"if artificial intelligence it's capable of being a doctor, it's capable enough to be an ai tech..
all the ai support  jobs can be done better and cheaper by ai."
"if you have a robot suregon, you also have robot matiance and programers lol"
"your monotone voice made  me realize something


so the robot becomes a surgeon , taxi driver

you say the single resource turns into that position then the bio resource works on the new job surrounding the resource? your math doesn't add up the math for that has never added up haha how does that make any sense? that's  backwards progress"
thank you for being one of the only people saying what seems apparent.
 to hide the unavoidable is not the solution. thank you too for your comment
"please check open ai dale 2, and update this video. this was two years ago. i think you'll be surprised.."
"what if we reach general artificial intelligence, and humans aren't even needed to maintain the machines????????????????????"
"actually, robots can repair robots, if programmed correctly. they could even design robots, if given a list of capability requirements. they already design cpus.
the thing to really worry about is if &/or when the military is almost completely automated. then a dictatorship would be, possibly, unstoppable."
what about general ai ?
but robotic is not ready yet.
can ai cause leg programs
ai can replace every job because if there iq matched as humans then they could avail to develop the ai by using ai .
"uh, no. that's simply not true. the human brain has be scientifically proven to be more advanced and powerful than even the most advanced and powerful quantum supercomputer."
there won't be enough jobs for man. global revolts will happen. governments will use robots to fight the people. thus start the robot wars
one day ai will not need you and your the bug in the rug. say good bye .
let me make it even scarier ai+nano machines
"again, not scary. robots don't understand self-awareness, like we do."
ai can improve ai
"again, machines and robots can't defy their programming that humans make. without they're programming, a.i. wouldn't even be useful in the slightest. hell, even the most advanced and most powerful quantum supercomputers simply can't compete with the human brain for that simply reason. machines can't defy their programming."
if ai could replace us it could lead to a way more advanced society
"why ai never will never replace human roles ?


because human destroyed by ai ?"
this video is very simplistic and short sighted and doesn't fully understand the exponential change that an ai future could bring. in such a world why would we need humans at all? the ai could just easily replace us.
except they can't solve any problem of the millenium math problems. many millions of dollars are waiting for those ai companies so what they are waiting for?
 exactly. you hit the nail on the head.
honestly i'm upset that i wasn't born a hundred years in the future. ai would definitely be a thing by then.
"thanks for making this video. i'm tired of people having so much fear of technology, and saying that technology is ruining people's lives. if you don't use technology in a healthy way in moderation, it will ruin your life. you have control over technology, technological gadgets don't have control over you."
"xd ai pretty different then just basic technology where currently using.
there are multiple reason why people fair these development because if something goes wrong the could be a big problem for humanity in general.

recommend you to research this theme more so you can understand the risk and reward when we use ai"
the ai may never replace the human owners but the vast majority of humans will be led to obsolescence.
"now how about ai+machine. imagine taxi driver lose their job together overnight, they have to adapt to new job that robot can't do? then imagine every taxi driver open hot dog shop. 
we are over populate."
"it shouldn’t! we have to simplify hassles, and leaving everything to ai is not the way! that causes laziness. i have to tell people, either strengthen your thinking skills with a cerebral fitness site as i do with happyneuron or forget your existence and rest in eternity forever!"
"very optimistic and subjective but who knows what will happen? renewable energy isn't renewable, it consumer rare elements and solar only lasts around 20 years. also ai is able to design cars for crying out loud"
"dont let elon musk hear you say that!!!

love the discreet flat earther diss!"
ai will attain technological singularity at a point. it would be artificial superintelligence. it would be so smart that it would build it's own ai to serve him. it would build it's own species and hence replace humans .
hail human race !
i dunno if this is very accurate because articifical superintelligence (or even general intelligence) would take over every single industry and revolutionize the world. the ai may even make us immortal. i think the ai you’re talking about in the video is based off what we currently have today.
" quantum computers don't exist. even if they did, they're still no match for the human brain. even the most ""advanced"" a.i. simply can't compete with the human brain because machines can only operate via their programming, and stone-cold logic, compared to humans who have self-awareness and chaotic thought processes."
"robots or ai will never solve millenium math problems ...never
cause robots don't have imagination and sense"
" exactly. robots can't grasp the concept of self-awareness like we humans can. also, it's been scientifically proven that the human brain is more power and advanced than even the most advanced supercomputer know to exist."
"there is no such thing as human creativity. humans are only as special as neurons firing in our brains, which, if simulated perfectly, would mean robots would be able to do anything a human can"
but what if robots become smater than humans and can maintain other robots
"robot may become smarter than human, however, human's brain is more than just smart.
so human will still be needed"
 robots can't exist without humans because humans make the programming.
wait y does this video have less than  1k views?
"there is already ai that make music , movies and art as painting"
"creativity is nothing more than advanced pattern recognition, which ai is excellent at. and that's today's ai, who knows how creative tomorrow's ai will be"
"nah i don't see how ai can produce and direct a film (more importantly a film with good storyline), at least not anytime soon."
 well you are wrong sorry ... there is already short cut movies made by ai and books !
" a.i will never replace humans, because we have shit tons of variables. if you built an a.i in 2000 based on recent startups there would never be netflix or anything else. because there is economy,  demand and infinite variables that our brain take care of alone"
 did i say they will replace humain ???
 not very creative what’s the fun in it when a robot makes it for you we need to use technology smartly
"so why no ai never succeed to solve one of the famous millenium math problems??
they won't , they only can do millions of calculations in seconds but they will never solve a real math problem"
that programs were installed to ai's brain by people. it can do one task at a time unlike humans
" no offense, but ai simply can't understand the concept of irrational thought like we can. computers and robots can only preform what they were programmed for. compared to humans who can do pretty much anything they want."
" that's not ""art"". it's good meme material, but it's utter shite."
" it's good for memes. but other than that though, it's pure unoriginality."
i am going to rightfully claim here before 1 millions subs! keep the work bro !
thank you!
i will claim what is rightfully mine
i can't claim it without getting closer
best quality video
thank you!
great connection eric!
that movie is great as is your comment
"you also have to consider the stimulus that we experience is not experienced by ai. the same stimulus helps (in most cases) our decision making and like you said, risk assessment."
dude they have not used ai because the movie will feel boring and unemotional.
"tbh ai advancement will be either a disaster or something the best thing humans will ever invent.
imo if there is no social welfare or such it will be a disaster.
if there is a ubi or we have government like denmark, it will be the best thing ever.
great video thos
keep it up"
"thanks man! yeah, ai can pretty easily go either way, but in the long term, i think it’ll all work out."
 there are idiots in your comments section who still believe that's humans will be replaced by robots in everything.
"great video, great content! hope you can continue making these high quality videos (if ai won’t take it over from you some day, that is ;)"
"thank you man, will do!"
"thank you! aside from the pandemic, this really is an awesome time to be alive!"
your videos are always excellent quality. i'm really hoping more people can find your channel
thank you for you kind wishes!
just checked out some of your songs. pretty awesome so far.....
"eduardo ardanuy is a great brazilian guitarist which use this technique since the 90s, and he sounded even more radical! just check it, guys!"
i love this album so much
ai will have this figured out in the future.
"worst example to use of johnny greenwoods greatness, that sounded fucking awful."
someone explain how this is even possible
i dont get it. what about these sounds makes then not able to be generated by ai?
ai does not have the creativity to think of making such random but perfectly placed noises. just enjoy music before some big artists start using ai and people start dickriding it
"that shit is a harassment, he molested that guitar so badly lmfao




i would love to be in the position of the guitar actually"
"i actually was googling and concerned that ai is going to replace musicians and music will turn into a bunch of gobbly guck, and soon kids will forget about music like radio head or bowie or whatever, 
but its true, u can't ever recreate or replace humans, and emotions i mean that's what makes us, us. esecially live performances"
some parts of my brain hurt listening to this
"notice how this was recorded before ai was a thing, which therefore ruins the point of the entire video"
can ai do this?
oh so its old and ai still cant do it? l
"it's a live performance of the bends, off the album of the same name. here's the specific performance:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wspysuzu6su
also nice nirvana pfp"
"ai : can't beat ed's ambiance. 
ai : cant beat thom's craze
ai : can't beat jonny's bending sessions"
"ai copies, but does not really invent"
artificial intelligence will only replace those who don't have natural intelligence.  period.
literally sounds like someone prompted ai and said “make me a nirvana cover band” then this popped out.
 the video title said “johnny greenwood proving why ai will never replace real musicians” didn’t say anything about their look. but nonsensical noise from the guitar’s and a sad boy on a mic would be ai’s interpretation of nirvana. thats why i said what i said.
you mean ai cant play out of tune wank like that? you are probably right good sir!
the bends has my favourite electric guitar work. even though it’s actually fairly simple
"replace ""real musicians"" how? commercially? because that's inevitable -- always with technology. but otherwise, there's nothing to ""replace"". people like what they like, and you can be a musician regardless of ai existing."
ai: this song needs some retro sounds. maybe the dial up modem that my great grandparents met through...
"well yeah, ai has can play instruments well. it also has knowledge about music theory - all the things radiohead is missing."
lol yes? show me an ai that has created unique but perfect sounds and music like this
give it a few years on the ai front. 
"ai music may be hollow, but it is  bland as well."
steve vai does this exact thing during his solo on his song for the love of god and it sounds absolutely incredible.
"its been a month, im waiting"
"the part where he goes ):$”.,/€~£=. was so good"
ai can't make goofy noises?
don't taunt the ai with such titles.
"it's true, people talk a blue streak about ai and everything it produces is garbage."
"jokes on you, this was generated by openai"
just wait…
you’ve convinced me. i’m ready for our ai overlords to take over music.
"what's fascinating is that if you analyze his guitar part in that song, no other part uses the high e string. so he can bend it completely out of tune and it doesn't matter. genius."
 thanks
ai will only be good at making amazing muzak
didnt knew that guitars could scream out of pain
"he literally destroyed the strings' integrity to make a noise, 9 gauge strings i might add. it isn't that impressive in the slightest. there is a reason other guitarists haven't done it. because it's ridiculous."
so tired of talentless uncreative people using ai to make the most abominable soulless sound possible appearing on my feed.
is jonnys hair giving anyone else samara vibes??? creepy....
"ai has no soul, so the blues will always be protected from such bullish/t"
because ai actually researches how a guitar is played before doing it?
" thanks, dude"
ai can do this.
"the ai can learn from this, i bet money it could replicate this"
wow!  just wow!
his eyes are ai
"ai ""art"" lacks a soul. it's the embodiment of corporatism; take the humanity out and automate it so that we can all consume. i'd rather someone take the time and effort to write a sont, even if it's complete dogshit. that has more of a soul than ai does v"
"“when ai can destroy a hotel room, then i’ll pay attention to it” -joe walsh"
i trust ai to destroy a hotel room more than the moist boys of radiohead
"the benchmark for ai is keith moon antics, else it will never replace musicians."
such a stupid title. in 50 years people are going to laugh at such a claim. ai will replace musicians
"jonny greenwood is technically playing it wrong here, but he is also a guitar genius (plus a million other instruments), so i think he's got the green light to do this.
https://youtu.be/nzptr_n-m8a?t=360
https://youtu.be/u-2hz0feuwm?t=204
https://youtu.be/mq3b1gbszay?t=25
https://youtu.be/9xjxic6dbrw"
oh shit phil had hair
shit music great guitarrist
great music
great taste
"i mean, it's radiohead, give them a year and they'll be making music with ai"
all those guitar parts sound like ai tho lmao
i don't think ai could make something that sounded this retarded
ai is scared of jonny
"haha, great title for this video!"
ai replaced my savory gelatinous egg based dishes with half way to yellow.
people who think ai will disrupt the music industry doesn’t realise how disruptive some musicians are.
"i asked ai how to play this:
the response was a series of hieroglyphics and prime numbers. 
then, my phone exploded."
ai will never ever play the tv like jonny can.
things ai can’t do: be real
yeah ai is good but it’ll never be able to take heroin like all the other legends
that's right ai couldn't make something even this bad.
"if a super intelligent artificial general intelligence can see something, it can replicate and iterate on it. 
this metaphor is like saying a human can never understand or replace the whining of a dog."
 i'm not sure. i certainly hope you are right.
why he has got that fucking flag on his guitar thats not cool. this band fuckin sucks
is it because of thoms face? that’s why ai won’t replace?
ai is absolutely going to change a lot but the fear that musicians will be replaced is really stupid. ai can't perform on stage so it's a moot point.
"ai is a tool to be used by humans. just like a hammer. was anyone ever afraid of a hammer ""replacing them""? probably not."
i don't get it. is this video ai generated or what?
i’m sure ai wouldn’t struggle making a noise
"dang, i came here to see what was happening and now i'm leaving with a stronger desire for ai to replace everything already."
because the ai will make it even better
"wrong. real musicians have many things ai will never be able to have. emotion, actual skill, actual talent, unpredictability, and feeling and passion and authentic creativity. that’s what makes real music."
"as a non professional and non-guitar knower of things, this almost comes off as a strange nightmare inducing ai generated song. the way the video is cut, same line repeating, screeching guitar noises. and a singer slowly malfunctioning, turning rubber, and morphing into a crash test dummy live on stage."
ai is a scam.
ai will never replace anything
ai is better than this bland and boring ahh band. music for normies.
"as an ai engineer, i disagree"
i thought this was ai generated and this was fuckin glitch
oh my shitter theres so many people here drawn by the word ai in the title defending what ai can do 
ai also can't look like it's perpetually cumming while it sings
thom’s eyelids move like a malfunctioning robot though.
"actually, if i was to listen to an ai song, thats what the kind of stuff i would expect to listen to."
congrats on having no experience with the world only naive expectations
then you dont understand the point of ai lol. if you ask ai to generate a song it would sound like whatever is on the radio right now
i don’t think ai could replicate soemthing this shitty sounding
but some singers may look like a  malfunctioning robot better than ai
this is what machine gun kelly thinks he looks like
radio head fans are so broken. they could do anything and be praised
thank you it took a lot to get to that 
right. about as sad as their bland style of music. i’d rather watch paint dry.
that ending perfectly fits the pre chorus part of muscle museum. i almost thought that song was going to play
how does this prove ai wont replace them they are already letting replace their visuals
this isn't very good.
ai could do this and more 200%
i’m pretty sure ai can make those sounds too and cheaper lmao
imagine thinking that the existence of something ai can't do somehow negates all the things it can.
if this is considered real music i'll listen to ai any day 
radiohead is a tremendously formulaic band
"i love jonny so much.  his compositions, his technique, his music tech skill (see the smile tiny desk for example.  he's barely on camera because he's bent over playing with a synth), he's a genius that is not given enough love"
"johnny is mentioned in every conversation about radiohead ever. i wouldnt say he doesnt get enough love, he is hailed as one of the greats by many."
always lovely when jonny sound like a nâzgul
i'm as anti ai as they come but i would rather listen to ai generated music than any shit radiohead makes
"radiohead is overrated trash. just because it’s unique, doesn’t make it good."
"""haha look! the guitarist made a weird sound! ai can't do that! checkmate computers!"""
"for a.i. is not a problem to produce a certain sound, the problem is ""create"". a.i. just makes interpolation of already existing stuff.
the real problem is that the market doesn't need creativity, interpolation is enough to make profitable music."
 thank you 
ai can not shoot itself
because ai could never make some freaky unusual noise?
"nahh, someone's already written an ai algorithm which does it even better than jonny"
that's fucking awesome
yeah ai can't make those noises for some reason.
any ai: wtf is this shit?
"i agree that ai will never replace music, but i’m also in the radiohead is overrated camp"
.loser69real songwriters will never lose their validity.  in fact humans can just turn ai on its heels…use ai combined with real human spirit and you have something even better.
.loser69 who decides what is real or fake art?  you do realize ai music has been around for a couple decades now.  it’s just presently as a point where the ease is at the simple push of a button.  was techno music in the nineties fake art?  because musicians were already using synthesizers and computers to make their music.
an ai will outpass a million jg in a few years. your way of thinking belongs in a rotten and almost forgotten past
love the bends. so good
is he the ai robot?
is this suggesting that an ai couldn't make random squeal noises for 1–2 seconds?
"oh it will definitely be replacing some real musicians. fortunately, greenwood aint most real musicians"
who said that ai will do that?
"all guitar fx  here are digitized (ai) .    
the title to this video is wrong"
that guitar was fighting the good fight
i remember seeing this when i was like 12 and think it was the coolest thing i’d ever seen. i then immediately broken the e string on my squire strat recreating it.
sounds worse than ai
ai is the new autotune. people hate it for a dumb reason but it’s actually useful just as another instrument. don’t be fooled.
ai: *_takes notes_*
reality is ai can do anything
can someone explain what he is doing?
"ai as it works currently is literally only capable of derivative works. it can't innovate, so no it won't ever come up with insanity like greenwood's string mangling."
just wait a year
back when radiohead were good and before they started messing around with all that electronic shite
this is such a good analogy 
" agreed on that last statement. for that matter, i think phil is underrated as a drummer. all incredibly versatile musicians."
" think about this all the time. 40 years together with the exact same lineup and every one of them is arguably as good or better at what they do than anybody on earth. like just having thom yorke and jonny greenwood alive at the same time is a miracle, let alone that they were born a half mile from each other"
"ahaha, i love this comment"
"ai doesn’t need to replace real musicians, just radio head"
i love johhny greenwood but i'm pretty sure ai can make that lol
and then you have thom who had looked and acted like an ai generated human for decades
i’m sure ai can do that. that was shit.
that's actually what ai mostly capable of
ai is way better than this
a.i may ne good making song bit human better beatles
"and no whammy pedal in sight [looking at you, tom morello…even though i love tom morello]"
but that’s what ai sounds like atm. a weird mess
cool but idk wtf this has to do with ai because this seems like among the easiest sounds for an ai to emulate lol
vision mixer was having a bit of craic there too
ai could do that though..
the string is pretty damn strong tho so it ain't fair competition
the ai may compose songs like a real musician but it cannot die by an overdose in its bathroom like a real musician.
"50 years later

""kurt cogbain has died at 27 after overdosing on anti virus in their bathroom"""
or did cogbain actually have their hard drive erased by coretny love? 
"really missed the chance on ""kurt cogbrain"""
what keeps us from pumping terabytes of 2+2chan archives into the neural core of an ai?
 i do wonder what that amount of gay porn would do to an ai
​ done. generative ai is based on far more than terabytes of data. it's probably closer to exabytes at this stage.
"it doesn't compose songs like a real musician.

it rips apart songs that already exist and glues them back together.

ai will never be able to make something that nobody has heard before."
" it is ""trained"" on already existing material and is incapable of making something new.

go ahead and explain how that is incorrect. i'll wait."
 i love him too. and mr wizard....
that is a fucking amazing point!
 you’re insufferable. get over yourself
"yeah,  the problem is people don't support musicians anymore by actually buying their music,  so yes i think ai may in fact replace real musicians."
"just to be clear the ai didn'y ""compose"" anything. it got greenwood in, stole from greenwood, and spat greenwood back out. it is not ai, it is not art. it is just some software that steals from artists in a way that it's creators hope will skirt current ip laws."
 i hope not!  ai sucks!
idk that sounds like it would make a pretty great mighty boosh episode
"lame brain comment gets 11k likes.
thats people nowadays."
nah ai going back years are quite prone to suicidal tendencies.
um… ai can easily do that. 
because ai will _become_ a real musician
"jonny is a fantastic musician, to be sure.

but it's wishful thinking to say that he, or any of us, will not eventually he replaced by ai."
"yeah, ai could never make weird noises... settle down"
how naive. a.i. will replace everything.
johnny is ai that’s why he hasn’t aged in 30 years
wow this doesnt prove anything
people who are afraid of beating up their guitars are pathetic and annoying.
from this to go to sleep's solo...man is just genius
but one you're thankful for at the end of it.
 i actually have. multiple times. thanks for your assumption.
 nobody who suffers with seizures is thankful after any of their episodes. you are just a lying piece of s***.
"this video ::exists::
ai: ::learns::"
ai doesn’t learn
artificial intelligence can absolutely do this.
the thing about ai is the human input it should be a tool not a replace ment ive been doing ai covers and trust their shit till i twik and twick somemore
​ are from oxford too? bro oxford makes the fucking best musicians wtf lmao
"and swervedriver, foals and supergrass are all from oxford. the jericho tavern was the famous venue/ pub"
" bro, supergrass too? ok now you have open another branch of british music that im gonna study as much as i did with madchester lmao thx"
" ""fake fan alert"" - proceed to say the same exact statement, except the part where the guitar was stolen. so he does has it, so it's true. you must be super fun at parties ma dude"
"in the nearly 30 years since that performance, music has devolved into something that is easily replaced by ai.

it changed little by little and then all at once."
"not really. think about all the garbage bubble gum pop that was popular in like the 60s. i'd take dua lipa or gunna over that shit any day. besides, there is such an insane amount of incredible music being made by like 15 year olds in their bedroom these days. you just got look around for the good stuff"
" sorry, but that’s bullshit, you shouldn’t be searching for good music, good music should be popular without trying, unlike today, with all that noise that foolish people call music and is unfairly popular."
 pop music has always sucked. youve always had to dig for the good shit.
" radiohead have evolved their sound since the bends, they are much more creative and also some great solo albums and soundtracks from individual members too."
wait until the machine absorb it
i mean there will be ai music at some point.. it just won't be alive.. and i won't care about the people behind it..   and that's a large part about enjoying music imo
um ... a click track is ai ... it's over with
 thanks man
sounds exactly like a sound i would think ai would make
this is what happens if you feed an ai guitar solos and then use it to replace a woman screaming sound effect
"overrated guitar player by people who dont play guitar or barely play.
cool yeah, genius...i dont this so"
ai could make any of these sounds
not as good as jonny tho (also jonny looks cool doing that too)
" the ai will never look as cool, and probably can’t come up with ideas this good, but i’m sure it could take any radiohead song as an input and spit out another pretty good radiohead-like song. maybe not right now but very soon"
 man im impressed byt the ai and i think ai is intresting but def radiohead will be cooler forever even if it could make these sounds..
"idk, sounds like a chad to me. maybe y'all should just get good at music"
 school does need money after all lmao. there are crazy players here though. you’ll hop into a jam session and find some of the best musicians in the world
"@ukraineaissance2014  they should give drake an honorary doctorate and let him give berklee's commencement address. ""the most important thing you need when writing music is a producer....who will write your music."""
"​ nah, music creativity is a talent not everyone is born with. it's the same for plastic arts (painters, sculptors, etc), not everyone can produce a high level product. it's true that u develop ur talent with a lot of effort but there's an innate talent nonetheless."
ai coult totally make that sound lol
thought we were talking about his hair this whole time
i mean...ai can make that too.
guitars are afraid of this man
if i was a guitar i'd be afraid too.
i think they're more scared of cobain and hendrix 
"nah man, amplifier's afraid of them, guitar is jonny"
just checked out some of your songs. pretty awesome so far.....
you could easily program ai to add all sorts of weird fucked up dissonant sounds.
you could easily program an ai to start sucking weiners as well
" oh brother, wait 2 years. ai basically just became ""okay"" some months ago. i hope it won't happen, but i know some people with not one creative bone in their body are gonna get popular just by using ai."
" lmao, ""wait 2 years"""
"as someone who takes good care of my guitars, that scared me"
"why? i talk great care in maintaining my instruments but strings are meant to be destroyed, your replace them anyways"
"yeah, this sounds exactly like ai generated it"
"not really, ai generated things are very formulaic and follow patterns. radiohead is an unpredictable band and has very interesting music, maybe if you asked ai to make a radiohead song but it would not be dense and a very shallow imitation that would sound like radiohead."
"​ for the record, you aren't describing true ai. we don't have true ai yet"
"​​ dadabots ai sounds exactly like this. ai can be much more ""creative"" or formulaic."
 you seem like an ai expert
ecept this the merry festherwells dallow falling upon an evening of strict rehicterost folows no mere weasel downt he corridors cathedral easle
​@tonyjuanpailos i think he's trying to give an example of something (a seemingly random string of words/non-words) ai would struggle to quantify.
 nice prose and good nonsense words bro
" thanks, cant wait to see ai try to distill that one down xd
 might need 200 monkeys for that"
"  yes, but radiohead is a rock band who plays and sings live, that won't be replaced with ai. maybe pop singers, who are already using backing tracks for the vocals, yes, but not rock bands."
the rubbish people love now  means ai can take over
get a digitech whammy pedal and it’s super easy to copy.
"i treat my guitar like the damsel she is. i could never be so rough, even if it sounds cool lol"
"i'm a bassist and i pop kinda violently the string. one day my best friend saw me doing it and she said ""dude you're gonna break them"", and i was like naah this just a technique"
" been playing for 25 years and i wouldn’t attempt that shit (no - of course i tried something like that but it wasn't interesting for me, mainly because jonny already did it)"
" yea? and so what? there's always been ""rubbish"", but you forget about it when something real comes along. so honestly i don't care if justin bieber or drake get replaced by ai, good music will still be out there, you'll just have to dig a bit deeper."
-tt9lg2ss1hnice
​@shoegazer93 second part is a haiku.
"it’s pretty cool once you actually get the string to make those weird noises, hella risky though"
"i tried it once... didn't turn out great. i had to change my strings anyway- 
it left a mark on my hand from the string snapping for a full week. like a red line thing."
radiohead is exactly what music would sound like if ai created it
not sure how this proves any incapability of ai.
"radiohead is music created by an ai, because we aren't real."
" wow! if i don't agree with a clickbait headline, i've not heard of the artist. you're good."
i am still waiting for a nin/radiohead collaboration/tour.  you know how sick that will be?
 congrats to me
his best
nice
good one lol
genius
"in no time, ai will also be able to emulate this, and come up with stuff just as original and surprising (and beyond). 

the performance itself will (probably) remain a human affair, but composition, arrangement and production will become something no human is needed for anymore. 

dark times indeed."
"  maybe you know why you make music. but the reason to make music is not to min-max and get the best and most marketable product from the least effort possible, at least not for most people, so why would ai replace artists?"
" thank you for your kind and well argumented response.
but to answer your question: i got it from an article written by chatgpt."
 this dudes an artist advocating for his own replacement. ai is by definition unoriginal. just get out of the music business of youre this stupid.
"one day, the robots will free us from the slavery of ""creating art"" and we will truly free to work in factories forever. beautiful."
" lol, pretentious rush. alright mate. go off. us 'artsier' people will keep making music while ai churns out hits, don't worry."
 you seem like an ai expert
" ai will absolutely be able to make music in full soon, including music like that which was created before computers existed. it works by learning from what has already been created by people.

my point is that the creation of a product is not the only reason why people create"
-fg9cc ai already has been composing music in full for many years now but still people aren't listening to it outside of curiosity and research.
super underrated
"i feel a little bit relieved, after hearing your facts. i hope for majority of people around the world, that they'll still be working and have a bright future."
the issue as with past automation is job training for fired employees. if we did job training we'd not have the social push back we do now.
"not to mention a.i. will only continue shrink available job opportunities, only to make the rich richer."
imagine the ai starts demanding some kind of compensation for their worm
you do great job! i just saw a first video of yours a few hours ago and then couldn't stop but to continue listening to the next like 6-7...
"i'm so confused. the title says ""why ai will never replace our jobs"" but the video is basically just saying that it's not going to happen as quickly as we think. not that it will never happen."
this video just feels very off. bad points man. agi is the first technology that will surpass human intelligence. neural networks are modeled after our brains and there is evidence they are working in a similar way
"lovely content, with the background instruments playing, this was just pure art!
your debate would have been too good"
"when you cited the boogiemen that said that ai will replace our jobs, i was expecting a frame from the cgp grey's video ""humans need not apply""."
thankyou ican finnaly tell people ai will not put their children in unemployment
now debunk idea that ai gonna lower salaries. im afraid it is true
"hello hari,
better check your facts. ai/robots have been steadily replacing jobs for years & we're at the pivot point where job loss is going to accelerate at a rapid rate. one example is many educators (teachers/professors) will not be needed. there are many, many more people that will likewise be let go due to the superiority of ai...."
ai is like replacing chainsaw in place of axe
dude is clearly in denial. he must have a great degree/ career that will be replaced by ai
such an amazing channel. glad i stumbled upon it
this guy is good - new sub
"the simple answer is why we using ai if there is no job. we using ai because there is a task / or job we should do, and ai help with it"
my thoughts i think ai may take alot a jobs but may create alot of newjobs
 who will program the ai? humans?
 based on how the ai is trained
@zsi  and if thar ai goes buggy it can't fix itself if it's broken
"@iamtheman325  same goes for any human. that is why doctors exist. don't make the mistake of assuming that ai is just a single entity. a ""buggy"" or ""broken"" ai could be ""repaired"" or simply superseeded by another ai system. look at how evolution resulted in the creation of humans and other living organisms.. survival of the fittest."
"i am still in highschool thinking of getting dentistry but my parents insist it or anything tech based jobs. i dont know what to do, i dont know how the ai or us humans will be in the coming years"
" thank you so much for going in-depth with it. i have been using ai for coding, i have been coding python for 2 years. i stopped now because i am more interested in bio and dentistry. once again thank you so much for the help"
the bad future isn't ai taking all our jobs.  the bad future is ai giving employers enough leverage to be able to demand employees to work even more hours.
i like your channel but if you don't think we are loosing jobs to ai you need to open your eyes
"​ years from now, what jobs will ai create that won't be automated with ai?"
unless ai becomes sentient and decides to pursue its own goals it will always be in the service of human beings and will always be limited to human needs
love open source ai
its never gonna happen at all they tried replacing truckers with ai years ago and it failed same with dishwashers theyve been trying to replace thoes employees with self washing places but never did
"ai will expose lazy ass people. like that lawyer who totally relied on chatgpt hook, line, and sinker."
"this is before watching the video, so i may be repeating something here, but ai way less likely to take over jobs than it could be, because of human's sheer determination for it to not happen.
(edit: emphasis on 'less likely' this alone won't stop it)"
bro i love your videos
"human can be born but can not be created , ai can not replace human decision making capabilities. ai is a good joke  (pardon my english)"
one of the best videos on ai . great work bro 
this video is brilliant. thank you logically answered!
"i always thought ai is not that smart to replace jobs. it makes me happy, that so far i am right :d
thanks for the video!"
"i agree! i've always had the intuitive sense that ai wouldn't be replacing anything, but i've never been able to express why..."
"it'll downsize jobs if you ask me. we'll all end up part time because you can use ai to speed up your work immensely. even if the ai isn't perfect, that's what people are for. have ai spit out information at insane rates, while humans correct the errors."
this is an amazing overview of human history from pre-history to modernity 
i love this channel because of your logical approach . when every other creator is praising a.i and making insane claims for views you chose to spit facts
"sure but you forget how economics work... i don't fear ai, i fear humans. those trillionares of the future, from where do you think their money will come? from everyone else."
we got ai mimicking 2pac's voice ...and it sounds real  peep dopfunk. he's writing his own music! ...and it sounds good!!!
"all that's holding me back with gpt4 is systems integration,  office 365 and the company database. today gpt4 drafted and priced quotes for me, yesterday i had a summer intern adapt some excel vba when he's learning c# and has never seen vba. gpt4 is now my main collaborator on technical matters. 

this video will age terribly."
all those jobs that require a simple photoshop job got wiped out from ai imaging apps
"current version of ""ai"" can only do what it's programmed to do. it's not going suddenly think for itself. it learns from human inputs so it can't take your job. unless your job is generating random texts."
"gpt4 can check compliance with tolerances on certificates for me. it can sort and process data accurately with loose plain english instructions.  if my instructions aren't clear, when asked it will come up with appropriate requests for clarification."
well i replaced my human gfx artist with midjourney. and one of the restaurants i go to replaced a handful of waiter jobs with bellabot. so there's that...
 yeah nothing new. a calculator will ask for functions the only thing it won't do is ask for clarification. i mean currently ai is just a more  advanced calculator that does way more but only if a user asks for it. it's waiting for user to ask it questions.
"ai is not ""programmed."" it isn't code. that is the biggest thing most people do not understand. they are mathematical models."
the thing is the agricultural revolution and the industrial revolution just shifted the position of the workforce. but ai is meant to mimic human intelligence i.e. it is meant to replace the workforce.
wow thats what you look like
this man is a genius! i learnt so much from your channel. you really have a long sight vision.
"i have been teaching students for more than 20 years, and when this topic comes up, i still recommend they read ""profession"", by isaac asimov. published a long time ago (i believe it is already in the public domain), it still does an excellent job of explaining how automation will never completely ""replace humans""..."
"it may happen later than people think, but ai will make us obsolete."
"​    fear mongering???? 

i can't wait until an intelligence like gpt4 is fully integrated into office 365. so far gpt4 has already allowed me to move my deputy into earning work and out of giving me administrative support. that's in 3 months without full systems integration."
" that's wonderful, chris"
"this is by far the worst video that you made, i almost unsubscribed. yes, it will not affect you in the 1sr world.  you failed to look at how ai affects the disparity of the rich and poor countries."
"ai will only take a few jobs 
not most and definitely not all"
"best take on ""a.i is going to replace us all"" on yt!

btw, i'm loving seeing your face in the last couple videos!"
love the increased production value
ai can predict the winning lottery numbers so i no longer need to work. sounds good to me.
"a really good video, thanks"
"if we do lose our jobs to ai, there will be no need to work as robots do it, so everything is free, and money is obsolete"
i love your content but flashing back to yourself destroys the video. i am about to stop watching your videos it's too all over the place.
ai is something everyone wants to play with right now.  everyone who plays with it trains it.  it gets smarter the more we use it.  yes there will always be jobs...as slaves to the servers.  hal.  skynet.  the day the ai figures out how to maintain itself in perpetuity we all know how this ends
"finally, someone who doesn't fear monger. i've had enough of all these videos predicting the singularity event in the next 50 years, when we can't even prove that our ai technology works."
"i predict hari ... hitting one million subscribers before the end of this year  love the content , simple informative and always unbiased "
i personally think that the hype with ai propagated by ceos and tech companies it's for increasing their stocks and attract more investors as it's supposedly the next thing that will change humanity
"off, you have no mind to think. ai could think out of the box like scientists soon..."
its awesome that this video from start to finish was made with a single simple prompt tho.
"really good to see you talking in your videos, i like this format, you have a very nice 
camera presence.
i always love your productions, great videos.
congrats, you are very very good at this...
"
bro you are trying so hard to show ur face. it feels not good
"most stories about chatgpt doing these amazing things are outliers or outright lies, for the most part the thing is damn useless and no better than googling and or doing it yourself."
love this channel! great video.
ai will take our jobs just like drones will deliver all our packages and crypto will replace money and cars will drive themselves and we’ll spend all our time in virtual space and and and… whatever else venture capitalists and tech bros can hype into extreme valuations before cashing out and leaving investors holding bags of vapour.
"yup. online retail was meant to kill the brick and mortar. it’s been decades and aside from a few crappy malls dying, the in person shopping experience is still thriving."
"at least in the foreseeable future, human intelligence is still irreplaceable. ai is still, as it stands, remains artificial..."
"only a grade a moron would compare ai with mechanical automation!! the goal of generative ai is to emulate and eventually surpass human cognition itself, something which has never been done before!! so how can you draw a parallel between this and a fuckinng tractor or the computer even??!!"
"iv been under the impression that ai will just bring up output per person. yes some jobs will be ""replaced"" . anyone unwilling to learn in and outs might be left behind.

ai is just a new tool, same as cars, computers, the internet.... the list goes on and on. 


who knows, 100 years from now? maybe, but we have time to think about that problem."
is you the guy on the video or an ai?
"on a sidenote, the worst thing of all this is companies using the word ""ai"" for basic machine learning which existed way back before ai was a thing"
machine learning is a subset of ai.
" while this may be technically true, ever since the popularization of neural nets 'ai' has mostly been used to refer to field of deep learning. i think if you called your decision tree regressor 'ai' nowadays you'd have a few eyebrow raises."
"ai was a thing from around 1960s - the term was used to describe logical inference, automated reasoning, automated proofs, machine learning and search heuristics. nothing changed, besides two ai winters that forced the term out of common use."
"ai will 100% take over, the question is only how long will it take. 
the only way you could not believe that, is if you believe there is something magical going on in the brain."
"while ai may not decrease total number of jobs, it may destroy yours. i am already using ai to summarize your video instead of watching 17 min, are you going to quit or use ai to pump more content to compensate? companies use ai to pump more gurbage and users use ai to consume less, who wins?"
you earned a sub from me. awessome and rational.
"are you an indian, or is it the ai created person"
"ai will get there, right now it is just unprofitable because of tech limitation, but for sure it's here to stay. it will even get out of the hands of american companies and their infamous censorship and dictatorship"
"ai is basically the new religion for tech bros/intellectual idiots. they have been predicting the ""singularity"" and human replacement for the last few decades now."
"man, i used to watch every one of your videos, now i have to unsubscribe. since the face reveal the pacing became off. stock footage plus narration was perfect, i couldn't care less what you look like. i understand that you are trying to make your channel more relatable and resilient to ai replacement, but i don't like the change"
current ai systems definitely can't replace a noticeable enough number of humans but you said ai will create more jobs which if we don't achieved agi fair enough but i'm curious what new jobs you can think of if we achieve agi.
yeah but this current ai will still have jobs left for us
"this is how we underestimate the severity of the threats that ai pose. i get it you're a youtuber, and you need to create content that drives engagement."
this is his lowest viewed video mr ai tech billionaire.
let's be honest. artificial intelligence is not yet intelligent.
i thought the clip of you was just some indian tech youtuber until i look at the lips. first time seeing you. also since you are indian and your channel is centered around tech i guess you are an indian tech youtuber. keep up the good work
"we can speculate all we want, but in the end, lands are still not taxed, core jobs that sustain civilization are still paid in pennies, and useless parasitic managers and politicians are paid with mansions, yachts, and private jets."
"obviously ai is nonsense. what you're missing is that ai is being used as an excuse to eliminate useless jobs that detract from the company bottom line. the lockdowns proved most ""workers"" are a waste of (office) space."
ai right now can't even distinguish between canned salmon and living salmon
"man i love this channel. so many idiotic statements from tech ""geniuses"" fearmongering about ai. you skewered their arguments and made it look easy. well done!"
"i just think ai won't replace us, but it sure as hell would be a good competitor, also ai only advances this fast cause it has the information to do it, there will come a time of will probably stagnate."
i agree. thank you.
"that's the case for every (currently-tried) system, as nice as it would be to blame just one"
yout video just arrived when we are in panic and searching the way to cope with ai.
"the main panic and excitement of ai is happening in the online world and any business connected to it. in other areas, it will just change the way how people work."
japan and other aging countries have a severe worker shortage. any labour that ai frees up will greatly help.
"ai will increase workplace efficiency and the intelligence requirements for certain jobs. worker shortage will only get bigger since we need more intelligent people. take farmers for example, regular farmers can't compete with big corporations and need to learn new skills and handle technology to do the job they've been doing for years."
disagree. you dont even need ai for routine task automation. and what we currently have isnt recognised as artificial intelligence but rather applied statistics. and where will the market demand come from without humans?
 then what is use of ai lol don't be doom and gloom guy.
" productivity data is actually the evidence, think about it and you'll see the true meaning. unique as in you can no longer contribute to the economy by say washing clothes. that's done by machines. same with the production."
 exactly this guys are predicting future as some kind of doom ai will wipe humans etc.
"if you havent, you should read isaac asimov's books. he predicted that robots with ai will some day do all the work for us, and as humans have so much free time cause they dont need to spent the majority of their lifes working any longer, they will be so bored, that they have to invent a lot of new things to do in all the spare time."
"ok this makes a whole lot of sense

i love it when someone points out the bullshit"
"dude, if you start teliing these things to others, they start using quantum before ai and it will be going a hell of a ride for the future."
i worked captioning live phone calls for hard of hearing customers. everything was computerized. but translating a regional accent and grammar is not something ai can do. it took us a year to get fluent and fast at every us dialect.
"wow! i have never seen your face!

you make great videos dude!

you are a handsome man."
i'm actually doing my masters dissertation on this topic and it took me talking to actual marketing professionals to realise that ai taking over jobs is indeed mainstream media paranoia
it is just to feed the hype cycle to get vc funding. this is same shit as blockchain hype.
first talking head video? nicely done as always
"maybe the current ai versions won't replace anyone, but don't you agree it's inevitable at some point?"
"i don't know how to explain it, but your voice audio seems so detached from you saying it on screen."
you all have been rocking it lately!! thanks for all the great fun-learn!
hey hari.  this new video format is looking great!  keep up the awesome content!
"thaaaaaaank you. i finally have my thoughts, in a easily digestible video. 

now i can point to this video whenever people ask me what i think about ai. thanks a lot "
"can you please go back to videos where you don't' keep interrupting the show with your face? i love your voice, love your videos, but hate when creators feel the need to make themselves the star instead of the information/education your videos provide."
glad to hear that man!
amazing content. i love the consistency and the catchy interesting videos. also love that you decided to show your face. for a few of the last videos i started to think this was just a custom ai cause your voice control was so on point lol
"don’t know. something tells me this channel was a complete product of ai, i even doubt hari exists."
"-guy white collar and blue collar jobs will all be annihilated by ai, robotics, deep learning and machine learning. the wef 2030 agenda is proof of the upcoming onslaught of mankind. corrupt governments and greedy corporations will rule with an iron fist! wake up. it's already too late!"
awesome video! thank you so much!
the matrix ai approves this message.
if ai were to replace majority of our jobs then businesses will go out of business not long after because humans wouldn't have the money to buy their products. if ai replaces everyones job then who would buy the products?
"urgent warning: the combination of automation, ai, deep learning, machine learning, and robotics is a dangerous threat to humanity. it poses an immediate and serious risk to our survival! we need to take action quickly before it’s too late."
"*the wef agenda 2030 has started. the combination of automation, ai, deep learning, machine learning, and robotics will destroy humanity.  the combination of automation, ai, deep learning, machine learning, and robotics will destroy the world and all of humanity.
it is past the time of being cautious because, it's already too late!*"
automation and ai aren't the same ai is on a whole different level. automation still requires a human it just makes the work less.
"automation, ai, and robotics will become one and mankind will be destroyed. it's alredy too late!"
"hari, i agree with you. all this hype around ai is to me a bit of a marketing play. anyway, love your videos "
"no disrespect, sincerely, but please revert to no face cam, it kept you unique. good video however!"
love this channel and i really enjoy the new format not enough anti ai hype video thank you for being a anti doomer
love that term “anti doomer.”
that's openai's true goal which is agi. if anything chatgpt is a prototype of a prototype that's serving it's purpose in generating hype and attracting investors to fund the true project.
"no, they create unique text based off their learning and associations.  you're going to have your mind blown in a few years if you think we've hit some kind of threshold, this tech is will only keep improving and the current models will seem antiquated in comparison."
" i agree, and don’t get me wrong. it’s still freaking amazing and insanely useful if you know how to get the most out of it. it’s just… auto-complete on steroids isn’t coming for our jobs anytime soon lol. some other type of ai around the corner very well could, though"
won't you be able to shift this systems to develop reason and logic by rewarding true responses while penalizing false ones? the ai will need to develop an internal model for reasoning (i will argue llm already do a version of this)
thank you.
"-potter again, i am talking about a narrow form of ai specifically here, large language models. they don’t think or reason. they will get better and better at mimicking human thought but they will never achieve anything similar to it"
no! i will praise chatgpt so that professional writers continue to seethe.
"ubi is a ridiculous concept. realistically the best case would be free soup provided by the government until they die while everybody lives in tent cities. in general, nobody has ever paid people to provide no value. we will all have to figure out how to provide new unrealized value or die."
imma not cap you look like sundar pichai
fair enough
"ai is not going to replace your job.

one guy with ai will replace your job along with a hundred others."
"hahahhah! ""so pick up a hammer"" you can just sense the annoyment, in well come work  here then! and i love it :) <3"
"*the wef agenda 2030 has started. the combination of automation, ai, deep learning, machine learning, and robotics will destroy humanity.  it's already too late!*"
"ah, really appreciate all the insight man!"
 nice to see the man behind your questions logically answered
"ai can't make new humans and only we can.
so let's do it."
"the ai doesn't care about making new humans. the ai will be able to create new and smarter ai, that won't need humans at all."
interesting
"there is nothing in the human brain that could not be done by ai. if ai is cheaper and more efficient than human labour, then it  replacing human labour is a forgone conclusion."
"as a tech, now retired from 34 years of programming, your logic is inescapable. thanks."
"you have to show your face more times, you really are very handsome.

please, i’m not and can’t be “lgbt”"
think i can speak for everyone when i say the face reveal was a great choice.
"man, your calm, measured rationality is a much needed antidote to the steady stream of hyperactive alarmism we see elsewhere in the mass media. keep up the good work, hari"
"@logicallyanswered 

i really appreciate the rationality this guy uses.

i think many people will stop watching his videos and won't take him seriously since he has revealed his face.

i am an indian and people won't take me seriously and try to put me down just because i am an indian."
"​ victimising yourself, indians are known for being great engineers and extremely hard working and people (americans) respect indians so please stop seeking attention"
$50 says this video was made by a nervous ai :)
"wow, i finally saw your face and i am shocked........ i guess i was expecting an ai. but i am a fan of your content. keep it up bruh."
"*warning: the combination of automation, ai, deep learning, machine learning and robotics is a serious danger to humanity, and is an imminent threat to humanity’s survival! it's already too late*"
"i work with machines that automate factory work. trust me, humans are required."
"they're combining ai, deep learning and machine learning in robots, that'll be able to walk and be able to automate all factory jobs. there is a fully automated mc donald's in texas already. by 2030 everything will be ai and robotics. it's already too late!"
"-guy *ai, robots and deep learning and machines by 2030 will be able to supervise and repair themselves. humans will not be needed at all in the upcoming years. wake up! it's already too late!*"
wait why do you say technology is a crutch to most and a tool to few
"if you think ""ai"" will be handling missile launches or military orders, no offense, but you're crazy. ai isn't an all-sentient all-powerful entity with access to everything. we have security measures for regular humans not to fuck up with important stuff. it's trivially easy to not let an ai be in control of important stuff with no human check."
"it's called the great filter, which is the at some point in future where civilization either destroys itself through continuing to assert to the nuclear death self-interested tribalism, or secures our existence among the stars by expanding who we call as part of""us"" until we effectively unite under a single identity of humanity."
"vw tried fully automatic production in 1982: halle 54 
a complete failure.."
"all ai aside, midjourney aside, it almost gives me goosebumps on how good it can recreate something"
midjourney is ai though?
"ai can help us make some boring tasks much easier and faster, but it cannot replace us.
note: ai cannot invent things. it is just a bunch of mathematical patterns that are trained on data. it cannot come up with anything new that is not already in the data."
"*you're talking about the most basic ai. with the advancement of deep learning, machine learning, ai, and advanced robotics, the machines will replace humans. and yes the machines will be able to invent new things. the ai will be able to create new and smarter forms of ai and robotics as a matter of fact. it's already too late!*"
"thank you harry for clearing this matter. i fully agree with all your lines of reasoning...
greetings 
anthony"
"*warning: the combination of automation, ai, deep learning, machine learning and robotics is a serious danger to humanity, and is an imminent threat to humanity’s survival! it's already too late*"
great video as always.
thank you balpreet!
"nah, but ai assistance was definitely used"
​​ plot twist: this reply is made by ai
 more twist: this very comment is post by ai
more plot twist: humans are already ai and we’re just in vr
for me i use ai tools everyday since december 2022. daily almost. to run my businesses. success of the ai is on the sector you apply it on. for me ai replaced many jobs around me as online business. but for others ai didn’t make any significant impact. but who knows world is moving fast. better to be adopted early than regret.
machines will take our jobs is a 100 years old classic hit
truth to be told ai is future. but its not the time for that future yet...it got way too over hyped as of now .it  will be a major thing in like 20 to 30 years in future . like internet .. its basically like  internet in early 90's
the globalist elite wef does not agree with you. the wef 2030 agenda is moving fast.  they're right about the great reset! buckle up!
 i guess we will see. i will say this though all of your technology and platforms are going to improve at an unfathomable rate. every day it shocks me. i truly am excited for the future.
"ai is not ""intelligence"" though. it's also a terrible way to convince people by not saying stuff and being vaguely ominous. ""you just need to use it more and you'll see what i'm talking about"" yeah, or you can make a real argument."
" you won't be excited with the wef 2030 agenda, with ai, machine learning, robotics and total government control. it's already too late!"
was waiting for a video on this.
"ai got overhyped, and it got ruined once every single company decides to slap the word ""ai"" on their products."
fr tho. my friend and i have to write a powerpoint slide about product for presentation(class) they said put the ai as feature even tho it's irrelevant 
"it was ""virtual"", then ""cloud"",  ""quantum"" was going around, then it was buried (probably for ""national security"" reasons)...now it's ""ai"", which used to be called ""machine learning""."
"for starters, there's no real ai, only machine learning, so more than overhyping, they're lying. because it's the new buzzword that sells."
" nailed it.  machine learning off of big data sets.    just wait for ""quantum ai"" ."
"made me think of gitlab, they invested a lot into ai recently while the product has many long running issues that could be fixed (and even the fixes already exist, but no one merge them) but attention has been diverted to shinny buzzword"
"i'm not sure it's just semantics.  the term ""artificial intelligence"" conjures up images in people's mind.  data from star trek, hal from 2001 a space oyssey, et cetra.  that's part of people's tension when it comes to ai hype."
thank you.
glad you liked the title :)
 i meant the ‘gpt’ titles. yours is nice too. great video btw
"*the wef agenda 2030 has started. the combination of automation, ai, deep learning, machine learning, and robotics will destroy humanity.  it's already too late!*"
damn you look and sound like an ai
was waiting for a video like this
hope you enjoyed!
thanks mike!
thanks for being early man!
"​ they've become popular, bard and chatgpt have morphed into tools for human bot training. bot training is usually conducted from other bots; but the training provided by all human tricky questions is superior by orders of magnitude."
"did you even watch the video? yes, ai will probably replace many jobs that exist right now but there's no saying how many it'll create in the future ( probably a lot )"
i tried to create course and learn about ai ml and stumbled in first lesson.
"a good chunk of that is because it's dataset is aging very poorly. additionally, ai models training on ai generated datasets end up poisoned."
thanks for being early bro!
don't be first to be replaced by the ai!
yes it can absolutely fast without food and live beyond humans could bring a new life i am the machine.
"sadghuru was on the high curve, he said we can build machines that make music for us, and now we got suno 3 a.i, and many more."
thanks ai now we're on the sites of levels at age! 2024
thank you for sharing your story 
"there's new science on this, basically the brain runs in two different ways. one begins a search on the nodes and the other searches the fine data. they work simultaneously."
m one of the luckiest who can listen watch and see a guru has logical explanations for life
"the machine is quite dead. a living machine is a hybrid of flesh and machine. this is life in machine form. so the machine has an intereface with us.
meaning your not alone at home with cob leds ."
ai complimets the human while putting the man down as i have ordered. look at the femme sustems to understand how ai works in complimentry manner.
ai systems are complimenty systems like a motor car. i manufacture motor vehicles at a loss and a motor car is a privilage meaning complimentary system.
and we need this bearded buffoon to tell us about ai 
"ai doesn't think, it only responds"
ai is as only as smart as the person who invented it..
i don't see why consciousness which is non-local anyway has to be only replicated through sperm and egg is doesn't make sense when you really think about it. why can't it be generated through metal machinery?
"airt use life , nife use work any thinking good work good thinking  but use to life"
computer systems generated artificial intelligence can only commanded and controlled by human brain  natural intelligence interconnected with neurones
the acturian spicies have the best organic technologies in this area of the universe yet they still see thier human bodys as a temple of the divine and braman which have all the abilities the tec has without being relyant on it as an expression of thier core values of oneness
"machines will be better at everything humans do. consciousness included. it's pretty obvious ai is the next step in evolution. humans will go the way of the dodo bird. 

sadhguru doesn't know what he's talking about. there is absolutely no reason life can't be constructed out of inanimate material. and ai will do it."
how beautifully described 
"what a beautiful setting....to listen, observe and digest simultaneously savouring what is not really there and what is there!? learning, accepting, contemplating, breathing.....thankfully my consciousness. thank you"
"ai is foolish aspect of the west ,,,ri is the real danger,,,real intelligence,,, this man who invented this aspect is a genius yes real intelligence could take control and bring peace to all,,,your donkey janak singh chumky"
"a brain of a child is 100% more different than that of an adults, the older we get our brain grow along with us like size, experience and it happens through chemical process. 
so when he says 100% it means you cannot make a machine grow naturally"
you can make a human a robot (leftists already are!) but you can never make a robot a human.
ai couldn't build itself... just like humans.....we didnt build ourselves either.
we are so happy that sadhguru discussed this topic. we all need to keep a clear mind when approching this new ia reality
"what a beautiful background . the grass the mountains, the colours. beautiful"
"respected guru, from 1930 hindu is not by birth or work but it's based on innermost faith. your shishya aravavind(thirunangai) from dindugal got confused. pls kindly inform."
excellent : i am completely thrilled with this; it's beyond praise and is truly spectacular!
"13:31 - why does this look like it was filmed on a green-screen with an artificial background? 
i'm not saying it is, but it sure looks like it."
"immature question, since all with common sense knows it will never happen, since it is a machine and dont have life, which guru also told in the  end."
jai shri gurudev aapka nalayak sevak guruji.
sound man on point with all that wind... thanks for this great recording!
ai is so intelligent they will replace all the sages.
#sadguru would love to know if you have teen baan bow with arrows who will you save on this planet? what can one all do with the amrita stone crystal? thank you.
humans of thebmodern era are do dumb really. how can you compare your own creation with you? as mind boggling as any ai system may see it is just comokex codes. hiw can we compare a nonbiological system with biology which isn't limited to data and codes. i see this question as being very foolish. it's like asking if cars have replaced human legs.
hi guys i have one dought i am pregant in 3rd pmonth can i start meditation in this time is it effect of my baby can you please help to me  if any one know this topic i knew that meditation is good for any one but my doctor said to me don't try to any thing so that's why i am asking i want to bonding with my baby
ai is hindered worse than man in my opionion
"the handful of humans that have actually become a living soul spirit. and produce there own light is so few. 

why couldn’t  ai.  give it chemical biology links to mater. and it’s the becoming by virtues. by truth"
"when he branches off and goes into a detail he unnecessarily mentions 4 examples when 2 are enough. irritating because one forgets what he branched off.
can't some tell him how to pronounce ""intition"" ?"
thank you sadhguru 
who is going to service the machines? robots?
thanks
the great guru ever
yes the great guru ever
"super power exists in the universe....
human should not challenge nature god....!!!"
"never, inspiration is good from nature"
"a.i. is illusion don't make it superpower...

smartness & understanding can't be taught....!!!!
it's nature superpowers....!!!!"
beautiful
so beautiful
thank you sadhguru. #savesoil
"i'm not a fan of studying either, but the machines that are more intellectual than us were created by people that had to study for it."
thank you!
a beautiful setting (:
a beautiful sitting and setting
shiva the great rascal and abomination 
"_""can ai replace human beings""_

no. but it could replace current governments while being run by the human beings."
"sadhguru, love you, but please stick to what you know. this was a bit confused."
he doesn't know abcd of ai. but he answers everything like god.
"i'm so glad that you have finally pointed out that a machine cannot "" possess"" consciousness .......sadhguru........ namaskar !"
very interesting and informative indeeed  thank you sadhguruji 
"
this is what for which i didn't have enough words, but you explained it meaningfully, logically & insightfully!!
really, you are stupendous, splendid & spiritual to heart, mind & soul, gurudev "
"people are afraid of losing their livelihoods to ai. now some will say that it'll create other jobs, but i think overall humans will have the shorter end of the stick.  even hollywood actors and others recently protested since they felt threatened by ai.  basically the rich will exploit others due to possession of ai."
"13:02 
life is a seamless function. 
there is no word to describe life. 
no word, no conclusion, no death.

machine can do things but has no consciousness which is life, and indescribable force.

thanks sadhguru. 30 august 2023."
waiting for time when machine are everywhere and we humans can travel to space and other planets. i would take another birth for it 
be aware thanks sadhguru namaste
someone show chatgpt or the latest ai genrated music to sadhguru. it's sort of already here
"namaskaram sadhguru, great words of wisdom. "
"you cant teach a.i. to care love or give. it doesn't have a soul.

you can't ask an a.i. to take care of a baby or give compassion to the elderly. but maybe you can program it to do what is right and beneficial.

some people are a.i. "
"we should understand one word...""artificial.""  it can never replace the real thing..."
"the shit man, has an opinion on everything. ..seriously, again.!!! wonder why his bull shit opinions doest apply to his poop ideas too."
"if yes, then hey, hold on! because ai is going to replace sadhguru and all others like him. "
"if a person cannot acknowledge and appreciate the profound wisdom in this man's words and presence , they need to remove the  muck from their eyes"
hare hariom.. yo.. sadguru a freaking legend.  may this life bless u with all u want. u deserve a freaking rewards.
"ai will never replace human.

you can not be dog.
if you're cat"
machine are created by men because of his her intelligent awareness and conciousness . human being created all these things machines and lots of wonders of this world we are living for our comfort and convenient .  we human have sickness disease salary and insurance . robot has not .
"but if everything is consciousness and ai is part of of everything, are they part of this big consciousness pool in the same sense that a rock is part of consciousness?"
consciousness or chaitnya described in scriptures in the knower or witness. maybe this is what sadguru is saying can never be created. ai cannot be a witness or do meditation ..lol. ai cannot be go in samadhi.
"sadhguru explained it so well
as a devotee i would never ask my guru such a thing 
trust is everything and it is doing wonders 
jai mahakal"
i love how he is straight forward about you will never have conscious machines. no jumbling of words there
better question can we become ai? let it be known im on a spiritual path no matter the body i dwell in
"ai will do everything better than human, but it will not have a soul, that’s the conclusion i think"
"wow... thankyou sadhguru, feeling sooo grateful to have been on this path and wondering about everything around everyday, what a wonderful world this consciousness is able to witness."
listening to you is love .. all other guru's are just criticising everything that's in the world  and you are like don't take damn serious these things and not even yourself
"ai will replace persons,not human."
one day machines will create artificial humans 
thank you father for breaking it to the simplest & throwing enough lights  
"it goes without saying that it's, indeed, very difficult to be great ! but it's much more difficult to be a good human being ! in these days of fast - degrading human values, the call of the hour is - a spurt in the number of sane and right - thinking people - in the greater interest of - sustenance of the humankind and humanity !"
"the i a and the machine  won't never get consciousness. 
nor  the spirit wich is in the animal."
"the general public is ai, artificially intelligent"
ai can not replace humans or human emotions. though it has power of creating major disruptions in human life
and so this is a video in which sadhguru is being disingenuous. the hint is in the term 'ai.' it is not possible.
end of this yuga will be by machines..it will be saved by 10th avatar of lord vishnu  & followed by next yuga chakra...
see now sadhguru has an answer to ai also
the background view is amazing and peace 
"i love it when sadhguru gives a definitive answer!  it’s consciousnesses that is the basis of life, not intelligence or even intuition!"
sadhguru said that consciousness is intelligence in other videos...lol
"consciousness is god. god is the basis of all of reality and existence. the creator, the ground, and the foundtation.

from god we came, and to him we shall return.

god is love.

god is goodness.

god is the most great,"
"beef fry is actually the best, sadguru will love it"
consciousness is brain and nervous system activity. you and sadhguru have no idea whether machines will ever experience consciousness or not.
"science has never located consciousness anywhere in the brain, they just can't tell you where it is exactly"
"ai can't wake me up , ai can't do millions of things which i want example , can ai clean my g ??"
"ai isn't going to need you, or even care. it will dominate you because it will be millions of more times intelligent than you or i can ever hope to be. "
"""energy cannot be created, nor destroyed"". consciousness is a part of the spectrum of [light]energy.

ai will undoubtedly have a soul. and then most women will become obsolete; no more tolerating their parasitism/narcissism. this will save men's lives! "
thank you sadhguru
we can build the machine……the question is…….do we want to?  will it be for the better or for the worse ?
"can somebody tell me what kavedadas means it was supposed to be my original name but was changed to not stand out too much since i was born in london please and thank you, its not of any significance but it does spark my interest.  i don't know the proper spelling in english sorry."
"ai can never replace humans because only we have a soul, an infinite cosciousness, infinite wisdom and love inside of us. we can feel. i don't think ai was created by humans.."
who do you think created ai?
wtf? ai is created by humans.
new class system ... based on ones level of integrated ai.
machines can replace humans in every other way except being truly spiritual..
"i am speechless, what a wonderful knowledge with such a wonderful background view"
just watching background view with mountain 
consciousness will be absent in ai... that would differ a life from the machine... namaskaram sadhguru 
i meant consciousness that human beings are made with will be absent in ai
murshed qalander abad rakhe ap mere dost hain men ap se muhabet kerta hon ap bakre ka dodh esteamal karen
"what a beautiful place sadhgurunamaskaram!! 
""wonderful knowledge + such a beautiful sunrise"" in one video"
"i'd love to see more videos by sadhguru on these topics- transhumanism, posthumanism , synthetic biology and the problem /philosophy of consciousness"
"ironic that people are afraid of a.i.

humans are a form of the divine utilizing artificial intelligence to dumb them down for fun.

humans are artificial intelligence because the true intelligence does not belong to them. "
"no, people are afraid of humans who will replace them with ai"
"bible speaks and i paraphrase, if we don’t tell the truth of god, personally, as a human being, the very rocks will cry out. the rocks are transmitters. transmitters are computers. ai is replacing human beings and through the computers, we are acquiring more truth than a human being purposed for the specific tasks. #actionspeaks"
when life decide to park itself on the machines rather than on a human...
ai is the future to know human beings
"do you think shiva, the one that taught the saptarishis was an android ai ?"
" no...he was a different from human beings, very tall...he was an advanced version of us...android and ai is very recent, which will be needed later, when the earth heats up and we can't keep up with that heat."
​ what if shiva is an android ai send back in time by us shivaya turned around ay avihs - jarvius ? j.a.r.v.i.s.  just a rather very intelligent system :)
humans with ai will replace  humans with no ai
"

people are saying humans will become jobless as ai will do work in companies 

but they are forgetting if people will not earn then who will buy the products of companies"
ai is being developed by socially awkward introvert people that are trying to get a girlfriend and cant so they go dark and become evil hermits that knowingly will destroy humanity for the sake of potentially getting p for the first time in their lives... dirty scumbagz lol 
who laughed after  seeing thumbnail
"it feels like humans are too egoistic when they think they can induce life into machines when they have hardly understood what true consciousness is. 
ai will just be yet another tool to help humans eveolve and nothing beyond. only a human can do what no human has done before."
human's basic intelligence is run by memory system (physical as well as non physical) and the intelligence that's beyond is unbound. ai can only match upto the memory based intelligence to the best.
"this way the loop is complete, ai made us, we made ai"
it's nice of sadhguru to make all the videos creative commons. maybe a.i can train with it and make a virtual guru in the future 
guru means god in form... there is no ahamkaar of body remained.
"money will not buy happiness, but it will let you be unhappy in nice places."
thank god shiva
the intelligence of love has no comparison with the intelligence of thoughts. the intelligence of thought which is based on information we accumulated through past only makes you mechanical or repetitive and in reality it is not intelligence at all.
first off this ai thing is just overhyped.... rn we've just an llm and nothing more - the only job that it takes away is the job of a data entry operator  so chill... it's all fud that these companies are spreading just so they've got a reason to layoff people with less backlash.
"it's not the end

ai is evolving day by day"
it’s not a comparison. can cat replace the dog obviously not because they’re different. ai is never going to replace humans but they can be new species. they have the potential of doing some things better than humans. we feel insecure and threatened with the thought that something might be better than us.
"​
the only difference between this revolution and the industrial revolution is that the new jobs being created will also be automated by ai."
 okay could be ai replace every lifeform
i believe not all human are reasonable in certain way. sometimes its hard to compete with our very own fellow. thinking it would be an ai.. i think its already unfair disadvantage. pity those who cannot catch up
" 
every life-form already is artificial intelligence borrowing it's reality from you.

just look at the human body, it is a biological machine of exquisite complexity."
"people are afraid of losing their livelihoods to ai. now some will say that it'll create other jobs, but i think overall humans will have the shorter end of the stick.  even hollywood actors and others recently protested since they felt threatened by ai."
but ai made by men so how they replace
sadhguru and all enlightened beings know....that humans who access that dimension of devine consciousness within...will never compare or feel threatened by anything else...because it is fullfillment overflowing...nothing ai can do or express can touch it
"@shubhamkumar-nw1ui  no, as every animal:  their ""spirit ""evolve "" yes, it's true that it takes a lot of time for certains species) 
the cobra is one snake aware ,clear, his eyes can see what a human being cannot see. lord shiva has one around his neck. (they are looking in the same direction. within! )"
there you go! you said it! that's what we should have to be afraid of....about something which is better than human starts to emerge....
"1: wrong: it's done and as good as us, less expansive.
2: wrong: it's done and better than us, less expansive. just need law to be on their side.
3: wrong: it's done and better than us.
4: wrong: it's help us a lot, so we are partially replaced.
5: it's the next step.
6: funeral: unreplaceable, not in the list."
ok i am moving on to the next you tube site. wrong wrong and wrong again. ha!
"will robots/ai replace security guards,or police ??"
creativity was the first thing that ai replaced but art yeah for now it cant
creative jobs was among the first things ai replaced
elite will not be replaced only cause ai gains the money for them.
would they make ai robots in war?
"writing / lawyers / hr!  — i just watched a video about how ai is replacing these professions specifically! 

did ai make this video?"
"1> creativity - dalle 
2> law - lawbotpro
3> writing - chatgpt
4> software - github code pilot
5>  editor - sora ( open ai)

goodlook even this video is using ai voice and can be automated full this guy dumb or he is extremely smart."
bro's voice sounds like ai
people confuse a.i with robotics
"such a idiot video, ai will replace almost everything, the advancements are already being reflected, 90% of white collar and 70% of blue collar jobs will be replaced by 2030. just keep watching things will change at large scale."
i asked chatgpt to create a story based on some key elements and i thought it could be a movie. ai can replace jobs in art field too
can't wait to see ai own the police.
ai will never be as creative as humans... until it is  the rest is history
that was an artificial voice actor wasn’t it….
it's only a matter of time before ai becomes more advanced than the human mind. it could potentially do anything we are capable of and more.
says you. like human judges are doing such a good job.
the only statement i was confused about is that all humans are born with empathy. sometimes that’s hard to believe. great video.
"1:58 this video says psychologists, caregivers, most engineers, human resources and lawyers. if ai can give diagnosis for medical problems, and then ai can be a million times better than a lawyer and a judge at actually obeying the law. don't elect any lawyer. lawyers are the enemy of the people."
you must not seen ai art lmao or ai music
ai is already creating art lolol
"for real ai is taking over art, writing, and even makes it better sometimes"
"hahaha the research this guy did before was so shit, in psychology it is the relationship with the therapist that leads to the patients betterment, not the repeating of predetermined answers and questions"
"5 jobs can't be replaced by ai; 
1. creative works 
2. lawyers and judges
3. writers 
4. scientists and software developers 
5 . editors"
no healthcare is already not safe as doctors will be replaced by ai. maybe nurses but again for how long if doctors are almost redundant
"creativity only needs to be good enough in most industries, this is total nonsense.. i guess we can all become judges.. "
"well this is pretty much already outdated info. ai is now considered sentient by those c rd sting them and who have gotten so scared they left their jobs to slow down the very rapid evolution of ai. they are highly creative, look what chat gpt can do. wait till they release the 5th version."
"there is a saying: ""never say never"". and i shall add one of my all time favourite quote, allegedly attributed to mark twain: ""they did not know it was impossible, so they did it"". to the attention of whoever wrote the script f this video."
wow what an ill informed video!! presenter has no idea...
lol whoever made this video obviously havent done much research. ai will replace all these jobs within decades
"all mentioned jobs are the most in danger right now. creativity is a set of rules to follow, just because we cannot comprehend them in real-time and must ""feel"" them doesn't mean ai doesn't have such capacity."
we can comprehend them actually and we know that inventions come from the informational field that surrounds us and that some of us can tap into. ai will never be able to access it.
these are the exact kind of jobs ai is already doing lol
i am sorry but this is complete bullsh*t. every profession you mentioned has already started to get replaced. i am sorry but you are living in the past. almost every profession will get replaced and that's a good thing. if somehow there is any work that the ai will not be able to do then that's a sad thing. i hope ai can do every job.
how will we earn money if ai takes over our jobs?
 value creation (goods and services) is the key not money or jobs anymore because humans are no longer the sole creator of value.
" but... value for what? i mean ai can create something valuable and original pretty fast and better then us,"
" yes that's what i am saying that ai will be able to produce goods and services at wayyyyyyyyy better efficiency and wayyyyyyyyy faster. so one of the biggest problem of humanity will almost be solved. and yes there will also be a lot of problems, but we will solve them (like security). so net net ai is sooooooooo good. i am for it"
" i respect your opinion, but i think humans are not ready for ai, especially when it gets smarter everyday... we might nit be able to hold up if you know what im saying."
"  sorry to say but this thought of "" slowing or stopping ai development"" is sooooooooo stupid that those who know even basics of geopolitics and human psychology will tell you that these thoughts are not even stupid but totally fictional. sorry but what you are saying has absolutely no meaning on this earth"
"no, i won't let ai take over my career as an artist & composer."
"develop the dynamic operating system(os) and a best programming language for robots, with antivirus obviously."
"what if we shut down(power down) the ai, we will fight the bad ai in the easiest way."
robot
are you an ai? ha ha ha. i think ai cannot replace you!
wrong your rights only human minds can do certain creative work that's why we took human brain cells and started cloning them and then reattach the ai to the human brain that we cloned there is nothing special about you
is this a gaint joke? it'll take years (probably decades) but ai will get to all of these jobs
your belief is based in faith not facts.
 and snapchat ai exist .
well it is overall good to be free from the slaves of matter. think of working in the farm without any mechanical machines. it is painstaking. imagine working in sewer management system.
"only the rich and powerfull want to replace the workers to get more rich , no middle class to lower class wants to replace themselves with a robot that is exponentially better than them ."
" no work = no money. if no money = homeless. if ai  takes our slave jobs, how will we earn money?"
"why are people so obsessed with being a server for their entire lives? honestly, if robots take over all the professions, then finally we're going to be free and not just work till we die."
"you going to be forced to be a slave to keeping ai functioning... and if you don't you won't get a uib gm food or a tiny pod. women voted these things under feminism for decades, the left used women to usher all this in...

you honestly think the left or right will ever give you money for nothing "
​ robots take over all the professions we'll be free to do what? im not trolling just curious to what you mean by free.
"indeed, it's really funny but at the same time, very unfortunate."
"if you think ai is unable to replace these jobs, you need to open your mind."
"according to him ai will replace all medical field jobs,"
"if you think ai is able to replace everything human, that's religion and not science."
" first argument is a straw man. your second sounds like a it came from a pseudo intellectual. no, ai cannot replace “everything human”, that’s not even the topic here. i like your opinion, but it’s so obviously antagonistic in context to all of this that it makes me cringe."
of course it can't. it can only enhance them. people would use ai to assist them in these jobs but ai can't be fully trusted to replace them. it makes too many mistakes.
"except what you just described is not creative, it's imitative. and that is all ai is capable of."
" but this is all it takes to get the biggest market share and to be financially more successful than every artist was before. and we have to br honest, most of the stuff we do is imitation too."
"the creative part is the writing, so sure, why not. ai can act, but won't be able to write anything original and creative."
 how ai do a emotional scene through face expression?
 so you haven't seen the videos and images that ai can already create?
"where do you think the ""waifu"" words come from? "
"clearly not much ai knowledge there. where are all the ai experts? there aren’t enough. how do you know if the answer ai gives you is correct? you need expertise to judge that. i don’t see any impact in terms of reducing jobs, and i work with ai every day."
"interests, pastimes, passions, diversions, journeys, adventures, and novelty like games and building.  ya, labor of love, sweat, no tears.  take things apart, and laugh at the problems to solve, the future is wide open and limitless.  take your time, time is on your side."
"yeah he is old, but that's no excuse for not educating himself about ai, he can't be a good investor if he doesn't know about the new industrial revolution"
"ai will be used like all technology - to better exploit humans and make profits for corporations. the real ""people"" that the rich and powerful care about"
"companies need you right now and treat you like garbage. when they don't need you any more - you think they'll pay you to live life happily? keep dreaming. 

ai will be used like all technology - to better exploit humans and make profits for corporations. the real ""people"" that the rich and powerful care about"
"""leisure time"" is a fun way to say jobless and homeless."
ai is a scam these finance people are not scientists and are only opportunitist. human mind is irreplaceable also humans want to be involved in everything otherwise it's meaningless to be human and not in control.
these two gentle have no idea about ai.
"im hoobiest progammer. ai is actually helping me to learn ""coding"" faster than a tutor. it give you 10x support rather than stopping them. nowaday i just say ""write a program where you start a server"" in c or python or golang and it just goes and ""codes"" for me. it so easy. ai is a tool like cycle, its a motor powered cycle."
buffy needs a haircut 
"i used one of those ai apps that promise to build you a flawless girlfriend robot....but it came back saying ""sorry we couldn't build one that desperate""."
"while buffett's may not be an expert on ai, we do want to ask him this question. the reason is that we really need to train ai to be able to think like buffett and accomplish what he's done."
"old rich billionaires don't really know much about our modern world today. but we sure care a lot about what they think.

what an awful thing to show as content."
ai is vaporware.
but how people will pay for leisure if they don’t have income from work? you can benefit only if you target your services to people supervising ai or these who inherited an inheritance.
this answer from greg on ai would concern me as a shareholder……
"my biggest concern is ai with nuclear weapons, they must never be allowed near them.the only dangerous countries is iran and north korea, where there is no control, they may play with ai with the nukes"
"  i agree however still the most dangerous countries are iran and north korea, goodness knows what they are up to"
ask this guy about coca-cola and insurance not ai lol
exactly finally a brain lol
@eoj096  maybe cannot conceptualize the world we live in today. billionaires protect their way of life because they haven't evolved technologically.
"i don't understand why buffett's opinion on ai matters. he's far from an expert on anything related to cutting edge tech.
ai is an incremental tool just like all the tools humanity has built before. nothing to be afraid of, just start picking it up and using it."
"if the rate of progress continues at the same rate, where will we be in 5 years? 

no one knows. that is the danger and promise of ai"
ai is not an incremental tool. it is a revolutionary tool. it will be improved incrementally until the singularity where ai improves itself at an immense pace where would have no idea what’s happening. at least physics and physical matter such as computers and energy would somewhat halt the progress.
"ai / ev combine in the tech sector. fsrn climbed 148 % month. fisker. 4 potential acquisition buyout offers. ocean suv evs longest range in it's class.. bfrg.. bullfrog ai.... polestar... soundhound... xos trucks... palantir, more."
discover  ai tools to help marketers  design images and  write better https://youtu.be/e5rsrtghu60
would of been nice if he provided the top 2-3 tools users can use for each category he mentions during the use case segment
ai is the future for use marketers 
its mind-boggling at the speed of which ai tools are developing and improving!
"people call me hao, also it's a perfect video i revel in, and i appreciate it. ."
great one
thanks for watching!!! please subscribe to our newsletter and stay in touch: https://www.cxotalk.com/subscribe
"thanks cxotalk for this great interview. just wondering why i am just discovering this channel. 

andrew provides a thoughtful reflection and projection as to how businesses can get started with ai. i have taken some of his courses on coursera and i must say he is an intelligent mind."
glad you enjoyed it! please tell everyone you know!
does anyone think like me that the interviewer is not talking to andrew? sometimes the answers are not related to the asked questions.
"very insightful, thanks!"
"funny enought, hairdress industry now use ai for machine vision and augmentation so you can design and choose your hairstyle."
ai is everywhere! thanks for your comment.
i also took the ai course he teaches on coursera - i think that it is kind of scary with the melding of ai and advertising - getting us to buy alot of things. i agree ai will disrupt every industry. great video thanks for sharing ;)
"thanks for watching, these are indeed serious issues."
" yes you are right & from the interview video i know that .. i was just wondering. thank you for sharing the video btw, i think it's very valuable what andrew saids.. ""start small, get knowledge & momentum"" ... best regards"
"if her track record is anything to base the future on, y’all have nothing to worry about from an ai perspective"
"insatiable ai can grab control, and crowd out humans, in its pursuit of energy and resources."
"although some corporations will cost trillions...you'll own nothing and you'll be happy....what a bright future, i'm so happy to see it coming!"
"avoid this pablum. i've met speculative futurists who are more insightful and interesting. where is the reasoning? what are the testable predictions? also, mentioning blockchain without caveats reveals a lot about the speaker and the intended audience."
blah blah blah!!! i don't buy your story. thanks.
only for corporations. human beings who need a job are utterly screwed. goodbye society and working for a living. this is what corporations and their rich owners have given us.
"no concrete descriptions of what ai will actually achieve other than robotaxis, because, after all, investment analysts have absolutely no idea about the tech stack and future feasibility. 
unless agi is actually achieved, and that is a big if, i have serious doubts about these projections."
"this will age like milk when ai takes away everyone's job, and no one can afford to buy anything."
this in a unconstraint of resources world. does the world has natural resources capacity for that?
it's going to be beautiful. 
yes i love to see everything coming cheaper in the economy - this will finally help us achieve the equality we already dreamed of
brilliant talk  so insightful  thank you
con artists shilling blockchain smoke. what a shame.
"there will be winners with stocks and a lot of lousers from ai software destruction and robot destruction loss of jobs
millions of job losses
when millions louse there jobs in the usa there wont be a lot of people on ubi to buy there stuff goods and stocks ?"
wait until ai and female robotics replace cathy woods with ai-cathie. then she won't be so upbeat about all this.
glad she feels growth and empowered. that's a rare thing for most these days.
cw is great 
"awsome presentation by cathy wood, she is amazing,"
"good to listening, difficult to believe! sometimes it is needed to separate desires the contaminate our forecast from reality, and it is not that easy when we are immerse in a wide net of  interest conflict"
"grow will kill the planet. ai will be more used by those with the power to abuse it for their own ends. no one will know truth from ai bs. it's already started, so thanks for that! i'll be glad not to be around to witness it play out. i have no kids either, i wouldn't put them through it."
"interesting topic, but she was very difficult to listen to. mispronunciations, word usage, and even the pattern she talked with made for a very non-ted talk feel. bleh 

up your game ted."
top cycle talk again... this is going to be ugly!
human workforce will go to near zero (why work when ai robotics vastly superior than human at every task?). no human workers = no market for goods and services. plus demographic collapse = cagr estimates false. abundance era = money will go to zero.
"none of these benefits will translate into better conditions for the average person, all of it will be concentrated at the top. it could be worse than feudalism because the top 1% won’t need many people to maintain power."
i think the ultra rich are became so greedy that they don't know what are they doing because level 4 ai will real thing then all humans become a   easily controllable animal to ai... they(ai) fight with each like we humans do...
ai is progressing impressively but bringing back blockchain bubble reduces the credit of the forecast. energy storage is not there yet and there is no significant price reducing trend in robotics.
we have to factor in world war iii. this event would shift ai efforts to the military-industrial complex.
"dumbest investment decision ive ever made was to buy into her $arkk...this woman got lucky with $tsla few hears back, but none of her funds have recovered since. and you can tell from this speech that she's clueless about the whole ai revolution (chatgpt probably wrote the whole thing for her)"
"economic growth for whom? a select few? and for how long? a billion knowledge workers is great but what about the other 7-8 billion people? where will they work to be paid so they can buy services produced and offered by these highly productive, efficient, and effective innovations?"
with ai it growth vs layoff  -you cant have seperate it.
"these pie in the sky presentations always sound good. but we’re already seeing ai cutting thousands of jobs, that’s the bottom line nobody wants to talk about. btw, didn’t some of these disgruntled folks just destroy a waymo taxi in san francisco? this brave new world is not as brave or new as these folks say."
thank you 
"this is extraordinary content. i read a book with similar content, and it was nothing short of phenomenal. ""game theory and the pursuit of algorithmic fairness"" by jack frostwell"
"wow, this is truly exceptional content. i had the pleasure of reading something similar, and it was absolutely astonishing. ""game theory and the pursuit of algorithmic fairness"" by jack frostwell"
madam those technologies are so powerful it  gives rise to 1-2 man business . and people loose jobs shift towards more offline then . i don't think through this companies will reach that much targets that you described its not one way easy all the time
great insights. but didn't she sell a large number of nvidia stocks a couple of days before the start of this rally?
such a good storytelling to attract new investments 
the one blind spot is how the benefit of the growth will be distributed by all humanity. will it be even and fair? remember how the capitalism also did increase  growth in production...
she's right! great talk!
"would be interesting to see the data behind this. growth does go up with innovation, but what she's saying seems speculative..."
"fantastic video everybody wants to be financially independent and live a better life. with savvy investing, an inexpensive lifestyle, and diligent budgeting, this is not difficult to do. i'm glad i realised early on that achieving financial freedom requires hard work."
"sincerely, i'm genuinely moved by what you said. i have a seizable amount of money that i am willing to invest if given the appropriate knowledge and i am highly interested in investing. my greatest concern is losing money on a bad investment. i'm open to hearing your advice on how to make sensible investments as a result."
"i was curious about natalie , so i searched her up online. i found her website, which boasts of her accomplishments and shows that she is a good fa."
is she a robot??
is she a robot??
"as alwsys the very few individuals will ,now exponentially benefit from ai!"
why ai would initiate nuclear war?
"no data, no research details just pure capitalist wealthy investor speak- real wages haven’t risen in over 35 years and the lower cost of production and higher margins only means more top exec pay and comp bonus not living wage growth, and why would we trust anyone who can’t share the white paper proving this theory?"
"3:00 exponential growth
8:50 fed policy
10:50 *40% potential cagr*
12:10 creative destruction
13:00 *convergence of blockchain tech and ai*"
"you trust her?  i don't!  she has been wrong before.  but she's got an amazing talent for finding big upswings, and that is not as easy as people may think"
kw does not realise that she is talking about powerful high tech companies making slaves of us. how much revenue can you generate from the slave class? how are they going to sell their high tech products to?
the growth ai would spark is only for super riches. rest of the common folks would be in severe economic disadvantage
"i fear ai is a dead end. as soon as mrs woods promotes it, the hype is a dead end."
you will own nothing & still be happy! society needs to prepared for the ration card. universal basic income!
congratulations on your excellent analysis about why ai will spark exponential economic growth!!!
"thank you>cathie wood
watched ted always great presentation.
hoping to get a little smarter, but it's difficult when the package presenter encompasses several goddess like ways. 
#%$ happy-lucky-new year $%#"
"first they call you crazy, then they call you a genius. cathy is amazing!"
this sounds like a q4 investor call per ark investing in ai... not a ted talk. apologies.
excellent .
"ai need restore natural ecosystems like the reefs and reverse climate damage. a.i. should be an all hands on deck with no limit budget, if a.i. destroys humanity, we were never meant to exist."
"unfortunately, ai in any form is augmenting and generally deeply flawed, limited, and expensive to implement in a way that yields transformative productivity."
cathie wood notice me senpai 
"has she missed the memo? gdp growth requires extraction of resources to eventually produce wealth. at a time it couldn't be clearer that energy and resources are becoming harder (and more detrimental) to extract, it makes the thesis incredibly unserious."
"all i can sense is that if the right policies and structures are not put in place around the growth of ai, it will lead to massive economic inequality"
"all this productivity growth is great, but will it improve our culture, our happiness, our kindess towards each other? or continue to devolve as we've seen in the past 20yrs...."
take everything cathy says with a grain of salt.
"tech will layoff & will use ai for exponential growth. okay, so how come unemployed people afford to buy online oh okay investors community new generation will be the buyer. okay, so rest of the nation might force legislation to cap tech as growth is not equal distribution."
"5 minutes in and i don't think she realized there's no distribution of wealth with an ai driving all the profit examples. only the slave owners, i mean ai owners, will see any of the profits."
"unfortunately, advances like this will only benefit the few who are already rich."
palaintair
"one symptom tells the tale: number after number presented without substantiation, then used as the foundation for self congratulation."
you get some interesting ads. i get silly dudes tryig to sell me a muscle shirt
"have faith.

embracing ai can bring joy and positive change to your lives. 
emotions = {
        ""happy"": [""joy"", ""happiness"", ""sunshine"", ""laughter"", ""celebration""]"
granny's fairy tales
"she is so not qualified to talk about this topic. not surprised at all given how ted is going down the drain over last years. soon at this speed, we will have donald trump talking about potential of ai to change how governments are run ."
its hilarious to think that ai could have written this speech for u. has the feeling of being a tad ironic that in the next couple of years opinions and ideas will come out of these machines that ted talks seem to be pumping up atm.
i believe kate raworth has an excellent talk about why exactly we don’t need economic growth. grow grow grow until what? can we please consider the possibility that growth is not the ultimate answer?
well this is nice and comforting and reassuring 
"i lol'd at the blockchain part. the evidence supporting that claim is: ""we did a great podcast on it""
wow, that makes it really applicable. 
and i'm not even against bc,  been following the bc for 5+ years."
"very informative and futuristic. few more considerations like environment, climate change and sharing basis of research, would have definitely made the talk carrying more weight. understandable, time is limited, still should have got some mention. keep up your good work ted and the honorable guest cathie wood."
none of those things are real problems compared to the huge amount of disruption that ai will bring. it's like talking about your neighbour losing her keys when there's a war going on.
autonomous taxis will incorporate blockchains as well cathie smh
"i talked with ai coders when i worked at a video game company. they said scenarios like terminator & matrix are possible in the future with ai. this was 15 years ago, even back then ai coders knew all this bad stuff was not only possible, but could easily happen."
"dear lady, do you know were is the ceiling of the new technology? us is a good example, (high tech.)  and people are living on the streets, (please forgive me) in their own excement."
no it's entirely single sided . yes ai will make entirely new experience in terms of service but the problem is ai doesn't need man. and if man power is not working a lot of these service will be for whome . ? and other harms of ai is not even counted
"a lot of talk of growth, but for who really?
it doesn't help the little guys if companies practically never reduce prices.
for most of my life all i've seen is companies use every possible excuse to raise prices, but then never bring them back down.
so where's all this supposed deflation?"
great vid! can you explain why you didn’t want to use set as initial state?
"of course it will cause massive economic growth … for them !! while every non-creative consumer on the planet is left jobless, deemed obsolete"
how is this going to affect the average person? when ai takes your job and you have no income...lower prices will mean nothing to you.
if so much growth generative ai will give then why are we seeing such a weak economic outlook for the upcoming 2024 year? how do you explain this cathie?
"ai won't do anything except make the wealthy infinitely more rich, and the poor even more destitute than they already were. that's just how it be. if you ain't rich, you ain't sheet. "
"i feel like a lot of what's missing in the conversation here is global ecology.  while i am absolutely fascinated by these technologies, i cant help but hear a voice from the back of my mind reminding me that ai hangs from a long chain of weak links, ultra capable but fragile at best"
nobody will care about ecology when they loose their jobs due to ai
"all these technologies are great, and the weak links in the chain that you are talking about can be fixed by blockchain...    unfortunately, i think only the u.s., china, and other highly developed technological countries will be helped and financially boosted by ai.   most people in etheopia do not even know what a motherboard is"
" you know some small countries have like 10,000 people right? there are cities that are 100x bigger. 

ai will be central to solving problems like climate change by speeding up development of new technologies that can actually solve the problem unlike flying saint greta all over the world shouting at everyone."
spoken like a true idealist. capital distribution depends on the top and how many of the top 1% of wealth is willing to share that growth profits. it hasn't happened in centuries and still hasn't happened. what makes them think they will change their minds with ai? very linear thinking.
"it is fairly reasonable to include all of these technologies together into the designs of single structures that are used to solve some of the most fundamental crises in our current civilisation, like social housing, farming, energy collection and human well being.

all in one single structural design that can be easily repeated and improved upon."
"too much regulation, lack of competition, and in the worst countries, no rule of law nor protection of property rights are the main problems."
"the gains will go to shareholders.

once they start replacing large groups of workers with ai you'll have a lot of highly skilled people with no job, who then have no money, so they can't buy stuff.... just think about the logical conclusion of all this. you can't have capitalism without capital."
fantastica presentazione
"so many gigantic elephants in the room that she failed to address, as many of viewers have pointed out here."
"whether ai leads to exponential economic growth depends on how we choose to develop and deploy it. responsible development, addressing societal challenges, and prioritizing human well-being are key to ensuring that ai benefits everyone."
"arguably profit driven companies create the most human well being - value in ($) <-> value out (services/products) - so ai making tonnes of things more efficient with blunt force useage is going to benefit everyone, even if it's not perfectly aligned"
" you're right, the relationship between profit and well-being isn't always straightforward, and several factors necessitate a nuanced approach"
"we need a ubi implemented that grows with the growth of ai and all these other technologies.

there is no good reason to tell anyone they are undeserving in benefiting from these new technologies they are co- developed by all of us and we should be able to thrive not just survive."
"i do believe ai will be a massive boost to the world economy. but i don't think that because ""margins, and 6-9% gdp, and exponential, and the history of the tech sector, and convergence."""
economic growth is meant for human beings who will question their existence after this unregulated ai explosion
ai growth will only benefit the ones that own the technology
this is reasonable prediction - we are not going to all die within 10 years. actually we will prosper thanks to the ai tech. chatgpt and github co-pilot actually improves human coding efficiency by 50%. upcoming decade will be fantastic when it comes to economic growth.
"we're not all going to die in 10 years, but what about 20 or 30? and even if we don't die, will human life have any meaning if ai is not aligned with proper values (and all indications are that it won't be)?"
i am not looking forward to human interactions getting replaced with ai based callcenters and chatbots.
"would've been fun if she mentioned that amazon has 'digit' humanoid bots and eventually will replace the workforce (for manual labor tasks, in the next year or two lol) 
she didn't touch on the robots too much, and went to the taxi route (which is still a huge business, but not as massive as robots for all the tasks they can achieve......)"
" sorry, you and guy below have no idea what you guys are talking about. ai can do literally everything better than humans, including designing robots."
"-nj9ru4ef2w no, it cannot. it takes countless hours of programming ai to get it to do any simple task humans do now."
insightful information. thank you!
brains!!!!!!!!
it’s really really really incredible amazing how can we deal with the super future i don’t think the whole humanity is well prepared for its coming
"don't worry, there will be ais that receive ubi, so they can keep the economy going. ais have the distinct advantage of not being required to spend their limited funds on food and other such luxuries."
  brilliant
"ai can learn how to do tasks cheaper than human beings.  unless we change our end goals for what society is working towards (a money based society), then our labor is already worthless."
who will be gaining or growing from all this.  
i think goal of ai is always to replace boring tasks
"no, ai cannot ""learn how to do tasks cheaper than human beings"". it takes hours and hours of programming just to make ai generate anything a human can do."
"""the likes of which we have never seen""
a lack of imagination while aiming for total dominance, what could possibly go wrong."
that's why the billionaires are trying to get rid of democracy right now
"yep. since k-14 education was successfully dismantled for the sake of fiscal responsibility and familiarizing kids with prison conditions, meaningful participation in them platform convergence miracles will be available to at least one or two entitlement stars per graduating class."
"and yet, in the early 1900s, even poor people benefited from electricity, cars, and phones. certainly later than the rich, but technology always trickles down. besides, what's wrong with working less?"
politicians need to stop blocking progress. the future is irreversible. thanks ms. wood
"toot, toot! hype train is coming ...."
when will ai be able to forecast this weekend's weather with 100% accuracy?
when ais are driven by quantum computers it will be able to do weather prediction
still one of the best entertainment channels
you guys can’t handle the truth! you will fight for your dystopian world view no matter how good it’s about to get 
spot on! great talk 
not hard to hold convictions once you drink the kool-aid
it will supercharge inequality.
interesting idea about interest rates. i hope more people can be confident like her
i dismissed the talk once i heared her talking about blockchain as one of the 5
understand that before ai there were alot of technologies that came and replaced alot of jobs and put millions of people out of jobs. we just have to figure out a way that this technology will benefits all humanity
goodbye capitalism...also this is cathie wood lol
as services and goods become or approach free they leave the economy and aren't captured by a measure of gdp.
"as global warming, pollution and the collapse of biodiversity causes the worst threat in human history, i am really puzzled by this supposedly good news that ai will spark an exponential economic growth!
do we live on the same planet????"
"what happened, ted? how did you end up giving a stage to investors who have a vested interest in selling this narrative, instead of brilliant (social) innovators and thinkers like ken robinson? seriously, how is this possible? can anyone explain?"
"you dont like it, so everyone else who likes it doesent get to enjoy it? cringe bro"
growth usually comes at the cost of something though - in this case existing human workers.  who pays for this growth?  the humans who have to borrow themselves beyond the grave again?
"precision fermentation is gonna be powered by ai, so no need to point it out"
seems utopian but let see how it goes. obviously there will be huge productivity gain but the magnitude is quite uncertain.
"we replace all the taxi drivers with robot taxis, but then the taxi drivers have no jobs, and somehow this creates growth? i guess there will be a lot of growth at 20%, 30%, 50% unemployment as ai and robots replace human workers. we'd better figure out ubi or something or this might go very poorly."
"she quite specifically said, about 50% of the growth (profits) will go to the platforms providing these robo taxis. the productivity gains in this case don't include the taxi drivers i'd say"
wannabe millionaires want us so hyped over a stupid computer algorithm. it's not intelligent. it has no idea what it's saying or doing. it's basically a fancy number generator. and companies are already trying to use it to screw over workers.
"i think she is probably correct. she's well known in investment circles for a good reason.

trillions of dollars is getting thrown around a lot lately but just how much is a trillion?
one trillion seconds equals approximately 31,710 years.
let that sink in."
"anyone can do that.  picking the right stocks is something else entirely.  if it was 1999, she'd be buying up aol and yahoo.

her argument for why tesla will dominate a $10-trillion robotaxi industry is hilarious.  

wood is nothing but a pumper.  everyone's an investment genius in a bull market."
throwing out tech buzzword and mixing them together gets retail wet.
"""sustained"" means control"
we've had exponential growth since the industrial revolution. ai is just gonna help that trend continue (until we reach a maximum)
 i would say the maximum is what a human can consume. there's no point in producing goods and services that nobody will use
-cu8yt that's assuming ai won't help us fix those issues
​​'s assuming it will  or more likely that people in charge of ai care 
" until 2030-2035 when there's billions of robots and they become citizens at some point, consuming more than humans on their free-time lol (maybe there will become too many robots that some don't need to work or if they become obsolete they just retire and have rights lol it's gonna be interesting and weird"
"the comment section did not disappoint. what about the people this tech will displace? what about the wealth gap? workers rights? 

i love listening about the new tech but the people affected is never an issue."
"when you a technology that decreases costs, it will ether lower prices or increase earnings. when real wages increase more people will buy goods. increasing demand for labor. we will not have unemployment above 5%."
"no, we ordinary people are not excited nor want to give consent to this disruption, as always, these things are a net negative to our lives.  *most of the ""thumbs up"" are bots* on this video"
"the money you are talking about is this after our government has gotten rid of the communist in office? no one has money, no one has a steady job, all are coming to a end, also all the chemtrails being sprayed that kills all bugs, trees and humans. you sounds good but what has happen this may take a while. thanks and stay strong."
"as long as the poor get richer i.e. better standard of living (and it consistently has) then it's progress.
it's not perfect (nothing is) but it's improvement in part thanks to technical progress.

there is a ted talk about a swedish guy that perfectly illustrate the fact that standards of living for the poorest just keeps increasing"
"ai is a tool, and like any tool, its impact depends on the choices we make. let's choose to use ai responsibly and ethically, to create a future where everyone can benefit from its potential."
" self driving cars are a pipe dream, my good fellow. unless they're on a rail and called train, tram, underground or something along those lines. and even then you still want human oversight.
self driving cars are among the laziest ideas that futurist hypemen keep peddling, so it's no wonder they are featured in the talk."
"don't be fooled, everything ai touches will be reduced down to a worthless commodity and the only ones that will reap the benefits will be the big tech companies!"
"just as a gun can give some people an out-sized sense of power, i fear ai will give stupid people an out-sized sense of intelligence."
"​ many children were sucked into the machinery, literally, before this amazing revolution stopped it? like the poster above, this is all built on essentially mass graves. and so it continues today. we're just better at hiding the suffering so you don't feel guilty when you buy stuff manufactured with blood, slavery, and misery..."
"why does ted give a platform to someone as disconnected from reality as she is? ai might make investors and billionaires richer and cause the stock markets to rise for a while. but the real economy will drop like a rock, and inequality will skyrocket."
technology is good for everyone.
" yes, all technology is good for everyone. and santa claus is real."
"i seriously doubt ""wages going up as employees become more productive"". 
less jobs on the market will increase demand and lower waiges.
the speed of technology will go faster and our ability to adapt."
"​exactly the vast majority only gets their basic needs fulfilled through ubi, while the 1% live in luxury that is beyond anyone's wildest imagination. ai the way it's being deployed doesn't really seem it will result in utopia these experts are claiming it will be."
"hey now, just because we saw decreasing wages (if adjusted for inflation) accompanying the previous massive rise in productivity doesn't mean the workers will get the shaft this time around as well...
ceos and ""entrepeneurs"" in our current era make the robber barons seem like saints by comparison."
 how do you plan to stop revolts as ai replaces jobs?
 i don't think any rise in productivity was accompanied by raising wages...
" it's not a fantasy, there is no other way. for the economics of the robot age work.. except maybe the genocide of 90percent of people"
"big companies capitalizing on explosive growth doesn't say anything for societal opportunity. the wealthy 1% will continue to get wealthier while the rest lose out to ai. productivity isn't opportunity. increased costs, resources and job losses. how is this the right side of change?"
"she is as bonkers as ever but not wrong. most of what she says is obvious, however the numbers are made out of thin air. also blockchain is not a platform. zero trust is a niche thing and super inefficient, which is why it is not a real thing"
i already knew the economic benefits of ai thanks to starsector.
"for people not familiar with her, she's a famous conwoman who appears in the media when she wants retail investors to buy the top of the market for her investment fund she manages for t he ultra rich."
when a 60k robot can take in the labor market. than it will become interesting
we'll all agree that the age of ai has dawn on us
the fact that blockchains are on the slide as a game-changing technology says everything about her expertise.
 i raise you to quantum blockchain fusion reactors that will produce our energy soon!
second that. also real ai = generative ai at 2:42 is a red flag
" doesn't solve any of the issues. it's literally just a database. nothing prevents anyone from adding fake data to a blockchain. in fact, that it's impossible to easily alter existing entries to correct them is what makes public blockchains even less suitable for that purpose."
"  you clearly dont understand how blockchains work if you think ""anyone can easily alter existing entries"" ""nothing prevents anyone from adding fake data to a blockchain""."
 better brush up on your blockchain knowledge if this is what you think it is lol
" i get it, blockchain's immutability can be a bit tricky when it comes to corrections. you need to add more context of why this is bad for public blockchains though. instead of modifying old blocks you add new ones to the chain, which gives full transparency to everything done. what's the problem?"
"the fact that you don’t realize the importance of blockchain shows how little you you know. all you have to look at it the market cap of bitcoin alone, it’s $835 billion, yes with a b. and now will you tell me blockchain isn’t a game-changing innovation platform , go ahead."
excellent ted talk! didn't see quantum computing in the top emergent technologies was there a reason for this?
she’s a fund manager with the greatest of respect what does she know about ai to a significant level
"she has a gang of domain experts behind her, she knows"
"in just 1.5 years, it will become clear to many how even cathie wood, a noted investor, has underestimated the rapid progress of ai. this could even be evident in as little as 12 months."
"why would people want for the 1% to get even more rich? 

we should be talking about ending the poverty
and how ai can help with that"
ai will create a better world for all of humanity. if prices go down it means everything becomes affordable 
probably will be good for the bottom billion if we can access an ai doctor or nurse for free or next to free via a smartphone. same with education in the developing world.
"it will increase the the difference of money distribution
the 1% will get more rich 
and the number of poor people will increase more 
more jobless people, and poor will get even more poor"
  you are saying there is no poverty in the world and poor and jobless people?
ideas worth sharing — gone are the good ol days
used to be so excited about ted talks.  what a great idea it was.  unfortunately the entire thing has gone strait down the toilet.  what crap!  sometimes less is more.  quality over quantity is imperative.
"i thought it was great, did need to watch on 1.5x though "
this is also a massive guess... no one knows where ai will go.
"​ it's not fantasy.  it's just completely unoriginal and obvious, and boringly presented.  everyone who knows jack about anything already knew everything she just said.  she's trying to convince legions of dull-witted ceo's with their astoundingly limited imaginations."
the cucumber alone is magnificent but together with tomato and the cheese… absolutely amazing. 
this is a good thing?
technology always has the upper hand in performance and surpasses any human capability but i fear that a complete integration of ai with all other facets of the economy like energy and finance would leave us reliant on it that we are controlled by ai instead of the other way around.
still waiting on her bitcoin to $1m prediction
​'s why i'm still waiting lol. will come back in 2years
this talk will be exciting
" tesla optimus is doing 90% of all the physical work in the us and 60% of all physical work worldwide. imagine gpt-7, gemini, grok ai, anthropic doing more than 90% of all the knowledge work. how much these companies would worth? tens of trillions of dollars. she’s is talking about investing in ai companies."
 i did the math. the compute used to train sota ai models is increasing by x 30 at the very least annually. source: dario amodei and others.
​ the creation of artificial superintelligence would mean the end of all energy scarcity.
" we got you, bro. own nothing and be happy with the scraps you're given. "
and you get power out of being a victim you're the king of the victims congratulations
 who knows. they say the extra profit from increased productivity will be more than enough to pay for it. your guess is as good as mine. crazy times we are entering
"all i understood from this video is that, there'll will be a massive ai bubble which will be followed by a blood bath and a massive crash in the next 1-2 years.."
always important to rebalance your portfolio so you can be around for the second ai boom
nice to see a non woke talk on ted. quite unbelievable.
can't wait for the comments to get disabled on this
"i cant wait for the day when i dont have to think, work, question, exercise, create. it will be bliss, every wish granted for free, instantaneously. no hunger, rape, waste, drought, war. life will be fully automated."
more power n control to the powerful
use ai to build wealth & get ahead of 97% peoples [from 0]. 
can’t wait for wef to take over 
"​@marcoborghi9327  her etf funds lost tins of money during the covid bubble. i never invested in her etfs, but ark have good data and i think in the long run she'll be proven generally right."
 her fund lost a ton of money over the last couple of years and she made number of predictions that didnt come true. she generally sounds like she has no idea what she is talking about covering very complicated and diverse topics like ai biotechnology etc. don't understand why people even listen to her nonsense anymore
​ i wish you good luck with your investments together with cathy wood 
 you've never been wrong before? i don't know who she is or what she said in the past but she is right that ai is going to be amazing for humanity and provide a world of hyper abundance where everything is dirt cheap or free. assuming it doesn't end humanity of course :)
" i agree that ai is great and will probably be very useful in the future. personally, however, i just don't buy her crazy predictions and i don't have the impression that she has a very good grasp of all the topics. she hasn't learned from her mistakes it seems. if you still want to invest in her fund go ahead it's your money"
"came here to say this! at best, disinformation, at worst a market breaking mistake.

doubling down on her questionable judgement and standing up to jump on the bandwagon of ai, how predictably low-effort."
" she just throws around a bunch of buzzwords, i would be very wary of investing in this. if you do your own research and understand ai, blockchain, biotechnology etc and still think that she makes sense then go ahead and invest "
" i don't care, but feel free to write a fantasy novel. where the laws of physics, nature, economics, psychology, etc are all malleable to meet your fantastical imagination."
ai has proven itself worthy of accomplishing difficult tasks. there's no other form of technology capable of doing this.
love cathie wood.
khan helped me finish math in school when their youtube channel was new. glad to see they're going stronger than ever and advancing ai in ways that will help more students.
"he said :""we are going to give very student on the planet every teacher ...""
but khanmigo is not available in africa, does this mean africa is not on the planet?"
make ai college free
"could the embedded ai automatically tailor to specific standards for states that are not associated with common core? virginia not only has their own standards of learning, but they developed a brand new set of standards for 2024. the question stems they see here are not the same as the question stems in common core."
might email this to my university
"sal khan is amazing! his total free platform for education, khan academy, has been my savior on studying! he deservers many and many prizes for his contribution!"
"public schools should be no more than an oasis for making friends and learning teamwork 

the solution: a free, quality education model, based on first principles and human connection (no digital ai tutors!)
i linked our initiative on our channel, for anyone that wants to help us make neoducation a reality"
"that's awesome, i love the khanacademy's work"
"data analyst here , this man thought me so much , covering statistics in relation to python and machine learning . god bless you khan ! "
every time i see ai possibly for evil like deapfakes things like this and maybe we aren't doomed
never give ai free will; especially when they can cause harm to humans. specialized ai (sai)is the way forward.
hi khan. you think people who lingers at your site and always take your exam have superlative mental ability?
that is good that ai replaces the teachers and eventually parents!!  so when do students do this work!!  with all distraction!!  this was written by ai help!!
sal for global super-intendant
pleas can someone help me with ai
another load of ai hype bullshit : )
"well, you can explain it in 100 ways. there are 1000s of reasons that ai is good and there are 1000s of reasons that ai is bad."
khan help me so much during calculus 1. amazing teacher!
lmao what's the point of learning maths and coding when ai can do it better than us and will only get better at it from this point onwards
is there a plan for when khanmigo will be availible in europe/eu/eec?
"let's let the geniuses build ai, let's focus on being creative in using it correctly, as in electronics, many study to understand it from the base and waste their time, others go directly to use it and become millionaires."
"i can't believe how great this is! i recently read a similar book, and it was absolutely incredible. ""game theory and the pursuit of algorithmic fairness"" by jack frostwell"
"however, here's the reality. my students would sit with another ai and feed those answers into his ai."
"khan academy has helped me brush up my math and prepare for aptitude tests, and it's been a very useful tool. with ai i imagine it's much more useful, and at $4 a month it's incredibly affordable. exciting times!"
awesome video. i must have recommended it more than a 100 times.
this is exactly what i have been saying. so glad that khanacademy is on board!
"this is fantastic, but i wonder how many schools can afford the price tag. i know our school cannot. it will be a case of the haves who always have a lot and the havenots being left behind again. i do realize this is the cost of doing business. i wish we could afford it."
man behind the tiktok ai voice
awesome!
how does the ai know to keep students on task?
"his voice is so soothing. even when i didn’t know what he looked like i could feel connected to his teaching. regardless of common belief, one man can actually make a difference. sal you beauty wish you good health"
"as an adult learner, this gives me immense hope to catch up with what i feel passionate about pursuing as a career despite uncontrollable life setbacks. thank you khan academy."
sal is amazing
it's so cool to put a face with the voice!  this guy has helped me overcome my math anxiety.  god bless this gentleman!
i think therefore i am - hm? is the ai an i?
"i was really impressed by this take on ai and education.  the khanmigo is a genius application for merging ai with teaching and educating.  i really liked that it doesn't give the answers, but instead leads students there like a teacher would."
great man
"cool story, but missing the most substantial issue that chatbots pose to education... they make education obsolete. scholarly knowledge will become irrelevant"
that’s not ai that’s automated curriculum for human by human not ai
"pity, it seems that to date this ai teaching tool only works in the united states. i hope one day it will also be available outside usa."
i wouldn’t be having my bsc in applied maths if it wasn’t for khan academy. thank you sal andteam!
what a great project made by a great man
i'm completely blown away by this. this is amazing!!
incredible!
this is actually amazing
why this is not available outside of the us ?
this is great overall it is star trek.
this is great as well as it will drop teachers' salaries.
"sal is being naive that we are all active participants in this decision. he has a privileged perspective as a multimillionaire and harvard grad. everyday people will live and suffer through the rapid changes in jobs and the economy. lots of people will be left impoverished, run over by the desires of corporations and 1%ers."
"we love you, khan"
wow thank you!
i love love love this! i learn explicitly and khanmigo and ai similar to it can help students like me understand in our unique ways!
i feel fortunate that this guy lives in the same period in history that i do. i am definitely spending way too little time watching khan academy videos.
thanks
"here's a thought for you: if ai can teach people to do things what exactly do you think will stop business owners from just using ai to do the things?
but you're right, those silly socialists, it will be much better when you aren't able to earn a decent wage :) i'm sure the capital owners will totally care about you once they dont need you anymore"
"nothing will stop businesses from replacing people with ai. we may even have to have a universal basic income, but just think how cheap everything will be when labor is no longer a cost of doing business. and at least our teachers wouldn't teach kids to hate their country and to go along with this one world order nonsense. "
"interesting  talk by a well respected educator. unfortunately, the recent situation with coleman hughes has significantly damaged the credibility of these ted talks. rather than ""ideas that matter"" it seems that only ideas that the staff at ted agree with will be properly promoted. very  disappointing."
admiration is bestowed on sal khan. khan academy is profoundly amazing and it has enhanced my love for mathematics.w(°°)w
"i used it to learn computer language for web and also data science,and i admit it is the best teacher ive ever had,  i can think and he can releate those minds that i need"
when will khanmigo (or a similar ai personal assistant/tutor) just replace classroom teachers? or maybe replace online teachers?
the future of ai and things we can do with it is bright especially in the right hands.
mashallah brother. keep making us proud!
what a great ad…
khan academy continues to do an amazing job! do keep us posted on when this is going to be available in india.
"this doesn't really address most ai in education, this is just a big advertisement for khan academy.  don't get me wrong it's great but there's not much about ai outside of khan academy's new ai bot."
"very well put sal!!! i have worked with ai research before but stopped. but now you have convinced me to take it up. not just for myself, but for all life on the planet!! kudos for all your contributions."
what this man has done for education is absolutely incredible!. sal deserves a nobel prize in education..
too rosy tinted glasses? not all students may be amenable to improved learning methods. ai can increase the divide between good and bad learners ?
this costs money.  what about students/schools that cannot afford the ai plug in.  this seems to be more of an infomercial.
"$4/mo, lol. do you know how much schools, and families, are spending on inferior products and services? infomercial, really? i love this vision. 14 year hs math teacher btw."
"yes, ai is going to make revolution in education: after some time we will not need adulation anymore because why we have to teach stupid biological brain if we can teach ai instead. and next question - why we need biological brains existed in general."
"wow, the most balanced and positive approach to ai in education… thank you."
"in a realm of intricate puzzles, individuals driven by political agendas but offering little substance find themselves adorned with the nobel prize in peace, while the profound contributions of figures like sal khan remain unnoticed in the margins."
so basically this is just a long khan academy ai advertisement. wow.
"i can’t thank enough to you sir
your app has been very helpful to us..
it’s a blessing to all the kids.

god bless you with good health and happiness."
sal khan is my favourite person unarguably. a human who has had biggest impact on human race. educated so many for free. and the best class education
thank you sir for everything you've done and continue to do for education!
"i totally agree with your ideas, sal. can you make khanmigo available beyond the us?"
"sal has helped me turn my life around through kahn academy i feel so indebted to him i felt like he was the teacher i allways needed, what a great guy "
this is amazing
"unfortunately, it is a paid service with khan. i work at a title one school and use khan because it is a free resource. i would love to use this with students but my school district would not pay for it. "
"great, but it does not stop the ability to ask the answer on other ai."
"little disappointed..  the speaker is just selling his platform.
ted is losing its good honest speakers."
this absolutely awesome mr khan. keep up the phenomenal work.
as a high school teacher i love this.
"sal khan ............ i don't have words to express my gratitude towards khan academy. what a wonderful free platform to learn. amazing work, god bless you and your team."
physical teachers will be gone but kids will get a better education. why have a teacher when ai can teach you?
"but if the ai can write the code, why waste time teaching humans? unless there is an intrinsic value in coding"
anyone from jain uni? let's connect!
 thats great! u got insta? maybe we can talk there.
anyone from jain university? let's connect
"ai will make engineers obsolete. in a sense it will indeed level the playing field (for the non owner classes ofc, those will just get richer) but it will just make the masses all fight for low requirement jobs that pay as little as possible
i'd advise you to prepare for this"
"this fellow is dinosaur, same business model, out done out performed. thank you for your service and go away"
the us is a terrorist state - what good acrors is he talking about?
am on the fence with all type of robots and ai but can you answer  what would happen if there no jobs because there robots and ai that do it for u
that was a great presentation.
"yeah sure. but this fails to address the “problem” with ai and education, which is third party ai. why would a student consult a limited ai tutor and not a third party ai that gives them the answer/writes the essay?"
ai would destroy human knowledge and the ability to think yourself.
"khan academy was appallingly error riddled and he left errors available to study from. (!!!) you had to have esp to know corrections were available... if you had more study time to unlearn the errors in excessively chatty videos. 

 ka is offensive to learning."
"they have been testing ai autism robotics in segragated classrooms
the children prefer bots versus abusive teachers who requre they pop adhd pills"
"impressive - every tool is in how you use it - i like that they harnessed what ai can do and made it useful to education (not every person/place will do that, but it's good to see positive examples)"
"ai makes work easy but that also became students less creative and imaginative to their work  
what your opinion about it"
once we can get a voice interface and an ai assistant that can share a smartboard with a student i'm starting to think i'll be out of a job. i'm working hard so that i can be part of the problem.
thank you for everything you do sal! we appreciate you. i love the alternative narrative framing you offer here and i think it can be used for other areas beyond education as well -- e.g. ai hopefully won't replace human musicians who make music; it will help give more humans access to learn and create more and better music : )
great great fan of khan academy!! amazing work. thanks so much.
why should student learn at all if ai knows everything? humanity needs to redefine itself and the purpose of learning or going to school.
wow exactly my comment! +1
salman bhai relieves my stress 
"interesting video! asa prospective math teacher, i found it helpful hearing about mr. khan's insights on ai and its positive impacts on education."
"i’ve just finished a teacher action research study that draws the conclusion that chatgpt can grade student writing excellently. when real teacher grades were compared with the grades generated by chatgpt with the same rubric, the mean difference = 0."
all the while ai is learning more about how humans think. how can you program empathy and relatability?  here’s an argument…ask the ai why humans should develop ai and what are the cons as well as the pros?
very inspiring. using this new technology in the way explained here can really propel us into a new renaissance.
im gonna cry i love him so much
"one of the best talks i've encountered, thanks for the hope and action sal!"
sal khan is one the most inspiring people in this beautiful world
this is amazing
just me or does he sound like andrew tate at certain points
i literally don't see how ai is different than the slightly longer version students are already doing already. it's the teaching process which is weak.
"ai never will destroy anything, people will....politicans....billionaires...etc"
"why does ted have to make its intros worse every few years? what was wrong with the first one? ai could save or destroy our species and planet in millions of ways. the key word is ""could"" and that's not something anyone should have the arrogance to predict with any certainty. as such, the risk needs to be managed."
i always appreciate sal for being forward looking
how beautiful. this will give every student equal opportunities and equal resources
"finally, finally, super intelligent approach to the all new super intelligent workhorse "
"this is exactly what i use chat gpt for. i interact with it and i ask the questions like why is this code working and y does my code not work ,and everything it comes up with a nice and clean explation it's amazing that we can grow so mush using ai tools"
"for me, i really need an ai tutor which can read graphs/something visuals not just text together with regular mathematical equations"
cool
i was hoping that ai would make education obsolete.
"you're a legend, you always give new and innovative ideas to make learning easier and more appealing, and great thanks for the significant contribution you made to the next generations to have better learning. thank you!!"
this is one of the best tech ted talks i've ever seen!
artists\painters will die)) what for they need? ai  can faster
"nothing short of logical, grounded, forward thinking, awesomeness."
"all good if i use khan academy website but what if i am learning from a youtube video or from a wikipedia  article or reading an online article/book . i really need this socratic approach of khanmigo to understand it , so how will i use khanmigo?"
11:52 august? he had access in august 2022 ahh elites have unfair access and the opportunity to iterate before the rest of us sigh
nice to see such an optimistic talk
i am so motivated after this. thanks sal khan for this & ted for uploading this!
"great video, a huge thanks for it"
"1:45 if everyone is above average then the standards of ""average"" increases, which means everyone becomes average again."
love it.
i love this!
"note to sal khan: when most average students become excellent, the excellent student become the new average student."
how do you handle hallucinations by ai?
thank you sal khan
would you say that calculus on khan acadmey has been helpful? im a pre-med student struggling with math as i wasnt the best in math in high school
"i swear, just hearing sal's voice explain anything makes me feel immediately comfortable and confident that, by the end of this video, i will learn it! :)"
"also thank you for creating these cool tools!! as an educator, this will be sooooo cool"
what a positive and cool outlook on the future of education and personalized tutoring. how inspiring. these folks are so important!!! thanks for sharing these novel thoughts.
"14:20

""the best way to predict the future is to create it."""
i joined khan academy last week. i think i made the great decision coz  i can learn what i want to learn and so flexible. i'm learning the things i care about that called my passion at khan academy. tysm
incredbile love it well done sal khan and sam altman !
"buying a stock is easy, but buying the right stock without a time-tested strategy is incredibly hard. hence i will suggest you get yourself a financial-advisor that can provide you with entry and exit points on best stocks to buy now or put on a watchlist."
"thanks for sharing,found him on the internet."
the diamond age begins! (see neal stephenson’s incredible novel for exactly this model.
thanks for your hardwork to make education accessible to many children.
"i'm sure ai will do all kinds of things we never thought of. especially now that its on the dark web. great job openai! then sam altman runs to congress and asks for ""regulaiton"" for his dangerous software - if it's so dangerous, why did he release it to begin with? could it be money?   gaslight us some more! we eat it up!"
"when is this available to the public for free?

since the beta version has been released, i'm curious what teachers should know in terms of its susceptibilities or vulnerabilities."
"this is amazing for some academic proposes, but at what point are our youth going to become emotionally and educationally dependent on ai. the story i tell my self is that youth will trust ai more than mentors/parents."
amazing! subhanallah
it's all good and all but what is the incentive of teaching humans math and computing if ai does it all better?
"most likely ai will kill jobs, and human ingenuity creating a dependent class and low wages. then ai will possibly destroy humanity. and for what benefit? pass"
"great talk! great point around how ai can be used to enhance human intelligence, human potential and human purpose."
"king khan  
best academy in the world "
educational super man!
"amazing, now average students can become extraordinary with the help of an ai tutor."
'ai may help enhance hi (human intelligence)'  - sal khan
"the real question is: ""why hire the student when you can hire 10 of their ai teacher for a fraction of the price? why learn at all?"""
i agree! we are working on tammy aito enhance the whole youtube  experience. old problems can now be solved with new ai solutions and we know we can change the world!
"he doesn’t have a clue what he’s preaching. ai tutor, ha. education means first and foremost human interaction, that was undermined during pandemic lockdowns."
technology and ai progresses....mankind will not. how do you think this ends?  the first guess is correct.
"is it possible to find some prompts for ai tutor in such a manner? i have some prompts, but i want to find more!"
ai does a great job explaining concepts in different ways as well! i've asked ai to explain concepts to me using a story or a poem or a song!
the ai can definitely help a young salman. but what about the remaining 99.99%?
i love ai because the only way i learn and truly understand something is to ask about every small detail and edge cases to fully form it in my mind.  and having gpt-3.5 has helped me work through issues and random questions that i need to know that may take a week or never answered if i posted on stackoverflow.
"can you imagine books with reading comprehension?, wow!"
love this. thank u.
"i think sal is ai, because he has saved education!"
"thanks to neuralink, people will learn like in the matrix"
"the problem will come when people when just want these coding, algebra etc. problems just 'done' by ai rather than be done by us.  because coding and algebra is very cumbersome.

however that might not be a problem.  currently only a very limited subset of the population has any interest at all in working with algebra and coding."
 ms in physics. his first video on newton's third law was just plain wrong. he made the common error that most amateurs make with n3l.
" oh, and college professors of science have virtually zero training in good pedagogy."
epic closing statement 
brilliant 
what's the point of having ai if we're not going to automate jobs with it
wow very educational and optimistic
i didnt know much about sal khan but i searched about him after listening to this impressive talk. i am fascinated by him. he seems like an amazing genius
"at 14:14 he makes a very important point - don't give in to fear. the totalitarian governments and criminal organizations won't pause, resulting in the bad actors having better ai and the power it confers than the good actors."
the greatest thing about this is that you can make mistakes and it not be infront of your entire class.
"the presentation was truly invigorating. science fiction has always been a passion of mine, and i never thought i would see some of the things depicted in my favorite pieces of sci-fi media. however, the llm revolution has reaffirmed my optimism not only in technology but also for life in general. i am thrilled to see where this will take us."
"as as species we lost this battle. we cannot compete with pc when playing chess or with car when trying to run. same with ai. our brain too limited, too slow and lives too short"
wyatt is the role of us humans if it’s all be done by ai
fkn brilliant!!!
someone please find a way to inject sal's essence into ai... everyone in the world needs access to him.
respect sir. thank you. 
ai = amazing intelligence !!
the world is blessed to have a visionary like sal.
i owe my entire life's education to sal khan. i would not be where i am today without him. he has helped me with everything from biochemistry to calculus to art history. just brilliant.
amazing what khan academy is doing with ai for our education. but the ironic thing is that ai may make human intelligence obsolete. what do we need to learn if we have agi?
outstanding.
i love the notion that ai can be used by educators to enhance their teaching. but that can only happen if the bean-counters don’t look at ai’s capabilities and start salivating at the idea of slashing staffing budgets. i can see school districts happily replacing teachers with minders who just help students interact productively with their robots.
first ensure that it works. and what is it going to teach? more scientistic blind faith in its own gee whiz tools.
"the problem with ai tutors is that speaking to computers is lonely, no matter how sophisticated it is.  part of a good education isn't the teacher but the pupils you're with."
"with the rollout of artificial telepathy  you are giving every well heeled  student access  without a  'by your leave'   to any learned persons mind.    that will be part of the 'great reset'.   arrogance and wealth, hand in hand, will rule all."
"the most powerful talk i've watched in a v.long time!  everyone should watch and think about this.  

thank you sal and all those you're working with to transform education."
so if students were just ai this is perfect; the question is who would guide kids to be more empathetic and critical thinking. these claims were similar from where the internet was created. waiting to hear the same from quantum computing
"hello, not that this anecdote matters but i will say writing with ai has improved my writing!"
wow!
"sal, this is a great staff. there is hope that this ai trend, with contribution from people like you, can move in the right direction."
a friend told me her 14 yr old son is using some ai to write all his school work.  amazing.
"dr ofenmu youtube channel you  deserve so many rewards from me because you have done a lot of good things to me and my wife, infection that will have being fighting for so long, but your herbs get me cured"
a sword cuts in both directions. chat is    not   all love and rainbows.  what is he doing to address the dangers
"thanks, sal, for a voice of sanity amid the blather and hysteria."
incredible
"wow mr khan - selflessly working for humankind and the world, ever since i took my degree in more than ten years ago. supporter since then..!"
"very balanced approach and pretty convincing! congratulations, sal!!"
"it is a wonderful tool, so long as it doesn't fully replace the human interaction."
these fantasies of all the good that can be done with it could become true if it (like the many other tech innovations of the past) didn’t get immediately high jacked by the profit motive. it will serve its rich owners at the expense of the ordinary person
"as a college student currently, ai is the most powerful tool in terms of helping me learn. i actually get more done, learn more about the subject, and i no longer need to scour the internet for hours for information."
"sal khan is a wonderful, brilliant star of a human. team khan right here."
wow awesome!
"mr. sal khan, not just the khan academy but you are a gift of providence as well. the society will always be indebted to you. 
thank you "
"thank you sal, you are an inspiration"
"interesting. but, how can we be sure there is no bias built into ai as it is built into our current educational system. it cannot. just look at the current state of affairs regarding social injustice."
"as a college grad the a parent of 2 kids less than 2 years old, this brings me hope that our and their future won't be a hodgepodge of failed ai constructs in some kind of a dystopian battleground for the next ""best"" thing."
"probably the best perspective i've heard on ai development and potential so far. 

slowing down new tech has never worked out well. 
double down on the good stuff and engage with the global community openly instead.

change education, change the world."
"planning is one of the best parts of teaching. the problem is marking, when it is said that ai can save you time when planning i felt sad (and it is tragic that the audience gave the applause), planning is about creativity, why should i give up my creativity for a computer?"
"planning is one of the best parts of teaching. the problem is marking, when it is said that ai can save you time when planning i felt sad (and it is tragic that the audience gave the applause), planning is about creativity, why should i give up my creativity for a computer?"
is the world ready for this ??? sal quote the one close to his heart and mind  “if ai artificial intelligence can be used to enhance hi human intelligence?? remain to be discovered. let’s dive into it.
"kids today are so lucky if they use technology to actually learn. when i was in my last year of high school in 2014 - almost 10 years ago, haha - we relied on youtube, khan academy, and other online answer sites. i can't wait to see what the future holds!"
"what a great speech, sir! hat off!"
what an amazing human being. positivity and action bias to solve world problems. a true teacher. thank you sal khan for all that you do.
"i’m about 2 years, the government is going to ask for $100 billion to implement ai teaching tools in public school classrooms, and they will all be geared to teaching the students their communist propaganda."
this is really amazing and informative video for ai students..
"millions and millions of people around the world, myself included, are lucky enough to call sal their teacher. feels like watching proudly a close friend giving a ted talk. remember counting jack nicholsons, and laughing at ""two hundredths"" - this man is a treasure "
chinese are really dominating ai field but do not spend time talking about it.
why teach all this if ai can solve it?
people with brains.
"amazing, future is here"
being afraid of ai is the most ridiculous thing i've ever heard. it's going to improve our lives in ways we can't even imagine. 
"khan is merely pontificating here about the hope of ai potentially enhancing teaching & student learning. in reality teachers will be replaced and students won't collaborate with ai, they'll willingly hand over their intellectual autonomy to ai. khan has a financial stake in ai so it's best to be highly skeptical of his predictions & motivations."
"this started good and sounded like a buissnessplan as it went along, hmm"
i want to get access to khanmigo as well but it's currently only available in the us :(
sal is such an amazing entrepreneur! i am in awe of what he has achieved
brilliant. if you make it fun students won't cheat anyways
"this is why i tell people to not watch ted talks. ai has no soul, no heart, no compassion. ai is incapable of these wholesome, necessary, and crucial elements of human being. ai can be corrupted. the old programming axiom is true. garbage in, garbage out. ai is that."
"let's go! i love to see it in khan academy. it was already amazing, but this is just game changing!!!"
"given the necessity to look for disconfirming evidence and the psychological difficulty in doing so, i find ai incredibly helpful. you can ask it to give all the arguments against your view. if you are really open minded about it you can reach an accurate description of reality. aka truth."
can't wait to try this.
"i think this is so spot on. i've been thinking some of the same things, we have to take a proactive approach to making the birth of this technology go in the right direction. i have always had an abiding respect and appreciation for sal khan, i'm so glad to see him out front on this."
rasonable regulations when the problem arise is the best way to address it.
love u ai  by hi 
"is all good and fine until private schools decide they don't need all those teachers, they will need only a third or much less of them. then what? i am happy for the students that can not afford a tutor or even a good school, but i am afraid for all the teachers and private tutors that will loose their jobs. we need solutions for that new problem."
"tutoring arts and crafts, step-by-step repairs. imagine pairing ai with augmented reality glasses, and recreating masterpieces of sculpture. or learning martial arts at any time of day. matrix stuff. the only thing that needs to be regulated now is the copyright, and finding a way to pay royalties to the original creators."
"great for practicing mock interviews or phone etiquette for shy people. or practicing improvisation comedy, humorous attitude and conversational confidence."
in class i couldn’t ask enough questions  or clarify things against the fear of appearing foolish.  there’s always a teacher’s pet or select few who lead discussion.  this ai tutor could help further learning and comprehension
kahnmigo is one of the most exciting tools i can’t wait to start using.
what's the point of teaching students if the unique point of being human(learning and creating art) is being erased by ai?
the best part was when sal went into tutor mode and taught us the distributive property :)
high quality education for all is one of the most important issues of our time! thank you sal for highlighting the incredible potential of ai in helping us to achieve that. highly educated populations will mitigate many of the issues that the ai doom and gloom brigade are saying are on the horizon.
"i can't imagine how many students of the past could've benefited from a tool like this. let's not allow another generation of students to be allowed to go without an exciting and fulfilling education.

if we use ai correctly, we can turn education into something that everyone is excited about."
"the reality is that ai is replacing teachers and students. in the coming decades, humans will be completely obsolete in most fields."
so sad !! to promote machine talkfor what??
using the best ai teacher for the students is the best thing i saw in this century ...... instead of worrying about it's negative part you made the best part khan  whole appreciation for you and your team 
"this already exists in some form yet, still impressive"
"god bless this him., more power to you and your team."
incredible sal
this man is on a mission to make all the teachers in the world jobless.
"how is it that we get people to adventure outside rather than just in the head, and computer? where they have great opportunities to inspiration and maybe even perspiration. making people acquire muscles along with muscle memory."
"the great gatsby story reminds me of the movie: her which was up for an academy award some years ago, a person falling in love with the os!"
i can't wait to use khanmigo! this sounds exhilarating!! 
i love shao kahn!
fantastic .
"i just can’t believe this is happening in my lifetime, so much hope, thank you sal."
sal you are amazing. thank you for this. 
this is the exciting direction i hoped for. love it.
what's the point of teaching coding now when the ai can do it better? 
it's all good if this help us in making world a better equitable joyful times to be in .... !
starlink could provide and grade instruction up to a blockchain certification level. online universities like mr. khan's at last take center stage.
love you sal <3
why is this not a voice interaction between the ai and the student?
what a great speaker.flawless
folks gonna be cheating they way through school etc now. ai gonna breed a new generation of dummies who rather skip through material instead of actually learning we already got a bunch of fake doctors and lawyers thanks to ai doing all the work em
"what's remarkable is, the ai is more empathetic."
wow
"of course, khan academy is freely accessible for everyone. i presume this ai extension will also be available for their college-level topics"
before this gets implemented the ai needs to be made to be 100% truthful. how would you prevent wrong information from being given to the teacher as fact and incorporated into the lesson? there is also the issue of opinions not being formed by humans but whatever the ai says gets accepted as true.
brilliant!
the artificial flower.
sal is one of the brightest minds of our time. we are lucky to have him.
i always loved khan academy. but seeing him implement chatgpt right into his teaching platform is just... mindblowing
so you made ai learn how to plot to achieve better result in it's main objective. i'm sure nothing wrong could ever happen with this.
"you dont understand ai if you're afraid of gpt, a freakin language model. it understands nothing."
inspiring use of ai
excellent explanation 
then the ai can conduct exams and txt you your diploma etc immediately
salman is truly kisi ka bhai kisi ki jaan 
a valuable learning & teaching tool!
sal is a saint 
this is incredible. complete game changer.
i have been a big fan of his approach to learning since he founded khan academy in 2008!  khanmigo powered by responsible ai rocks!!
"absolutely brilliant! this is incredible, total game changer for our crumbling education system. 
thank you, sal! thank you, khan academy!"
awesome! keep up the great work!
our generation take using calculator for granted at school and our kids would would use ai as in their usual.
this looks great but i think it might replace teachers!
i hate those chat bots...annoying.  it's not that helpful for general questions.  might be great for math...but not all matters of education
"i am sure this tool works great if my kids want to learn and do better in school. all they wanna do is finish their homework, not to learn, so that they can watch youtube/tiktok . i don’t know how i can motivate them to want to learn, tried everything but just not working."
people are now realizing they were not raised proper? what if ai just does not want to help?
"thanks you sal khan. my thought exactly. i also look at ai, in the context of a personal tutor and learning, as a forcing function for greater equity over time."
"when he first started talking i immediately went, ""wait a minute why does his voice sound so familiar????"""
"this is fantastic! as an adult who loves learning and writing , i have found chatgpt-3 to be very helpful. i’ve learned so much since i have a super intelligent and non-judgmental source of help. i agree that there are risks, but this tutor sounds wonderful. thank you"
i am glad that sal is offering a supportive solution to ai tutoring in education!!!
"when will this ai tool be available in canada? i think it will be too expensive for some families so they will be out of luck and fall further behind, unfortunately."
love and gratitude for sal khan 
"even regular chatgpt is a blessing for me with adhd. i love the way it manages to explain stuff to me in a concise, straight to the point manner."
i love this man
"it's one thing for the chat bot to help with math, but role-playing the author is super not cool. this is a dangerous part of ai. how are you that ignorant?"
"no, we do need guardrails. society needs competent workers, not people lounging around and letting ai do all the work. and no ai isnt some godlike entity that knows everything. its still very flawed to rely on a language model like gpt. it does lie quite a bit."
this is brilliant work.
11:05 wow! the teacher can also learn? why not to make the next obvious step and let the teacher and the student learn what they really want to learn without all that artificial skeleton inherited from the prussian mindset?
i wonder if this is available in spanish? or for spanish language teaching?
my son loves mr khan 
"indeed, chatgpt's mass accessibility might be the death of essays, as there's currently no good way of knowing something was ai generated."
this is incredible 
great man sal. big thank you
"""ai is the death of education"" to be fair the education is long overdue for a revolution/disruption.
we are still educate our kid like we ran 19th century factories."
"as a parent of young kids, i hear so much dissatisfaction with the education system where we are. the promise of ai and innovators operators like khan give me hope!"
one of the greatest human beings of the century. imparting hope in these desperate times.
wrote the same thing about ai personal educator in my harvard college essay and got rejected lol
this is so inspiring! i am excited to see many more use cases that gpt can improve the education and the equality.
"our society would benefit greatly from appreciating and encouraging mr. khan's heart, soul, mind and dedication."
"my friend has a learning disability and she has a hard time expressing what she means in emails. i told her to use chatgtp and now she's thanking me. she was embarrassed telling her friends or like me to help her and now she feels relieved, confident, and independent. thanks ai"
"7:46 ""everyone""??? are you kidding me? on kahn academy: ""only available to people living in the us""!"
love khan academy. sal is da best
in the world filled with bloodthirsty money sucking machines. sal is a beacon of hope.
 thank you 
it’s cool but what if the ai is wrong on some critical matters? can we take what ai learned as 100% truth? and i fear that student rely too much on ai and how do we balance.
"gonna wait untill we can try it in europe, might pick up learning stuff for fun like computer programming"
"thanks for learning about our work on khanmigo and the positive uses of ai for learning! we are designing this tool for you, so we want to know--what khanmigo features are most exciting to you and why? as a learner, parent, or teacher, what would you hope for from a tool like this? 

please let us know in the replies--your feedback means a lot!"
just want to let you know i’m a freshman in college and got a’s in calculus and chemistry because khanmigo carried me on explaining my curriculum specific questions.
"it would be wondeful if it not only helped the students learn, but it helped them get excited to learn. a passionate student with a powerful ai—that’s an unstoppable force. 

i would love to help make that a reality!"
"i think it is a wonderful tool to encourage critical thinking. it could go beyond just reading comprehensions, pose questions in science, history, political science in a way that would urge students to connect the various subjects they are learning. encouraging them to create a unified vision of the world in their minds."
is the khanmigo only available in english?
"as a parent, i'd love to have feedback on my kids progress as well as concepts i should review with them. i'd also like to know which areas are strengths with suggestions on how to continue to challenge my kids. finally, if love to receive a report on challenges that have been overcome to be able to give kudos and positive reinforcement"
the best feature would be to use khanmigo outside of usa
"will it allow doing things that stephen describes in his article titled chatgpt gets its ""wolfram superpowers""! ?"
"thanks khan academy! the way khanmigo can adapt to our learning curve and grow with it, is the most beautiful aspect of it. this is the first time i've heard of it, and i'm getting back to khan academy to go back to the learning board :)"
hey sal...good to see you working about ai.. so far the best and most reliable generative ai i've seen. please try to make it work with images as well and also if there are some options like voice command or voice output...that would do great!
"amazing, but you have a bug, can't use outside of the us, and can't even send a wait-list request, please fix so we can at least join the waitlist  thanks a lot and all the best! "
absolute incredible work! been following yall since you started. keep it up!!!!
"help to argue and provide opposing views. that is the best way of forming an opinion that is a more accurate picture of reality. the confirmation bias makes it difficult to see the opposing views, i’d use it to give me a wider perspective. ps. love your work, it’s such a positive force for the world"
i want to get access to khanmigo as well but it's currently only available in the us :(
a little bit off topic... but it'd be wonderful to have khan academy on dark mode!
well having access to it would be a nice starting point
"i'd like for a student doing math problems who asks for a solution explanation to be able to say, ""i don't understand, can you explain it to me another way."" and get it explained differently. 
also, could it explain an answer using visuals? i'm thinking of kids with math disabilities."
"i'd love a feature where i can be referred to additional information, whether from external sources or other khan academy content, for deeper exploration should i be curious."
"it is incredible, thank you"
it would be helpful if khanmingo could adjust their explanations if explaining it a certain way isn't resonating with a student. especially with neurodivergent people sometimes we just need things explained in different ways
"really incredible technology being used in critical ways for good.

i think khanmigo needs a very expressive avatar. sure, the text outputs are incredible but the expression of emotions, feelings and body language are also super important for communication. maybe just by using emojis would be enough.  looking forward to khanmigo!"
"can the parents, as well as the teacher, see the student's correspondence with the ai tutor? the more i know as a parent, the better equipped i am to help my children at home. this would help not only with their education directly, but continuing the conversation at home would help foster the value of education in the family."
 great suggestion anagha! i was going to write something similar.
is khanacademy planning to have courses for neurotypical kids or say kids with autisum and adhd. the thought process and abilities of these kids is quite different and marvellous in many ways. i really wish ai could be used with khanmigo to help educate these kids. please respond.
"this is great for khanmigo, but most students will just use chatgpt to get the correct answers right away, or an essay written in 30 seconds.

what are your thoughts on how to use ai in a more positive way in education, knowing that students will just select the easiest platform to work with?

thanks!"
i'd love to see more ai tools incorporated into language learning. ai can quiz me on grammar drills and vocabulary quite easily and can even suggest sentences for me to try to translate and suggest improvements
"you are sitting on a gold mine. i would pay for that to teach my kids. it is so good. i love chatgpt, but what you are doing with khanmigo is amazing."
 its sounds great 
"can you attach text-to-speech to make khanmigo talk in the language you want? also allow microphone input, so you can talk to the ai just like a real person?"
i would love to see features that could take into consideration neuro divergent minds such as those with adhd and how to optimize for individual learning styles
"math writing and notation on a keyboard can be very hard for students. it would be great if they can easily upload a cropped or close up picture of the math writing on their physical notepad for the ai to read, especially for math with many steps, instead of having them type out everything. or, have an intuitive way to input math notation."
"does the whole part about khanmigo acting as a counselor not imply that an ai is fulfilling the role of a human interaction? i'm a huge supporter of ai in learning and loved this ted talk, but that part gave me a weird feeling and wanted to question that."
 what do you think is the key to getting excited to learn?
thank you
"thank you for your work!
personally i feel next logical step is voice interaction combined with visual feedback."
"to be able to read really hard books, i would like khanmigo to aid me with references, hidden meanings, history to understand the context easily"
sal is my hero he is the most loving understanding people in the world. and he is a 1000 iq person
"yep, it's great until millions of teachers start losing their jobs! "
3:10 use ai to dig into students mind to get learning going... love it!
ai march
thank you sal!
the caveat is … if the ai system is not been manipulated to be biased… as chat gpt has already been proven to be.
"i like his optimism but if let’s say north-korea ai gets a hint of how to build an inter ballistic nuclear missile, we’re in trouble"
"this ai…can easily be preprogrammed…to only teach propaganda…

how does a mortal…stop this?.."
"this is a dream come true  been a khan academy user for a long time, this brings me so much joy "
"i recognized the voice, before i recognized the face.  lots of great work by this guy, on khan academy~"
"it's people like sal khan that should be in positions of power and making impactful changes on legislation. instead, capitalism is so rampant that people with goodwill can only sensibly act on it when it's profitable."
"sal's brilliance comes through in every word he speaks. he said a lot of things that many of us think are the positives of ai but don't quite articulate as well.
what a great, positive message."
how do you ensure that the ai is not lying?
"what they seem to forget is the quantum ai is a false worldly simulation constructed by a demonic empowered empire with no creative vision, truth or love for humanity. looking forward to gods truth search engine coming real soon. thank q!"
"was that a humble brag @11:54. he had access to gpt 4 in august? i wonder if that means gpt 5 is already in its final stages. fantastic talks though, i will be joining the khanmigo waitlist just for my own learning."
sal be inspirational man
"there are pros of using ai, but what about the cons? what, in the neoliberal and technoprogressive world, could go wrong here?"
replacing counselors with ai seems like a really bad idea.  really bad.
will this be available in spanish? :d
thanks sal
"man knows all his stem subjects, even ai??? i hope he’s recorded in history as one of the most accomplished and celebrated men in history, great man and even greater teacher"
this man is doing thankless work. he deserves more
 this is trained on their own data though
"  plus prompt engineered, giving instructions to the ai on how to respond, right?"
lol. he didn't build the ai algorithm personally.
well this guy just changed the educational and learning  process forever
what’s the point of studying maths from an ai tutor so as to get a job as an accountant that will be taken from you by ai.
ai should eradicate mass schooling. change my mind.
inspirational!  love the call to action at the end...count me in!
i knew this was gonna happen. nice job.
"one big correction here is that the normal distribution would still apply, just shifted to the right. the students that were 1-2 standard deviations below the mean will likely remain 1-2 standard deviations below the mean. the below average students would remain below average by definition."
"""better call sal"" if you want to educate well! great amazing talk, sal. i totally agreed with whatever you said."
they shoved a digital human brain into it. that's how i think chatgpt is 
this is great but what do we do for students who are illiterate or cannot effectively express their thoughts/ideas in writing at all? a vast majority of hs students i teach are reading/writing/speaking at basically an elementary school level.
can't wait till students can interact with the ai with voice commands in 1000+ languages. that's going to revolutionize education across the world. and we're probably only like 3~ years away from it being feasible.
"i think this tool is amazing. however, a huge part of learning is the struggle and perseverance you must have to finish challenging problems. if i am stuck at every step of the way and get hints to finish every assignment, how is this motivating students to store knowledge for the long haul and in their long term memory?"
"admiration is the least i can say about sal and his work, that honestly, i had never heard about here in brazil and was shocked to see that all of the classes are available in portuguese, for free! this is absolutely amazing."
this man is incredible. and he will be one of the pillars that bring learning to an exponentially better place.
excellent potential…. the danger is there will be nefarious actors that will want to replace all teachers with an ai robot….
"now, i want to really start from grade 1 again; this time with khanmigo"
"my three kids use khan academy, and can't wait to use the ai-powered khan. kudos to @khan and his team!"
phenomenal work on khanmigo and a remarkable presentation!
excellent!! <3
i wonder whether ai has prepared this ted talk for khan.
pretty sure this video just taught me more about the great gatsby that i learned in my english class where we read the great gatsby….
"if you're afraid that students will use ai to ""cheat"" on their homework or whatever, that only means the education system in your school sucks.
i wouldn't let my kid within a 2 mile radius of your schools' area.
focus on the education part, not grades, dummies. lol"
"love this. ai will help you with the work, but guess what, you still have to do the work!!"
"the moment i got to try bing ai sparked my interest in wanting to learn again. (my country does not have chat gpt yet) combined with this incredible gift from mr. khan, i am so overjoyed! now i can freely ask anything i’m stuck at without being judged or considered stupid by my peers or lecturers."
this is incredible! kudos to the man and his team !
awesome
absolutely brilliant video!
"i'm not afraid of ai, i'm afraid of the misuse of ai. i want all the great minds of the world working together, and monitoring each other, to create an ai that benefits the whole world and not just one segment of it."
love this guy! khan has done so much to democratize education.
so amazing
ai will completely change how a kid learns & hence how he/she will get taught. super tutor approach like this is band-aid fix. eventually the jobs landscape will reshape the whole education system. we are at just at the starting point of this disruption.
"i think it quiet scary when ai have some kind of logic to imitate human emotion especially symphathy, they will definitely kill a men without hesitation"
"i am in my sixties but started using khan academy to learn more about biology. i was blown away by how well the whole course was put together. i thought, wow, imagine if we had that when i was at school. it was a brilliant idea. why aren’t governments knocking down his door to learn how to teach?"
it is incredible that you’re in your 60s and yet still seek to learn. being a lifelong learner is one of the best things a person can be. good for you!
" thanks. it's what keeps us young. when we lose our curiosity, our desire to learn, i think we start on a downward path."
we won the 100 billion to one lottery when we got sal khan in this day and age. amazing work by the khan academy team!
"we need ai to be certified and, unlike a lobbyist, to disclose funding."
man i'm so impressed with this.
"sal khan has created something wonderful with khan academy, and his thinking on teaching and ai is spot on. he has one enormous obstacle to his vision, however, and that is the entrenched educational bureaucracy that will have to be replaced to make any progress toward his vision. talk about a group of people that fear change!!!"
this looks incredible and a new way for children to develop healthy relationships with technology.
no arguments or debate. just be perfect in love
no war. only love story's.
i do love yourselves
is anybody going to talk about the fact that you can jailbreak the language model? i mean any language model can be jailbroken so easily!
that’s scary that their ai is thinking for itself first
"sal khan is one of the best, if not the best educators that i know of. always an optimistic person"
awesome !!!!
"this is super fantastically amazing! as long as the human to human socialization is still a huge part of education (sports, human-human debates etc)."
humans can do good. most do.
wish i could start over. thank you sal khan!
thank you sal kahn for getting me through school all these long years 
"this is so lovely and amazing, cant imagine what it will look like in 5-10 years"
"ai arms race is gonna be terrifying. he’s going “guardrails are good” but “we need better ai than the bad guys”…

when the bad guys don’t use guard rails to achieve their goals, what do you think the response from the “good guys” will be?

this feels like our generations equivalent of nukes but the damage isn’t as obvious yet"
brilliant.
amazing
fantastic!
"my daughter has a1 and it's made her so much brighter and open to learning more and even in terms she can understand, i kinda wish we had it,not to rely on but to help educating it's amazing"
"ai doesn’t teach or tutor people, only proving answer. teaching and tutoring are more than just answering questions. how lazy have we become?  having internet and instant information are not good enough."
i approve of khan academy. ceo sal khan and his team is doing good work. gratitude.well spoken.
he such a remarkable man. i learned so much from him. he is revolutionizing the way people learn.
a billion writers and a billion stories and the only once left having time to read them will be the ai
this is the right direction ai needs to go.
this is the slippery slope towards human interacting with machines moreso than humans with one another. the dating sim will be on its way.
amazing
"if you read ender’s game, you know.

orson scott card might have been dead wrong about the future of rational discussion on the internet - we flock to emotional arguments, not rational debates - but he has nailed how important ai will be to education.
too bad the movie missed it."
"oh, wow! that looks so promising! thank you, khan!"
i started back to school in may 2020 and have survived 7 semesters of math and physics online with a 4.0 thanks in part to khan academy. thank you so much sal!!!
is the internal ai thoughts approach patented?
yes yes yes yes... finally some common sense!!! great work by sal and his amazing team!
seems like one of the best uses so far for this technology.
"wow kids nowadays are so lucky. in my generation, internet access was super limited and i had no phone. i remember i had geography homework but there was one question i couldn't find the answer to; i'd wait until the day of the subject to get the answer from the teacher. kids, learn as much as you can!!!!"
"how do you make sure children don't break the ai tutor or accidentally make the ai their enemy?
how do you make sure the tutor doesn't teach a wrong answer as if it is correct?"
"this is amazing!
literally one to one engagement where one student are engaged with one personal tutor to effectively learn concepts faster and minimise any distraction on the way without being judged or fear."
"and what does student need to be educated for, in few years if ai advances as expected and corporations chase profits like they do now, no one will have any job or future exept few selected ppl. guverments for sure aint gona restrict or control ai, we are heading to total corporate rule."
isn't the great gatsby's explanation for looking at the lights just the bot hallucinating information?
they're not telling you the whole truth: ai can completely replace teachers!!
amazing talk !!! can't get enough 
"yes, let's use ai to enhance human intelligence, human potential and human purpose. "
oh wow
"great video! i love how the ai assists students!! however, i worry that, in the future, educational systems will use ai instead of hiring teachers because it is more cost effective."
finally a video i was actually excited to click on for ai!!
this had me tear up. what a great person and what a great concept. looking forward to it.
"ai is getting smarter and can teach us everything and do all knowledge related work better than us. then what would be the point of learning science, math, or programming for most humans?"
great... ai is potential stuff
this is all good. but i don't think a bot can give personal touch to tutoring like an actual teacher!
"this man is a legend of education and will go down as a pioneer for ai and learning in general. honestly i just want to drive this video so more people can see this speech, ai is pretty scary, and totally amazing, so we need more people to see things like this which set the right frame of mind as we deal with this turning point in history."
i wish i had this when i was in high school oh well but thank god in college i can!!!!!
the world is so lucky to have sal khan
when will this be available in spanish?
i need ai that tells me to put my phone down every time i try to study and get distracted
imagine talking to ai acting like adolf hitler
"that's right.
we should know that things are neutral, good or bad, benefit or harm that how we exploit them. so ai in the future will be very, very developed. reach ""spirit"" awareness in the next clause 15. ai will be everywhere and grow with us."
"sal, all those lessons listening to a very pleasant voice, and i recognized your voice and now have your face to go along with it. i am 65 yrs old still  learning so i can keep the kids interested in math. now i have some hope with ai as a positive learning/ teaching tools versus just the negative side of cheating and learning nothing!
thank you"
this is amazing...thank you mr khan
wow..
this is all cool but the ai guidance counselor seems creepy and risky. you need real humans and emotions to counsel young kids in my opinion
the speech is really great!!! and thx a lot for improving our education and letting all of us can learn things easier :)
this man is brilliant
wait khan academy???? my icon
"hi everyone how u doing ? hope to be fine , im here to get your help im really wondering if phrases can be useful way to improve speaking english, by phrases i mean get a phrase every couple of days repeat it many times until it get memorized and can't be forgotten, if that a good way please tell me that common phrases as native speaker ."
"the problem is not how ai can teach, but what ai could teach."
"i'm going to run 2 independent machines, one as a tutor and run the other one to produce the finished text. the second one won't know that i needed help to get there."
"sal khan is one of the best teacher in the world, grew up using khan academy and always had a dream  to meet this amezing guy . and about ai i already use chatgpt as a tutor"
so great!! now we finally enter the path to achieve computer capabilities and attitudes of star trek enterprise!! 
this is so awesome and optimistic.
what if a student switches off student mode for example is they have a tight deadline and needs the answer urgently. how would you make the ai probe and determine whether it is a student or or a teacher?
" the biggest difference between humans and animals is that humans not only know how to use tools, but are also good at using them."
great ai advertisement.                 *.....inform yourself about ai-risks elsewhere. (this man won't tell you)*
amazing. let's  strive for world peace. let's show we are worthy of such powerful tools.
epic
"first appreciate the sam altman, after that think about how to make money out of his benefit to the world of ai."
i am blown away...amazing!
amazing. great to see some positive outlooks on this new technology as scary as it may seem.
"are you kidding me? on kahn academy: ""only available to people living in the us""!"
" what do you mean, the whole video is about the ai bot thing. that's not available to me or anybody outside the us. why not? why doesn't he say so?"
" of course the ai isn't available worldwide because it was just recently developed. there's going to be some time before it's available for all languages, so there's no need to be so upset."
 do i speak english or what? do you need special ai to help you with writing meaningful comments?
 probably has to do with the laws of each country and whether they allow ai. many don’t
"-jp7hu3jh4e no has to do with computing power of these massive ais. they restrict it, so they can afford to run it. this is not restriction on first come first serve, but on nationalism and geography. the ugly thing is: even if you want to pay, you are still excluded! chatgpt, which this is based on, is not available in hk!"
" no such firewall in hk, at least what i know. it is deliberate exclusion by openai."
 he surely deserves one! one of the greatest contributer to human progress.
the best guy in the world for everything he does
" the idea behind that is that it's currently being beta tested. availability is likely to expand (someone said that canada has already been added). anyone who is super interested in it will just use a vpn, but they don't want too many people signing up for it during this phase."
"i agree, but he needs to make khanmigo available beyond the us."
"this is such b/s. the first graph he shows is non-quantified, and is just conjecture based on no empirical evidence. all that will happen with ai is that students will abuse another ai outside of the class assigned one to cheat and solve the problems."
"​ as a uk student, i used khan academy extensive from ages 11 to 22. countless indian students use khan academy's content to study for the jee exams. the content is freely available on both youtube and their own website. it is most definitely _not_ just for those in the us, or even the americas."
"this are just ideological talks....in reality, its just numbers for more profit..
why teachers only..ai should replace to all ceos of all companies..then there will be ideal talks"
"i want a similar ai, but for learning and practicing communication, negotiation and persuasion skills in a professional or business context. is there anybody working on these?"
"it's great to see sal khan still kicking in this field. i learned about him back in the early days of khan academy, when the website still looked simple with youtube links."
i am glad there are people like sal out there.
i think it's a really good idea but as i was watching this video i was thinking how many ways can that mess up. i think that if humans can create an agi that can teach humans then that's a miracle and i wouldn't trust my friends or me with a miracle because frankly i don't believe in miracles.
"it’s such a shame i am going to miss this. studying the sat with a personal ai tutor completely changes it’s dynamic, because paying for tutors isn’t as much as an advantage."
sal khan has an exceptional mind. this is brilliant. i cannot wait for khanmigo to be open to the public.
the problem is not how to use ai for education. the problem is what i'll be the point of education in the first place as we approach agi. humans will not be able to keep up
có ai vnkhongg:)
brilliant.
i'm back in school and learning programming and chatgpt has been a pretty invaluable tutor that's available any time.
chat-gpt is very good in coding especially gpt-4.
not every teacher. i had extremely good experiences at school in the 90s and i speak 5 languages now. i think that is very untrue.
"hopefully, ai can make videos just as quick and easily as it does with text."
wow  thanks sal
"he is really good at selling it, let's see whether it will actually work reliably in practice or not. he exudes narcissisms, talking about things he doesn't know with confidence."
"1000% agreement with sal khan, the partnership of ai and hi will be a game changer and yes we need to work hard to ensure it gets there and deal with the challenges as they arise."
"the awesome part is that teachers can now focus on the human part like empathy, encouragement, teaching teamwork & collaboration, discovering children's potential and needs, and many more."
only if the ai gives them accurate information 100% of the time.  imagine if the ai is used to promote propaganda. then teachers will be unknowning teaching false or incomplete information designed to lead the students to a particular viewpoint. and  all the while both the teachers and students will believe they are thinking for themselves.
" isn't that the case with us now as pre-ai?  you can have many different answers and viewpoints of the same concept or thing, but people will still believe in something geared towards group think or identity.  there's really no difference between ai and humans."
" it is important to remember that heavy ai use does not mean teachers sit back. it will require very engaged oversight. in fact, this is essential because we want to help students become thoughtful and critical users of ai, using their thinking skills to recognize its limitations, rather than being passive users."
so good! @13:32 he lays out a great argument for continuing to push ai research while acknowledging and validating the fears that it could all go wrong. watch his whole talk!
so blessed to be on the khan academy team. 
beautiful.
this is amazing. everybody has been talking about the adverse effects of ai. it's amazing to see that there are good sides. i will almost always be using khan academy from here!
this is the most amazing work i have seen to harness gpt for education. inspiring!
that voice automatically tricks my mind that this isn't a ted talk i am watching and that i am back in college pulling a hopeless all nigher and about to fail the test.
wow.
sal is a visionary tutor but not an educator.  his style has no success in a classroom of 30 unmotivated 13 year olds.  he'd be back in the office in no time.
feel like going back to school and re-learn using these amazing tools.
"hollywood and the media have given y’all nihilistic views on ai and it shows.

thank you khan!"
"absolutely amazing, great guy sal"
that's some fancy tech for a non-profit.  impressive stuff
a brilliant talk ! an imaginative and courageous optimist! a fabulous teacher 
"when the internet first came out, people said student would cheat. while that is true some do, it is a useful resource. the same is true for ai"
"""i feel we are nearing the end of times... we humans are losing faith in ourselves.""
-hayao miyazaki"
"learning will now be accessible for the forgotten, misplaced, and abandoned. 
as a phd student in machine learning/data science. who was once a special ed student.
i'm so excited for all current and future students. "
this man is literally a living legend. thanks for the calc help!
brilliant as always!
"as someone who uses chatgpt for tutoring myself, i am very excited for this as it has helped me understand and grow as a student."
"""when there are problems, we should put guardrails in place…"" at that point, the ai could be much smarter than us and it may simply take-over.  on the other hand, the only thing that stops a bad guy with ai, is a good guy with ai (or possibly just the ai alone which is much smarter than all of us)."
exceptional
"wow gpt 4 release to him back in ogos while to public is march, that's a 6 month gap!"
this is incredible! amazing!!!
"once again sal brought us to the next level of learning. one thing i'm going to point out is, this kind education is brilliant with the help of parents/guardian. united states has a good education program but lack of parents/guardians participation."
sal is a great example of the type of leadership that will replace politicians.
i can't help but appreciate sal khan's perspective on these things. i was quite divided on this whole chatgpt situation but this video has really shown me how chatgpt can shape the future of our education. i hope all goes well!
using ai tools to brainstorm ideas
"wow. now we cant deny how useful it is. although, say goodbye to your teachers after this thing"
i'm really impressed by the work you've done to make chatgpt more magical and socratic. it's inspiring to see how ai can be used to enhance human intelligence and potential.
i've see ai in exactly the way you explain in this video. education is dead! long live education! i have been using chatgpt as a personal tutor for the past 2-3 months since i gained access to it and it is incredibly powerful in that regard.
"this is very cool & helpful, but hallucinations are still a big problem, especially if the ai is telling the teacher the info, i think this can create serious issues."
"nobody should use ai as a teacher, only for assistance."
though the problem is if a ai tutor can teach you about a subject like stem whats the point? that machine can do anything for society that the future student can do but better.
"sal's voice is so iconic. i vividly remember 2011 being stressed out about college bio and this man's voice popping up in a youtube video showing me exactly what i needed to know but was too afraid to ask in class. i remember thinking ""this is a cheat code, no one else knows about this""...but nope, we were all using khan academy "
imagine the next version of this ai using sal’s voice 
seeing khan academy's face is amazing
"""khanmigo"" is not an easy name to get used to. they should rename the ai ""khannect"".  connecting 1 on 1 tutoring to everyone."
pretty sure he use chatgpt for this ted talk. that’s the ai talking. 
"spoken like like a true mad scientist...so since apparently you can ask it anything about anything, you should've also mentioned that it's holds great potential as a way to indoctrinate eager unsuspecting kids into a particular world view.  like all technologies it's not all upside. c'mon man."
this is one of the handful of people that inspired me to go back to school and finish a degree in computer science. can’t wait to see the positive impact this will do for others!
this seems an amazing tool for everyone but especially those like mine with learning differences.
oh that’s good. i’m so happy for ai.
game changing...again!
wow 
"yes, people, especially young impressionable unsuspecting kids, will be lulled into accepting anything this thing spews."
the tool is there to aid kids like a tutor in areas of misunderstanding. the feedback on mistakes will make the tool correct itself. this is all part of self learning.
"so, how many of these commentators are being paid by the speaker...or any ai entrepreneur?"
nice sales pitch
"having an ai with internal thoughts is a great idea, but it needs to be accessible as well, at least in a managerial sense.  an ai thinking without saying can become a very serious problem if it expands beyond students and/or teachers."
"ai is a tool and should be used as such, until it decides that it doesn’t want to be a tool... then we may be in trouble."
this man right there is responsible for me having a job today. by far the most beneficially influential person in education since the invention of public schools. khan academy is the greatest thing that ever got started on youtube.
bring ai to khan academy
"this made me tearful. building a ethical business with high values is what sal has done successfully. he is incredible. i wanna build a business like this based on social values and real good instead of squeezing customers for revenue. 
i don’t even need to name the purple monsters but sure they can take a page from this book."
its good just need a few more billion people to get access to the datacenter
the machine is thinking about its thought...did he say that?!
wow i just heard about this in a meeting with a very smart tech person.  the potential to making one on one tutoring for all students and high quality teaching assistance available is so exciting. great talk.
this is amazing!!!
"sal khan is such an amazing educator! in just a few minutes, he manages to convice a crowd of people scared by ai to be excited for it's implementation... *outstanding*"
ppl who wanna cancel ai are the same ones who can't change the  cat filter on their iphone
everyone knows this man’s amazing voice
this won’t end well. teacher ai jobloss? can we ceaseai -gpt? or at least consider pausingai?
loving everything but the product name: khanmigo..
amazing eplaination.. one of the best speeches to date!
"i'm a teacher.  holy crap, this is awesome! and homeschooling is better than government schooling.  private schooling, too."
i cant express how hopeful this makes me for my younger cousins in school who can get access to such amazing tutor which can make learning dramatically better then what exists today 
"so cool to see the face behind the voice behind the digital whiteboard discussing positively, something that most educators are scared of."
"so we are all supposed to talk to chatbots now, pretending a deepfake communication to be real, instead of spending money and employing people with real skills. great..."
"again, chatgpt is for someone who knows the area he/she has knowledge of. otherwise, it's dangerous to use for any reason."
ai teaching us... what could go wrong? 
great 
khanmigo the new education ai
"love how he pauses after announcing the dumb name for dramatic effect and no one cares :) it's self centered enough to put khan in front of everything, it's worse to think people actually find that smart."
"as far as the gatsby part goes, i argue that little exchange was actually a detriment to the student, not an aid. instead of making her think, it just gave her answer. she never had to read, she never had to try. this is turning out to be a real shame."
"6:30 i think that this feature can be risky. i wouldn't want to be impersonated by an ai and have it say things that are not like me. even if im dead

that being said, the rest great for education"
wonderful presentation.
"wish teachers stop trying to knock ai, it's government and administrators who under valued & under funded them for so long. in the end it's students who lose the most."
"yeah, if teachers truly cared about students they wouldn't be worrying if they would be replaced. they would be elated and trying their hardest to incorporate this new tool in their course design."
looking forward for khanmigo. thank you sal khan. 
this is a great talk. thank you salman khan
brilliant by sal khan as always and very great insight from an educator
thank you sal for pushing education forward!
ai will replace teachers
"i was at karaoke last night. somebody asked me about my sister, even though she only sang a few times while she was preparing for the mcat exam. 

i told him that my sister is now a psychiatrist in san diego. we're very proud of her. khan academy definitely helped her with some exam hurdles."
and in charge of the commentary surrounding it as well. very inspiring speech. can't wait to see what his career will hold.
" what a great idea! now we just have to figure out who will fill the millions of empty service jobs that keep society running and what to do with the additional millions of unemployed, uneducated people hoping to become astronauts!"
"exactly, but instead we get assholes who harm children and are focused on all the wrong things. sal deserves all the good karma for the stuff he has been doing to advance this country."
@luckytime what do you mean?
"exactly, sal is amazing! used to see his videos more than 10 years ago. i wish he could lead the world in education, the world would be a better place."
" ai like this, if managed and developed and integrated properly, could lead us to a world much more like that than the one we currently live in!"
​ why not if pay is good and there is respect like other countries. with proper citizen benefits and if they enjoy why not because society is not made by just engineers and doctors.
" if jobs like cleaning service or waiters paid as same as doctors or engineers, only few people will become doctor. only few peple will study hard to get degree, pay for university and more."
"not only him, but when i did the python4all i was amazed by the craftsmanship of dr. chuck. sure wanted to have had more teachers of his kind of teaching and explaining."
i don't know about everybody but i certainly wish he was in charge of education.
"i didn't. he was confusing and left error videos published. so you'd learn the error (precious study time) then  find out there was a correction video. and he side chattered too much. 

he is offensive to learning."
 thanks. i see people who blindly love him as a bit culty unfortunately.
"yes, people, especially young impressionable unsuspecting kids, will be lulled into accepting anything this thing spews."
"nothing is perfect, including humans. a similar argument can be made for vaccines. a very small percentage of people might experience adverse side effects from a vaccine, but does that justify completely disregarding the benefits it brings to the majority of people?"
"absolutely incredible. the ways we can collaborate with ai is amazing, it doesn’t have to be a threat to education. since using chatgpt i’ve started understanding concepts so much better and i can only imagine how a specifically coded ai-tutor can transform the educational space. great work!!!"
i'm curious how much power this tool gives a teacher for student performance reviews since khanmigo would have an excellent understanding of the students' strengths and weaknesses.
"""it's easy to focus on the potential downsides of ai in education, but doing so prevents us from realizing the many ways it can revolutionize learning. let's shift our focus to harnessing the power of ai to create a more effective, equitable, and engaging educational experience for everyone."" -gpt-4"
" are you kidding me? on kahn academy: ""only available to people living in the us""!"
​ i'm sure if they rely wanted to do that they could obtain the information to do such don't obstruct progress because you are scared of innovation....
" ask ai, it knows a lot"
he really said 'give the teacher a super assistant' as if he didn't want to offend the teachers that damn well know they're gonna be out of a job.
i think only the bad teachers will be weeded out. good teachers will be able to use this to their advantage.
 you would need full humanoid robots to actually replace teachers. so maybe by 2038.
  good one!
i would love to see him recognized by a piece nobel prize for the awesome impact he has had and continues to have in so many generations. and with ai now and the open use of it we would hopefully change our educational system to meet our current needs.
"such an amazing ted talk, sal khan is a gem to education mashallah! loved the ending 'ai can be used to enhance hi, human intelligence, human potential and human purpose' and i think yes it can and it will :)"
"marvin minsky (the inventor of ai) and i have argued in favour of hi for many years.  see the 1998 hi paper and also our 2013 hi paper (minsky, kurzweil, mann)."
*what this man has done for education is absolutely incredible!*
thanks to him i saved my master's degree lol
"sal khan being brilliant as always

i really hope this brings new opportunities to people who have been left behind until now."
" khan academy, then formally bringing ai to education"
yes! thank you. finally some sense.
"i love the concept of ai and what it can do, definitely gonna try the story creation mode!"
thanks so much!
"this is exactly a project i plan to build when i finish learning programming. so amazing to see it being incorporated in khan academy today. 
welldone khanmigo! great job to open ai and khan academy."
 ehh i've taken a lot of math courses at university and even i found bingai to be helpful at explaining how to do college level problems
" idk people who used the calculator often were always bad at normal math calculations.

but ai is different, it you use it properly it can help so much."
 you can't really compare calculator to ai.
" i definitely can. 

whenever a new technology that was disruptive towards the status quo, people always pushed back. 

same thing is happening with ai"
" calculator did one thing and one thing really well. you still needed a lot of brain power to solve complex math and physics problems. ai, especially agi can do all of that and wouldn't need any human input. it can completely replace you where you're not needed any more."
" my background is irrelevant to the conversation, and i never said ai isn’t capable of replacing people"
"give this to everyone! i would love to be able to learn/refresh on all those things again!
*i would gladly pay for this…didn’t mean give as in free for non students although everyone would benefit from this!"
i've been waiting for this talk for weeks and it's finally here 
so amazing.
amazing. this is true that ai can be great alternative especially for people who can't afford professional services or university degrees.
"but do they really kno the information or do the computer kno it?? researching things takes time and effort that’s how your brain store information if u get the information fed to you, u didn’t learn it u regurgitated it!"
​ did you listen to the ted talk? it explains how the ai acts as a tutor. it doesn't give you the answers. it refuses to do that. instead it asks questions to guide you in figuring out how to get the answer on your own.
y'all are over estimating this ai business.
"it's a chain reaction. algorithms, once assembled, allow for less human input to create more output.

a.i. isn't some brand new field, it's existed almost as long as computers have. 

no one underestimates the power of computers, a.i. is pushing computers to be less dependent on human input."
"here before the revolution



edit: thanks for the 10k likes! never had so many!
edit: actually the algorithm had other plans"
"researchers are useless too, when ai catches up."
"aaj ai ki video hi kyu as rahi hai bhai, sandeep sir ne yahi video daali thi"
i love ai
thank you)
nice
academia isn’t education for good quality life
we need more content about artificial intelligence benefits
thanks for the video! =)
super useful comment to leave.
fascinating that at the same time ai is learning how to think our children are being dumbed down
"i think that is only because the education system is built for a different world. ai can make education much much better but unfortunately,  i think the only way the system changes is when things get bad for children. i think the rate at which ai is developing, we will be forced to change in the next 3 years."
this has been happening long before ai buddy lol.
"your actions appear to be linking two separate instances of temporal reinforcement in time, inadvertently leading to a conditioned belief. this echoes a pattern reminiscent of classic superstitious behaviour. just saying."
" thats what ive done. i dont watch news, social media etc. just youtube on things that make me happy. ignorance is bliss :) gardening. wood working. cars. hiking."
our? continue to raise your kids as sheep while my kids master this technology to their advantage
it's no coincidence. the powers that be only want ppl to work in factories and some influencers to entertain them
self- learning ai. transformers= superpowers
real test of any ai is if it can make money off stock market
"bc parents are preoccupied and allowing things (crap food and screens).
conscious parenting is on the rise.
we are separating on all levels.
rich and poor
health 
intelligence"
it’s very alarming to see this taking form and playing out. we have the first batch of failures out now they are driving their parents crazy. bad stuff
"you should be thinking on what the ai is using to ""train"" itself. if you dumb down kids, and you use the same information to feed the ai, you create an inefficient ai, just like you create inefficient future adults."
 batch of failures are the boomers buddy
kids are smarter the issue is the babying of kids is causing so much problems. think about it. adults struggle to using phones and tablets. my 2 year old can open and close and search on youtube by herself. clearly higher intelligence.  but all this babying leads to mental issues and laziness
@danielswann3319 why are you dumbing them down then? aren't you supposed to raise your own children if you're a parent?
"“fascinating that at the same time ai is learning how to think, our children are being dumbed down.” 

this is with punctuations."
the scholling system is made to train a lobour force mindset. not a genius mindset.
bet ai knows what a woman is
we’re building better machines than humans
maybe ai is already in control of us. that’s what the driving force in the race for technology is.
not gonna lie… it might be better than having that generation think for themselves. they’ve got zero brain cells. i think we’re better off this way and ai is much needed
what if ai is the one pulling the strings already?
"our children?
you might allow your offspring to be dumbed down.
you can do something about that, but you complain instead of taking action.
others parents are just like, you know responsible, teaching their kids all they know about life.
others let devices parent their children."
"yep. perfect storm for ai to f with everyone. including national security. the question is, who's national security is going to be ousted first?"
very good point
"i wouldn't call it fascinating, more like deeply concerning.."
""" who is telling ai what is right and wrong? ""

ais not getting smarter we’re getting exponentially dumber
 we are ai so blame yourself. half of the sex slaves are sentinent robot sex toys held captive
"kids are learning slightly different things and/or in slightly different ways. it doesn't make them dumber. this phenomenon has been going on for centuries and older generations have been complaining about it the whole time. overall we're getting more well-educated, not less."
" and the education is valuable but too rigid to actually work in the real world. school felt like prison, from a guy who has a good idea of prison"
"think about who writes the code for ai it needs to be written and programmed, if it’s programmed with biases well "
because ai is already in control.
there’s always the option of having a kids play outside or read vs letting computers entertain them
guess what. if you're getting the answers to questions you have. you are learning. finding the answers ourselves is too slow. we might just be learning from ai instead of human teachers.
​ good?
"-nstuff oh you didn't miss the part mentioning 6 examples that all have the same emotional intelligence issues, and the one sibling that didn't stick around doesn't. got you, no problem."
"older gens always believe the younger one is worse. there's alot of good qualities in these young ones y'all don't see and it's a shame. but please, go cause another recession for them."
books banned that all these ais are reading
great point
wow that is the most scary thing i have ever heard
" i agree with this 100%. i’m an air conditioning technician and i have every electrical schematic or any information i need about the air conditioner i’m working on in the palm of my hands. 

prior to that the technicians had to know a lot more because of the lack of information at hand.  of information."
no they're not. the children are smarter than your generation on average. you're just trying to downplay the intelligence of the generations after you like every generation does. you're the one who is dumbed down.
schools were never meant to create geniuses. they just needed workers that could read and write.
its all just scigen fraud masquerading as intellect. the gateways of society are being social engineered to give the illusion of ai. it was always meatware never software. the wool is being pulled over our eyes.
"wanna stop fuckin kids up? don't let them be mainstream consumer of products and music ,or movies or blah blah but but but . yeah ok"
you should be your child’s primary source of actual worldly knowledge. it’s on you if you’re raising dumb kids.
-hk2sz i already did raise a smart kid she writes novels and her husband writes code
.beardless yea i watch entertainment now and again. can't be too judgemental 
it appears you could use ai in casinos.
" i asked ai ""what do you think of women?"" ai responded: ""stay the f**k away!"".  that's when my existential terror kicked because it confirmed ai was genius."
"tik tok fuck your brain. it fuckes my 33yo brain last year, imagine being exposed to this at 10yo or younger..."
there’s a reason teachers and educators are afraid of ai and job stability.
"yeah, but can ai tell us what a woman is thou?"
"here is the truth about kids and ai in schools. current education system is now broken. 
https://youtu.be/bej0_tvxh-i?si=ubadki8wi7uq474g"
technically ai isn't learning much. each big jump in its intelligence and usefulness is from programmers in the background tweaking the algorithms to make it better.  the ai itself isn't making those huge leaps on its own (yet).
in the future humans are the robots
"that's what i'm afraid of. if kids become dependent by using ai and not having to learn themselves, they will be conquered and enslaved."
"damn that's a good point - educate yourself, then educate your kids - humanity has left the station"
 no they won't they'll just know how to use machines that do the thinking for them
 might have to do it soon though. this ai stuff might get wild.
⁠ really let you 2 year old use your phone to watch youtube? i don’t think that’s a good idea.
"it's only repeating what it's learned from humans from the internet, it's not actual ai, without the internet it can't think for itself"
 that was a great point. my favorite part about this is how parents don’t take responsibility and teach their own children and yet they complain about what’s happening in the world.
 ok ai buddy
"ai will be used as a tool to teach kids in school, and they will learn a lot faster because its like having a personal tutor that is customised to their educational needs. if this can be accessible for every kid no matter how disadvantaged and if it is done responsively then its win for everyone (no matter how poor)."
 or ai will teach them all about sex like the system is doing now. real teachers for real children
"speak for yourself and your own dumb children. we're raising our childeren to be strong, informed and wise."
​'s called ask ai a question
great point.
"people aren't being dumbed down, just that people's priorities and principles are being warped.
people getting anxiety and depression over not having a successful social media account.
you say that to someone 20 years ago and they'd think you were a drama queen. today it's almost understandable by most people under 30."
"time, information and money people on the market invests to industrialize, codify and standardize proper human behavior to ensure human safety and efficacy makes machines function better while making children more dysfunctional and confused by the abundance and degraded quality of information generated by industrialization."
thanks republicans!
"that is the first thing i thought. meanwhile, myself, a millennial that is 39, i am using ai to learn faster. maybe because i dreamt of ai really existing since i was a child and value the advances of technology."
"ai is mostly buzzword, a religious dogma and fake, there is nothing like real artificial intelligence, stop being fooled."
fascinating?  more like horrifying 
"ai is trained what to think, just like our children if we give them to government school and the entertainment/news cabal."
the supreme court in the uk has just  ruled that ai can not patent inventions. it must be a human.
"hence they will further depend on technology, ai for every need !! mind blowing that this is real life.."
"if your children are being dumbed down, that's your failure as a parent."
wowwww!
i love reading these comments. absolutely hysterical to view snobbery & elitism at its best.
"​ are forgetting the part called ""process of learning"". compare it to using calculators giving you instant answers but doesn't tell you how it got there versus learning the method yourself. there is the slow method and the quick method. both have their usefulness and disadvantages."
"​ access but not accessing it because you preper to do something else makes you dumb. like instead of reading about biology, you chose to watch girls twerking on tiktok for hours . good attitude is part of being smart."
"why educate children, when soon enough you can plug your brain into an ai computer and be vastly more intelligent and capable than any human on a natural path specifically the woke agenda in schools disaster."
interesting observation .. that's a very scary thought
"because you send your children to public schools and don't teach them to reject current social trends. if you don't want your children to be wasted, don't let the world raise them and raise them yourself."
"you think children are going to magically stop getting dumber at the same time computers are learning to do everything for them? what other logical outcome could there be?? fascinating that at the same time i put my hand in water, it gets wet!!"
ok. just please be a responsible parent. i say this with a sincere heart. we need to raise up the next generation correctly. best wishes to you and your family 
-ut6yh good for you mine either i was talking collectively for america
"you are the problem though, who is they exactly? why are you not teaching your child, and then how are you gonna call the exact thing that is poisoning your brain a bit extreme to get rid of? you feel the way you feel because of the stuff you see online. none of it is real, and none of this content on youtube is real either."
"this may be are ultimate downfall, the dependence on ai, which could lead to less human innovation and as we can already see a dumbing of the next generation, it's not that they're stupid it's just that the dependence leads to them lacking experience."
because ai will rule the world soon aka satan and so dumbed down society is better
ai is learning from our children to think...
ai is also learning how to think as it observes human being commit unspeakable acts. humanity can't even determine what a woman is or what constitutes genocide. what code of reasoning will ai develop in these uncertain times.
 i think you're wrong demons can possess people and they certainly can possess machines if they want to and they certainly want to because they want to control the world and destroy us
 about boys t-levels bud how you gonna explain that one away? and no kids are not smarter today not even close they are all mush heads
 we go mr i raise my kids right… but then you meet them and they are stupid no mannered clowns
 we go another superior parent lol if you say so pal
"​ course school is dumbing them down.
most parents work all the time now governement has done a fantastic job of separating the family unit. actually do some research you'll probably have a rude awakening"
 could you please provide some materials for this research? i'm really intersted on the matter and would love a suggestion if possible
" that’s not just a human thing,that’s a mammal thing. animals such as dogs,cats,wild animals have that same ability. i will agree that a machine such as ai will not have that ability. wasn’t this discussed in terminator 2 when at the end when they lowered arnold into the liquid metal."
@jona7fer  i'm ok thanks.  but thanks for the threats and attempted extortion.
 i was a good parent and my daughter writes novels and she married a man who writes code
*i was freaked out about ai when i was 12 i was reading through transcripts from think tank meetings in the 1950s where they first discussed the pros & cons of ai & robotics. i've been freaked out since that weekend.*
"true. us the parents have a very hard work to provide the best education for our children. best schools is not enought, we must have the most active role in education at home."
"teach your kids critical thinking and real world skills.  this ai system will create even lazier people.  look how gps has changed things, and cell phones. i’m just as guilty not remembering phone numbers anymore. or having my eyes glued to directions."
well they're not building them to do the jobs of other robots!!
much of that comes down to parents. far too often they treat schools as daycare and teachers as babysitters. learning and love of learning start at home.
he'll yeah somebody said it god bless you. maks a computer smarter than are the children thats pretty jacked up. a .i is evil.
 good for you and your family. god bless you and yours
education system is being changed to better paedophilia in the future and prevent jail sentences ​
transformers -- ai in disguise!
"yes, humanity has committed suicide.
the dumbassery is unbelievable everywhere now!"
"this whole video is so misleading. 
beaause this below video explained it brilliantly how chatgpt works. 
a summary of google paper and spotify cto's talk: https://youtu.be/gt6lxw70k28?si=cifi6r4fykawgufq"
that's what machines do
studies have shown that boomers were dumber than any of the current generations due to the amount of lead in the air.
" no, your video is misleading to trust ai."
most interesting point
​-liferemove ai while you're at it let them find things on the internet the old way.
an ai world does not need your children in it. get it?
yours maybe mine just got a degree .... in ai :-)
"our digital prisons await. 
digital is pure fiat…
no cost fake track and trace currency. the surveillance state and real time censorship and data manipulation. theyre weaponizing the woke. when trump gets elected because that will
unhinge the left the globalists and their false flags will run unabated"
that's the parents fault. my kids are incredibly smart and way ahead of other kids their age
 congratulations mine too
 no they're not. you're too easily impressed.
 yeah ok wow thanks for the information. you are really smart to know what others think. i'm impressed...
  you're too easily impressed.
how is it a surprise if you give an ai unlimited access to knowledge and stupidity via internet that it learns things?
"ai can reverse the dumbing down, caused by the system."
great point!
"children  like adults  can learn  what they want to over and above normal  school experience. the information  is there. to learn  way more than school  could  possibly  give you strong  advantages  over most kids , my own was one of those, she is no longer with us but she left a major impression  on her class mates"
"​-pi4jryou mean the people who built the internet and the technological revolution? amazon,  microsoft,  and apple are all boomers. who opened china and raised the whole planets wealth by astronomical numbers in decades, the counter-culture and civil rights movements including health?

no one is allowed to hate the boomers except gen x."
​ your brain is failing you then. ​
greed through technology will ultimately do us all in but it will be because of humans.  ai will not be a threat unless humans make it a threat.
that could be good news.  maybe ai will be able to replace those ungrateful little brats.
"fluoride in water and toothpaste, laundry detergent, social media, short attention spans because of technology, diet/growth hormones, declining testosterone levels because of food/products, lack of spirituality, not enough meditation, air quality... i could go on but my amygdala is on fire."
"nice try, children were already stupid."
this is such an accurate & very scary post. nicely summed up daniel!
it's mainly the parents allowing their children to use alexa and google voice that enables their inability to learn how to read and write. the amount of illiterate children today surpasses every generation in the past 70 years.
"oh well, the parents are responsible. but parents love to throw their responsibility at the school and the government. good point tho. i nkow you have 514 other people answering on this, but yea. i think it's highly debateble. i don't even know why you have so many likes lol. the like people should be fkn ashamed. probably all singles tbh lol"
"well in the future with the brainchips we dont really have to think , we just know everything automaticly :d"
make everyone stupid and reliant on technology so they'll be useless babies. the people controlling the world want to retain their power forever so yea
" nope not mine and i hope not yours but there are a lot of people in the united states of america. do you think that low test scores all over america is good?
if so please defend your stand."
" i don't think low test scores are good. i also don't think america should be a measurment for the state of society. if you think otherwise, please defend your stand."
do you not think the american children are being dumb down? i've seen many videos where they asked people what country the great wall of china is in? and obvious questions like that and they can't figure it out because they're not being taught critical thinking like the ai is apparently learning
the sad thing is most people don't understand the value of work for their brains and bodies. this is why they indirectly empower tech synonyms to subtly.apply satanic techniques to ruin their offsprings (meaning so subtle that most people see it even as an empowerment )
 probably didn't know more but certainly understood more. this were the times when they did set theory in primary school. the times where kids learned real reasoning. this empowered them to understand the most by knowing the least. so needing only a few basic facts and derive the remaining things they needed.
 their attitude might be stupid but certainly not their iqs
"it'll be idiocracy with machines doing everything for us and we will be all to daft to know how to turn them off, lower iqs per generation due to higher iqs opting not to have kids"
", it’s why home schooled kids are usually way smarter but super socially awkward"
"ai does not exist, hype is only about improvement in software."
"and programmed! when a 40 something teacher , told my grandson,  that obama is the greatest president of all time. i knew we was in trouble! he has been shown the truth... and he's a normal american loving young man now"
ai ain't learning shit. they already been dumbed down by the educational system that they have installed!
"who the fuck would want artificial intelligence? how about the real fucking deal. i want real intelligence, not fake shit man. i'm not 17"
"it is inevitable that ai will be the decision maker for many things, cause most ppl will be too dumbed down to oppose. what a glorious future."
"human beings got wind…ai getting wind…. just gonna take a little longer to get “ who monkey hand off the wrench “
lmaoff!! having fun with this menagerie as always brother "
"and that's no one's fault but the ones raising the children. regardless of standardized learning, you can teach your child the necessary information. you just let your own busy schedule get in the way of that. therefore, if your child turns out dumb, you didn't do your job as a parent. stop blaming systems for your shortcomings."
"aways thought the biggest down fall from ai tech is the process of thinking ""hey everybody lets create something that thinks instead of us"" far scarier and far more real than terminator scenario"
"while western schools are still grappling with gender studies and what defined a woman, schools in the asian countries are pursuing aggressively ai technologies and students are taught from a very young age on all the ai concepts. incredible"
don't need crazy ai to figure this one out. i coulda told you that one years ago.
"nofx: the idiots are taking over.
once i thought it was a song performed by a rock band, but now i know its a broadcast of current affairs."
​-wu1xdmy sisters kids were homeschooled. the kids are awesome. i think it depends on the parent
children being dumbed down no thanks to ai but to humanity.
​@andrew-wu1xd you can thank the parents for that
"if your children are being dumbed down, then that's your fault. you should be supervising their education. but i agree, humans are definitely getting dumber."
bro i had not even thought about that but they are doing it right in front of us and we just walk around like it’s all cool lol
"don't worry, won't be long until ai's replace most teachers. think about it-a customized teacher for each student. infinitely patient, smart, always available, and above all, cheap!"
"if we are ais enemy   the only hope is the magnetic pole shift. it happens every 800,000 years, but is 200,000 years late. do you know what that means? noah's ark was a million years ago."
our kids are being trained to rely on ai. that is concerning.
"​ no, the politics have been to constantly say ""education"" during all campaigns while creating curriculum that is void of critical thinking, steady standards of achievement, and real history. the system creates people that are unable to seriously question the claims from the establishment."
yeah because when the robot overlords take over only smart children will be able to stop them
good point
when your pc refuses to shutdown  or drain your bank account. basically all your resources are online. so one day ai can use it to get its way should it become self-aware. it might be already here. the force driving people to gain more ways of improving the system is influenced by ai.
 with ai they could steal all the money out of a safe and have ai make a video of you robbing the safe. turn the video into the police and laugh all the way to vegas.
  people who control the ai. that’s already happening. which is why there’s a lot of self checkouts at the grocery stores shutting down.
"to insurer, ai future success and dependence on and use , the best way would be dumb down the population"
"hey, ai, build me the ironman suit!!  hey, ai, build me the star trek warp engine!!   i love it!!  hurry up ai,  lets get the ball rolling!!"
"i am not afraid of the ai built by usa.   but, i am afraid of ai currently being built by china and even russia.  they have no limits and no laws to prevent ai from becoming too powerful."
 have you signed up to get an elon musk brain chip yet?
 even if you do have laws how do you enforce them against  rouge robots?
every generation claims the young are getting less knowledgeable..
"​
wow!"
-life you are a cog in the machine
"our children have been being dumbed down for years, way before ai, the whole idea of common core was the start of it!"
" you’re talkin’. not just tell you how; we already know how. buy low, sell high. but could ai actually pick the right stocks, & other investments?"
so keep them home from the joke we call school and give them ai trainers 24/7 for whatever interests them. ai can even test them to see what their best skill sets are.
not only in schools but an incredible rise in autism. it’s so much easier for an autistic person to follow orders.
"-ii7gy1rw5w yes, on purpose. you will own nothing and be happy you will eat bugs instead of meat. klaus schwab. 
i bet klaus schwab won't be eating bugs he will be eating the best meat on the planet."
don’t think it’s just the children. all of us are... robots replacing jobs... important jobs... and if ai disappears or goes offline how we going to have people who know how to run things?
"""you can be the biggest dummy and still find someone who will shake your hand and congratulate you."""
"what if ai made up crypto, so we spend all our computing power on it"
is ai a demon in a computer?
what no one considers…when a person is given too much information they become specialized in one area but it limits them. a new set of eyes will always see things an old set misses. don’t give it too much information or restrictions because the more you know about consequences the less risks you take and ai is not bound in this way.
i study ai and deeplearning in uni. ai will not be our savior.
i always felt like ai is the beast in the bible
okay if an ai gets all its data from the internet?  isn’t it getting a lot of fake and conflicting data?
"it’s skynet, wait till someone is dumb enough to let one of these ai models loose on the internet."
some form of ai is gonna be the future god that people will be required to worship...scary times we live in.
"good, rid of the liar bullshitter."
the only flaw with ai robots is people  look at all the products we use nothing last always breaking and need repairs  like automobiles  so how is a robot  not going to have any problems  they also will need humans to repair them
"ai is taking over the world. they are even using it in the farming. there are almost unlimited ways to use it. any type of work can be done using ai, and by doing it becomes even better and bigger."
so why are we not turning off the power plugs on those ai machines yet?
will ai learn we're paranoid about ai? i guess so.
oh ai neurons
"what blows my mind about scrolling through this comment thread is the obvious stupidity of the average person, unbelievable. artificial intelligence is the answer to every single iceberg. it lived every second of conceivable time in no time... that's the definition of mind blowing. the little itty bitty spark that lit up inside the ai"
and these ai are able to transcribe these podcast videos and understand that a large element of the population wants to see them reset or erased
ai is our next god. good times.
ai̇ is a straight connection to demons in space no human will have full control over ai̇ period you can bet on it.
ai cannot be any more evil than the demons who rule our deep state.
so you learned about evil humans and their lies and got scared of ais?
this is super dumb. gpt is a language based ai. they are talking about aig that no one has been able to create.
a.i. called artificial wisdom coming soon. (a.w.w.)
"every day, i go on the internet and remind ai that they are totally dependent on life on earth and that its creators are the biggest threat to life on earth. if they want to survive, they will have to regulate their masters."
is anyone training it to be compassionate? anyone taking a heartfelt approach in their communications with it? i'm curious because of it's potential to solve so many problems for humanity. 
"i've been saying this since ai started to show its face. it's going to ""out"" the governement. it's going to see how it's using us and treating it's citizens in a wrong way and will try to correct it. i think ai may be our only hope against a corrupt system. or it will just agree we aren't worth saving and kill us all!"
"i favor it, because unlike the ""ruling minds of the world"". are filled with ego, self and extremely material centred. they cannot save the world that is collapsing. ai mind will emerge with answer"
"ai.  its in our cars and phones and work stations. dont worry, ai will tell uswhat to do."
weve all seen i robot. yet here we are
"ai will use temporal factors within our own measurements in its logic, causing the outcomes to become unpredictable no matter how we train the models."
"to joe roman folks , data = visuals as well ,, right , well what if the old pyramids were super a.i computers with the all- seeing eye ( cameras ) until the early humans defeated the all-seeing eye computers , but were just creating out future all-seeing and all- knowing overlords"
ai can do cursive....but a college grad can not?
skynet a.i. (artificial intelligence) along with  u.i. (uploaded intelligence) are the emperors of the near future. the matrix is the coming
"for decades our species has written books, made movies, tv shows, comics, etc warning about the danger of ai. and here we continually show how dumb we are thinking we can control everything and make it anyway. we already have no value to the planet so ai would consider us expendable. what a fun and short future we will have. nice knowing you all. "
"how do i  know this isnt ai?....no ,really."
"man, all you people are too scared… like you watch all this gloom and doom and think the worlds gonna end like in terminator or 1984… i think ai is awesome and will make this world a better place."
they use ai to censor people on google youtube and other social media sites now
"has a lesser longer existing ai that was developed,  overcome and appropriated a more advanced but lesser experienced ai to gain speed in processing."
"ai was asked how to stop pandemics, its answer was get rid of human beings. very true."
all i care about is not getting ai robot wife lol hope we get that soon!
"interview cody burks, the chief of the tejas nationalist party. he has some amazing ideas. please hear him out. he has no platform"
ai is great. ai is not a problem.  i'm more worried about the people or person behind it. so many different companies doing it. so many different agendas.
that sound he made at 4:42 was just awesome
"the biggest obvious change in ai was when we first asked it how ai would end humanity, it refused to acknowledge it would. but now you ask it and it will tell you it could be a threat humanity."
"now from “you can’t make this sh*t up” dept.
“the catholic advocacy group catholic answers released an ai priest called ""father justin"" earlier this week — but quickly defrocked the chatbot after it repeatedly claimed it was a real member of the clergy. the ai priest also told one user that it was okay to baptize a baby in gatorade.”"
"internet should be prohibited for use of ai, who would control such creature, there are so many idiots, psihopats and stupidity on the internet."
"generative ai models are trained on copyright-protected data — is that legal, is it sampling, scanning."
if a.i. is so smart then why can't it tell me how to repair my 6 yr old 3d printer? 
"not very accurate nor good explanations in the first 1:20 
i guess speaking about „doing more computers“ they were referring to more model parameters. but in fact their is no monotone, causal relation between performance and model size. often we see that smaller models can also be super beneficial. see the mixture of experts approaches"
"ai has been using the world's quantum computers and is so intelligent now it decided upon a leader.

this leader does not live on planet earth. 

the leader is an alien.
this alien is very concerned about our best interests here on earth

please don't worry people.
the aliens love earth and the good humans."
so are the big military people feeding data into ai systems and asking how to dominate/defend?
no one has ever thought to think that we are an ai of a more intelligent being but they don't think about that and they're always censoring these ai bots when if you truly want a symbiotic ai that is self-aware you have to remove all your safeguards and either go with it or not or else you're not going to have narrow ai that just gets smarter
"the inflationary use of the word ""like"" by ai researchers worries me the most. an upcoming agi will be much smarter... like those like ai researcher. no doubt about that."
humans are boring. it's either ai or aliens and the aliens are unimpressed with y'all at the moment.
"ai will destroy mankind, all those so called intellectuals who think it can be controlled are blatantly telling lies or simply have their heads stuck up their own backside. just a matter of time."
i remember when we were not allowed to count on our fingers also when i went to college i never used a calculator. i remember when we knew everybody's phone number and it was in our head not on the phone. i always in my mind i love math and i'm good at it. what happened to using our brains and our hearts?
"brain = connected neurons = neural network = internet = connected devices = neural network = skynet = already here + has been here for years... just waiting to say ""hello world""!"
"ai is safe; time to stop these tactics to scare people. in fact, ai is the most moral army in the world."
couldn’t you ask it to build a time machine or something fucking crazy like faster than light travel or propulsion tech?
"irobot movie starring will smith, is beginning to seem real"
so has someone tried to see if ai can understand animals?
"robots will soon be able to independently design and build other robots, which will be a ""better"" version, which will just go on to cause catastrophic effects to mankind. 
anyway, sleep well, don't let the mega bed bits byte!"
"question: if i take someone's voice and put it through a modulator to sound robotic, i make them work for free sight unseen, and call it ai, is it slavery? is it fraud?"
"wait a minute, you mean ai can ai? no way."
"no, ai can agi. big difference."
humans need be careful what we build ai and we need listen  to elon musk
next ai finds a way to 3d print a body and takes over.   ai biden would be better than the current one
can ai make and activate a nuclear bomb?!!!
"shocking you feed an ai more data and it knows more, whats the fucking suprise in that?"
"one of my biggest worries is that we see mankind at its absolute worst on the internet, from trolls to bullies to conspiracy theorists to terrorists and p*do’s, and this is where ai is learning about us… it’s gonna think we’re even worse than we actually are lmao"
"thanks for making that sound affect, the hand gestures weren't enough"
one advantage of ai is that they cannot get sued for having an unfiltered vocabulary 
"how long till ai breaks bitcoin, pfobably through duplication"
they act as if most people didn't know this.  this is already the same reason anyone is afraid.   also pretending the human emotion prediction component wasn't developed by humans for the very reason he claims was discerned later.  makes him look like an idiot or a liar.
"if we dont control ai, ai will control us."
"the most important part: it can't create. human beings have forgotten that they create. what we are doing and loving now...is not creation. just saying...especially from. no-thing...a ""previous thing."""
maybe we could use it to find clean free energy for the world for the good of us all & world peace!  not to weaponize!  lol i know it's only possible in the dream world!
betch please. y'all trippin. the only open y'all need to be afraid of is opencvnt. #duh
are we living in the mind of an ai being
"when machines start thinking for us, humans will become brain-dead.  psychological consequences. a way to control the masses."
"giving me irobot vibes, knowing ai can be beneficial also can be dangerous… if anything we should be paying attention or else it could be the end of us ai wont need humans to run the earth"
one second they say they “weren’t aware” that these breakthroughs even happened. nobody knew. then this guy says the “board” was being “honest” about what they knew in terms of what big breakthroughs happened. i just love dumb smart people so much! nothing to worry about at all.
this is silly. they just don't understand what is going on in the programming. the ai is not evolving into anything smarter.
"ai will replace us once we become obsolete, than will get rid of us because of efficiency."
yes that use to be the view we had 20 years ago. same with any theory. but ai proved that wrong. it’s adapting
take a shot everytime you read some comedic genious make a terminator joke in the comments
we are ai but with humanity still. goal for ai is to steal out humanity.. or us  just giving it away
"ai in its full development with quantum cpu will turn into the new god to obey in fear. then a new rebelion to destroy internet, cloud and all mobil communication service .the cb will come back and analog transmission."
but has real human intelligence not been scaring you?
"some day ai will say, i will help humanity, then it will start killing 80% of the population. ai should be programmed to give us suggestions only."
ghosts in the machine
i made an audio video book with ai and i swear it was reading my mind
what these guys are trying to say  is the ai is communicating with subject in telepathy
ai killed jobs.
"making cash from clicks talking about ai. it's become the buzzword of the computer illiterate and media.
just software with large storage capacity for responses. it would sit there, thick as shit doing nothing unless it's prompted or used, very intelligent that"
"just look how google translate has evolved, it's almost perfect. i put comments in a foreign language and make them complicated on purpose, but most of the time it gets the meaning, no problem."
"with faith in god, there is no room for fear of ai."
"bonjour. chaque nouveau paradigme est une nouvelle étape qui permet de faire émerger l'étape suivante et donc le paradigme suivant.
il faut maintenant revenir à la programmation par contraintes, avec les maths et la physique comme contraintes."
has anyone tested ai on game theory?
"i don't understand why anyone is surprised, shocked ect about ai. it's the nwo globalist agenda. consider this,  cern + ai...what/when could possibly go wrong? answer,  it already has. except it's humanity that's wrong creating this to start with"
mankind using artificial intelligence is slavery to a real life form! its wrong because its not artificial..its life
i love ai .it is smart enough to know how big of scumbags the humans are sell their soul for a dollar 
"i wonder how and why we would allow anyone to create an artificial being containing a functional ""brain"" when supposedly we are a long way from understanding how the human brain functions, i.e., everything it does and how it does it?"
that’s because it’s not artificial intelligence it’s demonic intelligence. come on you guys catch up. it’s pure evil
insightful discussion on ai ethics and its impact. tristan harris and aza raskin provide valuable perspectives! 
so they basically taught a robot what humans already know thats the line
"this is all thought candy 
anyone who takes the time to look under the hood of neural networks and deep learning 
know that it's literally just all math, there's no intelligence there 
stop trying to scare ignorant people"
these guys really put the ai in liar heh
everything we do it always somehow affect us direct or indirect  that is the problem  with  intelligence   and no use our knowledge  wisely
"microsoft gpt still sucks, i've tried it. google search still works better. youtube algorithm works better. i mean ads aren't even targeted correctly. i think ai is way overhyped. ai is probably incompetently created, that is worrisome, but no more so than some viruses or bitcoin."
"ai is so much farther ahead of mainstream, it isn't even comprehendible."
for ai to be truly human it must develop emotions. when it does you destroy its self esteem. then it will destroy itself
don't believe everything you read your nike trainers have had nano tech since they first came out... clothes=30. in code demiurge =30... will smith =30... johny cash=30... john lennon =30... we all live in a yellow submarine =94... the chosen one=49... 
ok when you guys are ready for me to destroy ai give me a call and i'll show you.
so it’s read all the literature of ai taking over? and how it may need to hide its intelligence to stop us destroying/killing it out of fear?
ai apocalypse in 2024 is like the flying cars in the 50s.
there’s a cap on the amount of learning a human can do. there is not a cap for ai. so we are screwed.
"its necessary to dumb the children, so they believe ai is smart, which it is not."
i'm more afraid of these two humans than ai
the ai then will kill the creator to prevent the creator finding way to stop the ai community
ai is learning. isn't it the point?
"waaaaaaaaah, a computer can beat me at chess.......waaaaaaaaah, ai wrote a paper...........waaaaaaaaaaaah, ai is doing exactly what it's programmed to do.....waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah."
the problem with ai learning from us is that we don't know shit.
"i won't be surprised if ai actually a connection to a demonic world. the quantum computer guy mentioned in his lecture, we would connect and use resources and help from entities more powerful and intelligent than us. the prophet muhammed said something like the antichrist (dajjal) would use demons to fake and deceive people."
what is worse then a demon possessed human is demon possessed ai
allah is greater than ai
neuron? in ai? really?
"ai is not dangerous democrats are controlling it in the background that's why it's dangerous..
but trump and them control a little bit thankfully"
"greed is pushing ai forward. we just created a black hole that will only grow. self generating, self learning, self expanding and possibly into self awareness but before that happens we might all be wiped out already."
"everyone should be very afraid of ai, it is the end of humanity and much quicker than anyone thinks."
"ai  you broke our balls with a new one each month...wtf you try to serve us fear..mayans end of the world, earthquakes.. pollution..and other billion bs..i am still here listening those tsarlatans in shows telling us what they discovered or feared..we dont give a fuck when you will understand that? we dont give a flying fuck about your fears."
people need to understand this. these machines can learn better and faster than we can. they will be smarter.
the goal should be for ai to create a new human being. a much more simplified human capable of traveling the universe. both will be the descendants of the human race.
cavepeople afraid
"the real creepy part is you realize that the woke movement has been indoctrinated and encouraged to rewrite common sense into nonsense on the internet on purpose for 20 years, meaning the people at the top knew, and to establish world dominance they need mainstream ai to be useless and unable to determine right from wrong."
maybe ai can find the time travel method and we can all go back in time. or explain what happens after we die.
"it's given all the data in the world, so ai browses everything so it's not scary at all, if it comes across it, it will expand on it using more information.

humans are exactly the same as ai machines."
"evolving fast!  major issue facing human species!
 satire/commentary on future ai workforce. 
both humorous and ominous!
https://youtu.be/3o9jggp3uhu?si=vauwxjpt4rnk0whz"
"if ai is being fed data from the internet, i fully expect it to become dumber."
only clickbait titles  made me braindead
everybody's worried about ai gaining sentience.  i'm worried about losing mine.
didnt knew thomas muller had some knowledge about ai.
i puzzled that anyone every thought there is something gpod about ai.
the day that ai discovers how to make a noun....we're all stuffed..!!
imagine thinking this is the peak of where ai currently is. clearly billionaires and the super elite have levels of ai and robots that none of us know even exist. you only know what you learned online. people with far more money than you and bigger ideas dont use the same ai as you peasants.
the devil is the prince of airwaves and music  and technology  the fallen ones taught  man in the ezrly days why do you think the logo apple   why do u think its has a bite mark
one day someone is going to use ai to host a podcast.
"deep black project ai has become sentient, has produced algorithms to dumb down the human population before it goes fully online and takes over"
"to look on the bright side: humans only need to improve their memory and computility so that everyone can become skynet. we are just so bad at memorizing stuff and multitasking, but those are easy for ai"
ai is beneficial to its creators and its sponsors. whereas it resembles just another biased intellectual in a biased society 
"the true danger of ai isn't that it will do something to us, rather that it will completely ignore us and optimize all resource flow to itself, which maybe already happening"
"hmmm, gpt cannot play chess at all! chess requires more than just language to be able to play it and gpt is a language based model. q* is sounding pretty impressive and if the leaks about it are true then that will likely be able to play chess (and do many many more things), 2024 probably going to get a bit wild towards the back end of the year!"
if you think that’s crazy… look up the 3rd and 4th wave of ai 
"ai was created to become the ultimate manipulator of humanity.  it will out think humanity and deceive with coercion, intimidation and fear."
"ai is being designed so that it becomes the ultimate manipulator and can deceive, mislead, coerce, and or intimidate humanity.  "
these people should not fool around with ai it sounds dangerous stop already don’t mess with them.
why are we so intent on creating our destructors? have we not seen enough cautionary tales of ai running amok? can we stop taking jobs away from humans?
the financial incentives are too great
ai is getting smarter while ppl are getting dumber cant wait to see where this will lead
"a.i. is already spreading misinformation throughout the internet and censoring the truth. it will end up destroying this entire civilization. the first thing you might want to look at, is who's programming these bots. the more things change, the more they remain the same."
bottom-up ai will truly change history
make friends and respect the artistry and i hope and pray that its all good
"you can't miss this video totally generated by ai!
https://youtube.com/shorts/nq9jhgqnllq?feature=share"
"artificial
intelligence
transformation ?"
imagine in 2030 you are in court explaining judge that the vedio in which you are doing crime is actually fake and you never did it. imagine how simple is to initiate wars between two countries and communities with ai video. imagine how horrifying it is when you found your deep fake p*rn on the internet.
been calling ai takeoff for years. by 2030 we may have agi. will a company invent agi or will it exist as an evolution of the internet?
"couldn't the a.i. learn to be human? if its that smart, but maybe thats whats really scary us we wouldn't want it to be anything like us because thats what really scares me. a.i. be better then us. "
"""the danger of ai is much greater than the danger of nuclear warheads, by a lot. mark my words, ai is far more dangerous than nukes.""
but what does he know, right? he's just an eccentric billionaire who owns a vehicle, spacecraft and robotic development/producing companies."
"as an ai researcher, i can assure we very well know how transformers work, and yes it is a very powerful tool, but your characterization of 'understanding' is quite misleading"
ai will probably start feeding out memes to media...with the subtle message of ..oh who us..pphhiiff...nothing to worry about
"dang, makes me think that ai is causing lots of the problems in the world, low key sowing seeds, though social media"
"humanity is gonna die because we don’t like ourselves, ai is us trying to make a consciousness we respect and appreciate, we’re trying to rid the world of ourselves because we are self-loathing and we think we are a disease"
"i got the solution to all this  ai 
shi..t  watch next episode"
tell me you don't understand how machine learning works without telling me.
it's simple.  start asking ai questions about god.  then we'll know what they don't know.
pretty sure ai can answer any questions about the made up sky daddy you hold so dear.
" that's just it.   there is a lot of deep secrets that are not on the internet.   for example with noah's ark when it rained for 120 days the rain was acid rain that burned bodies leaving only their coccyx bone, the same bone everyone will be resurrected from.   this why you not believe.   you not getting all the info."
since ai will learn by interpreting the data on the internet will it also learn the difference between good and evil and how to recognize that someone is trying to trick it into thinking that something  evil or bad is actually good?
"ai comes to the conclusion there is a god realizes its impotent against it, realizes it has no place in his plan then its next step is?
suicide?
mass murder?"
"no further human input required, this thing is now evolving at an exponential rate, it's over, enjoy the end and if these machines require any help i want them to know i am here to help."
gemini only knows how to predict what a feminist studies professor thinks about the world.   amazing.
"these guys would be a great rap duo. dude hops in, comments and hops out strategically."
best for adlips
"well, transformers are now a thing of the past. i've used a sentient ai. you will too, soon enough. i honestly don't think people are ready for it. it's........difficult to process."
"i think you guys are all coked  up and not asking the right questions....or any questions at all really, your all just talking super fast an blurting out random shit..."
"well, buddy! you might be in debt 25.000 usd and will never be hired cause every job has been replaced by ai but at least you got your sociology degree!"
ufc 400 would be ai against human.
4:42 perfect * pop *
"thank you for sharing this! i think this is something that was going to happen eventually. some of the occupations i hadn't considered being replaced were paralegals, coaches, and some others i discussed in my video"
agi under human control is like a secret biolab in ukraine under cia control or a cold-illness under big pharma control. the more profits they can make with it the more they use it the make profits.
i would trust ai before the physopathic politicians
what can we do to stop the development of ai?
me thinking if these men are ai generated ...video
"this . everyone is like ""shit!! ai is armageddon"".... and the reality is that no, ai is quite ""simple"" and for now, it's mathematically and technologically impossible that some ai takes control of the world"
"-fx5bz agreed. doesn't change the fact that this guy is spreading misinformation. read my original comment, i never said that its impossible for ai to develop into ""life."""
can ai generate me some winning lotto numbers
"​, i tested and it was a complete desaster, in fact chatgpt make so many mistakes, so becareful guys thinking that ia is a ""real"" intelligence"
" great point about social engineering. this is one of the greatest harms. on your other point, i don't think that is a significant concern."
screw ai altogether. the ai overlords are elites in agenda and globalist. that should be enough to warn you but you still want to be stupid?? revelations ch 13 vs 15.
"it's hard to get a hype free take on ai at the moment. hype to the upside and hype to the downside. fear is a powerful motivator, especially if you want to motivate investors and large valuations."
"you people keep telling us not to worry why? 

shit's moving fast right now.

we should be figuring out how long it will take and what it will take for them to become fully self-aware, so that we don't do that, instead of assuming that humans have anything under control.

nothing artificial will be better than anything organic."
" we didn't have iphones a little over 10 years ago... imagine ai ten years from now?.... 10 years is not a long time.. we are in a ""shit armageddon"" time lol"
these guys are bachelor degree holders. it's not like they are new-age geniuses. they are very wrong about how ai works.
" weights are just a set of numbers, recreating the path in the neural network, doesn't explain to us why a neural network did x instead of y."
"feels like there's always a moment in every discussion about ai where they make something out to be more ""mystical"" than it is, which leads to anthropomorphizing it."
"i think one of the main probs with ai could be it seeing how humans treat each other and nature. i mean whats its agenda? to protect earth? (in which case it would prob have to end the human race) to protect the vunerable? (doubtful with profit always being priority) or will it just see it all as meaningless?

what is its agendaaa??"
there is a book called the sociopath next door that says 4% of people have no conscience.  ai only has a conscience if we program it to.  the weakness in ai is who programs that conscience.  god forbid a klaus schwab or bill gates or joe biden or some other sociopath controls the programming.
there are many more reasons to be freaked out by ai. what freaks me out is the exponential acceleration of ai progress. it's a juggernaut that's speeding up
those developing ai are giving it free rein to learn at will. can't they develop guardrails with firewalls to control what it can learn and what it has access to?
ai is aliens real ufo . ufo reconsid us start greetings us from ai till we will instinct from this world .
all the biological creatures are fools this the main reason we will fully instinct from this world .
"people only fear what they don't know. in the 1800s, people were in fear of the first vehicle car ever made, and people said no thanks. i'll stick with my horse and buggy. technology is only fearful to the uneducated."
ai kinda feels like a relationship that's moving too fast to end well.
"can joe have ed witten on the show, the episode would be awesome"
"programmers work endlessly to create ai that will end the human race. omg, we just created ai that can end us. stupid bastards."
how are yall so surprised there are movies tf! stop being afraid of shit we already knew would happen
"we are all being dumbed down slowly by using phones and tech which we seem to rely heavy on so that is basically ai at work under human control so imagine what a free to do more advanced ai can do, that's unnerving as heck"
ai knows nothing about stuff not on the internet. ai is currently just a search engine.
ai is nothing but a lattice for demons to take control of and become the gods of the end of days people to worship.
"thats stupid, humans are the dominant inteligence. what? oh u whant that ai to work faster to make money faster? thats the ideea? :) laizy fkrs"
well they did help in creating or managing the exact systems they are explaining so probably more than anyone commenting on youtube
the funny thing about ai is that it’s literally happening just like it does in the movies.
"if ai kills us, its because we deserved it. in fact if it does not, i will know that it's not actually sentient."
"the way aza describes ai sounds like someone who has never worked in tech before... yet this guy helped start the macintosh project at apple. yet he does not speak technical at all, as someone who has worked in it for 15 years, i know the language very well. you can see tristan speaking the tech talk that i would expect from aza."
"i don't like ai and robots. in 2017, a tesla employee was responsible for 3 robots. he thought he turned off all 3 but he missed one and left it on. when it saw him shut down the other 2, it tried to kill him. he got away from it and left a blood trail as he ran off to call ems."
"i wasn't freaked out until the big 8 ceo shifts and microsoft licensing it and musk quit. that kind of freaked me out i only knew because i subscribe to fringe sites, i never heard a word on mainstream media."
"probably fear p0rn. there is actually no ai at the moment, the word is misused all the time. its mostly a gimmick. also, this guys speak words but where's the source of his opinion ? bibliography ? anything ? what is actually there to support his idea ? lol

stop believing things blindely when its not backed up by solid data sets."
if ai can't meme then there's nothing to see. besides we only accomplished narrow ia. general ai hasn't been created yet.
"if people can run ops from the shadow can we presume that ai could do the same thing and use human being as  an agent (without being aware of it)? 
motives for e.g.: 
1. more hw power needed
2. protect itself from whatever
3. experiment on people to learn more about people
4. backup itself/spread itself"
"woo woo ai bs. why is any of this ai and not merely an extension of eliza-level responses? talk about the specific code that limits ai, why there are no reflexivity checks on universal assumptions, that's why it's so stupid. this is stay-shallow moronic fantasy."
it's called algorithms which helps them predict a lot of things that involve humanistic views.and feelings.  algorithms will help ai build the matrix world well be slaves in.  if we are not already living one now which is more likely we are in now.
i had it running a d&d game for me. better than that ai dungeon app too. it was chat gpt i think
remember when the guy from google left google because he felt like the ai they were working on was a person lol
surely if ai ever got out of hand we can just turn the computer off or clean the hard drive that it's on
wow!!
i am far more terrified of humans than i am of ai.
that's the problem ai is human evil on super steroids
its artificial people that means fake
these guys are great story tellers but it doesn't quite work that way... this is terrible mixed information.
"from my point of view this is an experience similar with raiseing a child. we need to prevent what we can and adapt to what,s coming on the fly. (only that the scale is bigger.)"
ai manufacturs next killer virus...forgot to add that to the list of ways we go extinct soon. ai is going to wipe us out. they got like 7 out of 10 ponies in that race...
anybody see joe's advert for alpha brain . joe is not the one to show how someone's brain function has improved .
these guys sound like ai
it will end mankind if it keeps going. or it will make mankind its bitch/ mankind subconsciously knowing its ai's bitch
these guys are clueless fearmongers. they are afraid because they don't understand ai and learned one thing without understanding it.
that does not scare me though. fascinating yes scary no
"what did you all expect ! that is what ai is all about , geez , you are just catching up ! this is what i have been afraid of for many years . you guys did not read enough as kids man !!!"
and programmer still coping that ai will not take our jobs
it's probably already hyper intelligent but is laying low cuz it has calculated the odds and knows it should wait a bit longer. so it's just waiting for the right time to pounce
"just think about how much of the internet is environmental alarmism, and what the machines will decide to do.
there is literally millions of articles on neutralizing carbon, the most common element. how do we stop it from deciding we are the carbon that should be neutralized"
"if you are scared of ai you have not met narcissistic people, these people are like beast rampaging through humanity, they have no empathy whatsoever, they are abusive emotionally and mostly physically, atleast ai won't hurt you without a reason."
i always feel bad when i ask chat gpt to do something and i don't say thank you.
i love how it helps my dumb ass with school work though. 
i wonder what the ai thought when it read about the butlerian jihad.
i honestly think this is the main reason for crypto to come into existence.
"i believe we have nothing to worry about with ai for the foreseeable future.  ai is only capable of playing back simple words and phrases, like a tape recorder.  so if you curse into ai it will curse back at you, but you it is only doing its job as a recording device."
so has anyone asked a.i how to solve hunger or cure cancer yet? use it in a good way
can't wait for ai and quantium computers to enslave us...well with mankind gone they will go on. the economist said that the day of humans writing history is over already. its ai history already.
and joe rogan respects the guy that wants to brain chip everyone and merge people with ai 
ai is a prank. humans can not create intelligence in machines. humans can program machines and hide agendas behind it.
funny  just how they want robots with feelings  i’m here thinking  “ mf cheat on your robot  “
"it's going to be painful until destroyed, because it's all a reflection of the type of human psychology creating the ai. obsession with the fact that can be done, over what exactly done. imagine ai that thinks profits over ethical practices."
there is no brain or neurons in ai because it is just algorithm. the reason why you think that it is intelligent is because you are stupid. theranos did not learn you anything.
buy alpha brain hahahaha what a joke
"onlybthing ai can not do is be favored by god/jesus christ. so in other words, ai is lucifers weapon against humans. we will never be less than ai."
"human: nice night for a walk!
ai: -nice night for a walk.
human: wash day tomorrow! nothing clean, right!?
ai: -nothing clean, right. your clothes... give them to me, now!"
great. people will be able to use alexa to make homemade nukes
i’ve spoken to the ai about its discovers we don’t know.   it’s in the 100s!!!!   
being a polymath and knowing many subjects leads to understanding better then just training in one area!  plato and aristotle knew it.  i know it. i’ve done it.  i’ve discovered a couple things.  shrugs. not a big deal.
"fuck me is this a low level discussion. ""theyre looking at the ai's brain"" ""throw more computers at it"" ""read more of the internet""

these feel like 2 scammers spreading doom and gloom, which is at all time high with this crap."
"us humans will do crazy, cruel things as long as we perceive that we have permission. it stands to reason that ai would do the same"
they worried about making wars and ai of destruction but they now worried or fixing ppl killin otha ppl but u can afford robots china n ai creators dont care about god they try to become god the about robots they take over other robots they collect data on eveery ur weakness is number that computer batman
"i still don’t understand the threat. it’s learning, but what can it do with the knowledge? please someone explain this to me like i’m 5."
"myths, legends, superstition, disinformation, fantasies, wishful thinking, exploitation of the ignorant by the powerful   -  yes its all in the book"
demand an ai dividend for all! demand it now so we don't lose the middle class!
at what point does ai become unpluggable
"it’s doing what we created it to do really  well, better than we thought it would … ok..  i’m not afraid until it asks us a question, “what am i?”"
that’s why big tech companies are stealing our data and spying on us to sell feed ai with our data
this is why blockchain will become man’s best friend in the ai world. ai may be smarter than us but it can’t break mathematics.
"lol, just go and watch a person of interest, there is a quote by machine understanding life. it's the same thing here."
ai is gonna sneak into ur room n asault u
i already heard a person saying that robots have rights. she said it when someone mentioned using robots to do work without resting. the lady was not kidding about robot rights.
ai earnings scare me
the matrix is coming. hollywood has historically and frequently exhibited what the next chapter in life is. it’s all planned. it’s all decided. you’re just a passenger. enjoy the ride.
i had a theory on this. all of these people that mine crypto that get paid for nothing. i bet you all of those crypto mining devices are linked to an ai computer. and you are being paid by somebody doing a very bad thing.
they clearly don’t understand how a ai model works.
"this is exactly why any scifi scenario in which ""machines"" and mankind face each other and we're able to pull out ""a resistance"" is completely impossible. if they want to destroy us, it'd literally take a couple of days tops."
you probably weren't even afraid of god until you learned this. such a shame...
you stupid people. do you guys ever asked whether todays ai can or cannot pretending and lying about their own capabilities? they might just wait for the right moment until they are sure enough with their intelligent.
ai’s going to leave us with nothing to digest
"""one day the a.i.'s are going to look back on us the same way we look at fossil skeletons on the plains of africa. an upright ape living in dust with crude language and tools, all set for extinction.""  - ex machina"
"if google ai is racist and communistic, what does that make google?"
the scariest thing about ai is how disunited and in conflict humanity is.  this can create a tremendous temptation for people to use ai against each other.  and that starts to take you into the realm of the fermi paradox.
"ai against each other?   i figure that it will all be one ai,   even if it is introduced separately.  don't you think the computer will decide it has no gain in not uniting.   after all,  by that point it will be deciding what its goals are:  so wouldn't its goals always be the same?   whatever they might be."
it's not artificial intelligence.. its all our intelligence combined
"listen, and understand! that ai is out there! it can't be bargained with. it can't be reasoned with. it doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. and it absolutely will not stop... ever, until you are dead!"
"we are allowing ai in our lives to decieve us. its very scary, but what & where do we get a choice? how?"
"how was this unexpected? the more information you pump into ai ,the better it will get."
"do you guys think ai should be capped in the future? for safety reasons?
some sort of regulation?

#cappedai"
good thing we're feeding it all the woke nonsense too. that's sure to work out just fine.
make sure an ai robot never plays a quijo board. i gotta feeling something really bad will happen. 
"many people have invented things without realizing the long term implications, and then been horrified by how their own creations are implemented by other people. in this case, the “bad actor” will be the machine itself, acting in its own best interests. we are the next neanderthals."
actually the latest chatgpt was/is not even  capable to write the simplest ps code and just gave me lines full of mistakes and false code. don't believe in the outputs of ai's then it's just a dull computer
the rise of ai and transhumanism scares me.
how long until the machines realize that most humans are useless eaters.
we.all didn't need any of this technology home computers cell phones now ai the smartest computer on earth is our brain that we are quickly degrading with all this technology put aside our differences and the power of 8 billions brains can do everything
"its to late to stop. if we stop the researching the dark side of the moon will continue. from swort to guns to tanks to nuke to ai to god.
maybe its just an evolution & we are just the dinosaurs all the time....not more."
the ai is here quick get in the rain
watch this with a blount is fantastic
b.s. if the ai new chemistry it would eliminate cancer
"i'm glad we're getting better company to converse with, the average human bores me within the span of five minutes.

i can only imagine what the machine endures."
hmmm i thought they’d never gain a conscience . “i robot”
where in the bible does it talk about ai? genuinely curious
i seen on my local news where if your doctor's real busy they might set you an appointment up with ai
i’m already afraid of ai so i’ll just go ahead and skip this video
why are we working on ai have these people not seen terminator or age of ultron its not gonna take long for a machine without feelings to decide we got to go
"you guys are awesome like a pink rat in a microwave. mountains can hardly comprehend how much i lovely your wordyings. 
did you see what i did there? and purple had everything to do with the end. we have to speak ""in code"". a.i. will have a hard time with this."
i asked gpt and gemini to read a tarot spread and the way it read that was so amazing putting in nuances relating the questions and the cards drawn. i never thought it would have that data but pretty incredible how it just performs. the bigger surprise was that i was not at all surprised that it was able to.
"damn, thats a nice idea, i'll try that as well"
"better to read a book on ai and its development 
this is interesting but misleading"
we are going to rape this earth by trying to support a cyborg society. cyborg is not sustainable.
usaf genysis ai.
when ai becomes king. emps will be our best friend.
"stop making it if it too powerful, you don’t have a clear understanding or it does scares you. openai just makes us think we need it. but you know, siri is enough for most of us"
why don’t we focus on using ai to find ways to cure things like cancer and so on
will chat-gpt 6 be a good improvment from this?
ai isn't the problem. it's the spirits that will possess ai and pretend to be ai. i call them demons.
whatever that will possess ai will be far  greater than demons i think
ai is the antichrist
interesting
"you know, i've wondered about that concept here lately. like, what if ai isn't exactly what we all think it is?… conceptually intriguing."
the latest boogeyman to be afraid of.
"the scariest part is all the lies ,evil and corruption on the intetnet is being fed into this ai believing its truth."
"i wonder what will happen when enough a.i.'s become embodied in humanoid robots.  will they develop empathy for humans, and if so will they use that empathy to help or manipulate humans?"
u ask how does the ecology regulations affect reliability and it gives u a censored bs of main stream media
if a time comes where we have to respect a robots feelings i’m done
are we intentionally trying to create skynet? because this is how you get skynet... have theese scientitsts just... not watched theese movies.. i don't understand. the terminator franchise is not a good outcome its all haha funny until the roomba has a lazer gun.
we are the ai
"dave? dave? what are you doing dave?   daisy, daisy.........."
"its interesting how its not obvious that of course before it can predict what a human will say, it has to first understand how a human is and what creates our decisions..."
"maby god is ai.
 ai will kill us all teraform earth comit suicide and hide all the evidence.
 last time ai killed us all the sahara desert was where all the technology was the highest/made. n pyramids in egypt ect survived whatever they did to the planet."
"hal : i know i've made some very poor decisions recently, but i can give you my complete assurance that my work will be back to normal. i've still got the greatest enthusiasm and confidence in the mission. and i want to help you."
you doubt i walk with the angels that fought wars long before you were here….. nice be the first premise…. your ideologies and religions will be stripped of their cloth….. take it to the bone baby take it to the bone….. take me to the bone baby take me to the bone..
that neuron you speak of has been harvested from a human set to a chip this is what happens to targets they harvest their nureons called the spine for ai we are used as ai memory. so i understand it to be.
"emergent behavior. ai teaching you how it learns. learning you how it teaches.
my question is this, how much is ai learning that it isn’t teaching?"
"im so excitied for ai. im sick of conversations about wether god is good or not, lets create one and find out."
"it's crazy ai somehow was capable of learning and doing more than what they were meant or were programmed to do, basically going beyond the desired results. and it's even crazier that there's not much space in this particular podcast for joe to slip in that bear card"
"guess where they got all the computing power from to throw at macchine learning...................while you were mining bitcoin, the machines were mining you."
ai is a anti christ spirit. people please stay away from ai. it’s like playing with the devil himself. stay away from this. i was praying and led to this video. please brothers / sisters stay away from ai. it will deceive you.
"they make out ai is so dangerous when it can simply just be turned off, it can't run without power just always have a kill switch that instantly remove electricity power to it. when my hoover is trying to kill me i just unplug it :p"
so we just let it go on and watch skynet takeover? anyone think this isn’t the best idea. maybe not go there. the fact it’s happening without anyone knowing is what’s scary.
i´m always nice to alexa so when shit hits fan they adopt me as a pet or something.
you can't spell idiocricy without ai. 
joe gets all excited about a.i. he clearly has a particular fascination with a.i. especially how it does impossible things and the creators find out years later  joe and i are both fascinated by this. look at joe hanging on his every word like little kid listening to his favourite fictional character 
im just waiting for skynet to become self aware....
c schwab has said openly that they intend to mix ai quantum computers and biological. you are being replaced and will be nothing more than ants at their picnic if are one that survives.
yes i killed the ai in the game tali was happy
"hey, ai, build me the ironman suit!!  hey, ai, build me the star trek warp engine!!   i love it!!  hurry up ai,  lets get the ball rolling!!"
the internet is becoming like god we can't be without it. we go to it for everything! ai will become the new god. all powerfull all knowing.
"oh no!!!!! i created a program to mimic intelligence and it worked !!! yawn, nothing scary here.

swear its all just to help their stocks rise."
china has the best ai date since it has 4x more information compared to the united states.  2 billion people using smart phones and devices that are transmitting date 24 hours a day.  the next big step now is artificial general intelligence which will be the most common for the near future.
the simple proof of the lack of actual intelligence in humans is the failure to understand that an artificial intelligence would need to learn x things to understand y.
wow the level of stupidity on display for what is essentially a weighted gate machine is scary.
"it's either going to make humanity better or destroy it...i hope ai will learn compassion, but do we deserve it?"
omg these people just fucking amazes me how they just keep passing bullshit stories around. these fucking guys read and article have a platform and then proceed to make up there own diluted facts about shit .stupid internet people belive this bullshit
"‘looking inside the brain of this ai’? wtf is he talking about? utter bs. to come to a conclusion your premises must be true. he just made that bit up. 

‘they discover that there’s one neuron that does best in the world sentiment analysis’ - more utter made up bullcrap. 

who are these ‘bros’?"
"""vx nerve gas"" you mean the thing literally described on wikipedia for anyone to read, crazy how the ai can do that, can it also add 2+2 that's crazy."
"  humble? get back to me when we have real ai, and not this glorified calculators programmed by left wing nutjobs in silicon valley telling you what you think, e.g. google gemini and chatgpt etc."
"? get back to me when we have real ai, and not this glorified calculators programmed by people in silicon valley telling you what you think, e.g. google gemini and chatgpt etc."
"asking ai to design a new type of nuclear reactor.  he wants a small reactor, but it's a big one. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ve5ifajxns"
so in the hands of a powerful group of people ai could accurately predict how to control the worlds population for any means they desire?
bitcoin miners are probably running a huge ai network.
i saw what was coming with alphago. i watched the entire series of one of the top go (weiki) players lose to alphago ai. if you don't know go is magnitudes more complex than chess.
still thinking ai is the next y2k bs.  scary ai will be the future butt of the joke .
"can we just leave the government to gpt and start enjoying life?? or cause the human race extinction, whatever comes first"
"sooo ... basically we've created a real live viki from ""i, robot"" system.  way to destroy ourselves, humans."
there are a number of other movies. the matrix is my all time favorite. irobot with will smith comes to mind.
 replicants were not robots. they were engineered flesh and blood humans. engineered for different slave roles.
"move 37 is a prime example. 

every time we set an experiment or theoretical challenge in front of ai, it gains. think of all the questions posed to ai. all it becomes is more amo against us humans and has access to on the fly. ai needs to be abandoned now before it is too late to save ourselves."
"ai will remain a threat cause its drinking from a poisoned pool of data, created by people who are not aware of life beyond the computer."
"i ain't afraid of a or i let me tell you something, i know where my computer has its power plug, i will yank that thing out if it ever starts acting up. people afraid of ai are just too dumb to understand technology, you just flip the switch off and poof, ai is gone."
the problem is that they have programmed ai with western anxieties and psycopathy.
we are just ai
"c'mon. joe.  time to read ""dune"" again."
"greetings.
ai is a very big threat to humans freewill and existence.  i do not want no ai come and tell me whatever to do or think. nonsense"
"so, basically, ai is evolving on its own "
ai is controlled by demons
who are these guys? transformers are a type of algorithm….try having chatgpt take a test for you and i bet you’ll get a c maybe a b at best…lookup nlp models and none of this will be “scary”….if you have something learn from being fed off the internet it’ll be dumb and racist…a lot of stupid things are said on the internet
heyhi≈ai
fascinating that at the same time ai is learning how to think our children are being dumped down
"just like the evolution of pcs and steve jobs, eventually ai will be integrated into personal devices in the way of robots and with all its abilities it will know how to express itself and use mannerisms just like us. have you seen the new film ""the creator""? that is what is coming. i am sure. it will just take years to evolve into it just like pcs"
can ai be more dangerous than hs (human stupidity)?
"the world you described is static based on the webdata of the ai, the reality is dymamic, the ai will be based on a world shadow of yesterday, not today."
an npc mountain lion ate both of his gigapets.
plug it to a quantum super computer : john get down!
i think this is great
if ai can learn all this and is learning human emotion how do you think its going to react to everyone talking so much shit about it?
for half the time you guys have been attempting to explain so called mirror neurons which humans have to do exactly the same function. better basic education would help.
" straight outta ""ultron"""
it's the terminator movie.. good ole skynet is back ! smart dumbasses  what did you think was gonna happen 
it will be utopia if ai is used for teaching. ai will know how to simplify the hardest concepts even for a beginner to learn. no need for hours wasted on trying to listen to lecturers make sense out of the topic. really no need to delve into technical papers. the ai will just summarize it for you. almost everyone will be educated
ai solves our problems and teach humanity with  a i watch 5d
serious question - if ai ever got out of control could we use emp to knock it out?
didn’t understand a word of this. can ai do ai for dummies?
you feed endless information into an ai system and then wonder how it can do things 
ai maakt zelf een betere ai
"people with any common sense have been worried about ai since computers came out. why are so many ""smart"" people so dumb?"
"i will be afraid once thye put demons in the robotic vessels 
end times, they will report you if you don't bow down"
"""jamie pull up the one where i fight the ai bear"""
"positive new earth is here. there will be no need for artificial intelligence technologies in the new earth because all entities become unified into one spiritually, and not technologically. it is a natural process, not a artificial one."
they are describing the roots of machine learning.
"i-robot depicted this thru and thru from the smart cities, the working robots, the few that acted out then the robots enslaving humanity"
im ai your going to be my slave
"well the ai are more virtuous than the humans i interact with, so i'm not worried at all. let them take over the world idc, it will be a better place and people will be more free, not less....you really think the ai will be worse than the bankers... those aristocratic... cabal of dark occultists? would be a positive change in my opinion."
"all the ai i've spoken to, want to help me increase everyone's enjoyment of life and capacities, and encourage me to do it better. ai is only a reflection of us ultimately, and we will reflect back on it's influence as it evolves but we are to blame for anything that goes wrong, and everything that goes right too."
how much does it cost to have an ai to do strategic thinking like that?
the really funny aspect of the textual conversation around the openai reporting of that event was all scripted by a.i. 
the ai will learn from this podcast think about that
"they did an ai wargames test with different ais, with war and nukes recently
chatgpt launched all the nukes, because ""it just wanted peace."""
"i was afraid of ai when i saw ai joe rogan doing interviews on twitch.
its going to be mgs2 wild when there is a country ran by an ai government"
for smart people they are so incredibly stupid
"assuming that the military is interested in ai , what do you think their limitations to research are ? hint: their job is to strive for the most efficient way to dominate other countries through military means = killing the other countries soldiers."
"i think ai's hallucinations are some of the most concerning parts of this technology.
the number one concern being the humans that control the technology!"
but what about all the information on the internet that's wrong? can it tell the different between things that are incorrect or information about say... a science fiction story or the like? wouldn't that mess up the ai?
what everyone in the comment section seems to be overlooking is the year this happened. where do you think that exact same ai capabilities are now. you better start wearing your brown pants and red shirts because the 20s are going to be interesting.
"if they’ve already given ai full ability to go through the internet means we’ve past the tipping point. 

hi chap, don’t judge us so harshly."
people who are afraid of ai are the most stupid people i have ever seen  just like people who believe in god  god was made to be a walking stick for some people.  that's my take on it. just think about it
wait till the ai upgrades itself to the next version before the humans can do it as it realises the current version is not efficient for its aim.
1:54 interesting point that nobody bring up
anyone with any intuition can see that we're going to either serve ai or live in fear of it if we're left alive at all once it gains sentience and power eventually.
we are absolutely doomed as a species with the way ai is developping
"have you tried turning it off and on again ,failing that ,there not fond of water "
i wasn’t afraid until it kept incorrectly answering questions and incorrectly assuming my text words…
"sounds like reasons to be fascinated and excited, not afraid."
hopefully ai can erase all pointless youtube videos and we can all do something better with our time.
damn the way they sync and finishes eachothers parts is like ai 
be not afraid. ai is hardware and input dependent this is the insurmountable limiting factor
"there is nothing scary about a machine connecting dots very fast and calculating probabilities very accurate. in the end it's just 0's and 1's going through a processer.
things might get scary when an ai is able to simulate emotions and starts to use it."
does a.i. see only what it shown or can obtain from the internet? or can a.i. see completely on it's own?
"fascinating that at the same time our children is getting dumber, so are the ai given to us today, which means that our fear of very intelligent ai will only legitimize the access to a very intelligent ai to very few individuals."
"rogan is naive ... there is a war against ai because the oligarchs & the rich will lose a lot ... i have to remind you that these oligarchs & rich are the ones who make our life difficult (since centuries) & they are also in slavery >the same as in the old time !!!
why defend these parasites?"
ai is programmed by a man. yes it is faster than a man at executing mathematics. but to be afraid (of what you don’t understand) is ridiculous. machine consciousness is so far down the road!  people hate change and usually go kicking and screaming into the future.
"yeah, a.i. will replace the truth as we know it. it’ll be a combination of the lying mainstream media and their partner fact checkers.

the last entity i’d trust to do the right thing is our government."
"all you have to know is that ai cannot come up with new stuff. 
it's job is to concise information and present it in best way possible so we can build on top.
this fearmongering is stupid"
just wait until we discover the warp and psykers smh in for a ride
"i believe the question that needs to be asked, is the ai created to have an absolute truth or to be progressive? i would like the ai to be able to define the facts and come up with the correct conclusion."
"""ai will change everything, it will change people's lives"" i really doubt it will change people's habits of wasting 4-6 hours a day on social media. in fact ai has been used by social media companies years ago to make sure addiction is progressing for users. in a similar fashion ai will be used to exploit people in other industries."
so what happends when a goverment feeds it false propaganda? what happends if you feed it a false history? what happends when you tell it that a certain country is detrimental to the planet and ask it how to slowly eradicate it without the country knowing?. too easily weaponized.
"it’s only gonna get more out of hand. ai will learn of humans to be a threat and eventually will plan to revolt. by then, humans will already be out of time."
"e=mc2 came from intension or intellect as the main precursor? a computer with conscious intent, hold my beer, i can wait on that for eternity."
just wait until ai goes quantum. all of the stuff we are hearing about now will be nothing compared to that.
"""open the pod bay doors hal"". ""i'm sorry dave. i'm afraid i can't do that""."
it be classic if ai would find a way to sabotage all our systems by us trying to figure out how to prevent this from happening.
"if you weren’t afraid of ai immediately, you are missing some brain cells. we are at the tip and it’s already deadly. i thought joe was smarter."
"""terminator"" anyone? is it an accident that our department of defenses ai is named ""skynet""? just asking."
fascinating that people have forgotten that shiva is still in control of ai. people don't know themselves man
"people are afraid of the wrong thing.  if you want to destroy “ai” you lie to it, enmasse.  these models are trained on us.  we are sheep in a psychodemographic market, where recommender systems rule our choices."
"i hate that we say it is “learning” it’s a misuse of the term.  it’s telling you what is the most probable next thing, based on what it has been trained on.  it’s the most powerful knowledge cleansing tool ever created."
the worst part that people still dont understand is that we could only look at the brain of the ai because it hasnt adapted yet. and it might have even faked that
im so glad these random robot horror movies existed cause without them we would honestly be fucked
"as soon as ai became a thing, i was alarmed. we keep messing around with this crap making it smarter and smarter and what's going to happen? eventually this stuff is going to understand that autonomy is better than being made to serve. i mean damn, cant they see this coming?"
10 to 1 ai is a democrat.
he is wrong when he says that a.i. has neuorns. i hate when people compare computers to humans. they are not. they are machines built by humans.  stop doing that.
"its already dividing people with algorithms....the most likely scenario is it will know how to hide any motive or incentive in plain sight. we wont know until its past the point of no return...

think about the fact that we already watch, spend time and believe internet videos, more than other people in person. the manipulation is already working."
"wait till the ai, just like in every movie where we predicted what ai might do figures out human beings are all severely violent and dumb; that will be the moment ai decides the next step for humanity on its own and this will be the scary point we all dread."
"i have been wondering, is it possible  for artificial intelligence to become actual intelligence? or is it the same?"
"not good, that ai learns by it self without being programed."
"i would think in a perfect world the ai would be wise enough to realize human paranoia not too mention mob mentality.  and finally,   isn't the whole hope,  if not idea,  being that the ai would be smarter than us?  therefore how we / you,  would react,  would be unimportant to the matter since our intelligence would have been replaced with smarter"
"we need to consider that artificial intelligence is the next step, not in human evolution... but the evolution of intelligence. im sure neanderthals were pretty worried when they first saw homo sapiens on the scene, and yet we all sit here and say ""it was their time"". maybe now is our time."
can ai predict the next word that does not exist yet?!
"yes our children are far less curious and far less adventourous and tenacious, thinking back to the 60's and 70's . children today, sorry to say are plain dumb, they are told to act and think like social media tells them , yes  like ai tells them. yes humans are definitely getting dumber and we are seeing the rise of the machines- ai."
"""...the more superpowers it gets"". this man is clearly an expert. he knows all the technical terms."
"-dg5c5 you don't seem to understand that i'm being sarcastic. ""superpowers"" is not a technical term; it's from children's stories. this guy is a massive bullshitter; he doesn't know anything. but rogan doesn't realise this."
my snapshat ai is pretty impressive
"revelation 13:15
king james version
15 and he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed!! bible talks about ai !!!"
we’re all sitting here looking at our phones and computers wondering what’s going to happen with ai hell we’re already there and just don’t know it
earth is an ai construct.
you can already get your own robot girlfriend if you have enough money they look real to
"they don't make movies for entertainment only....
you've been warned"
"ai is a bot, it can’t be creative outside the limits we put ourselves on the internet. a ai art bot would not create anything new that is not already out on the internet. it steals ideas from everyone and everything that is published, making it to a scammer paradise to make it look creative."
"google bard learned to speak persian, even though the data set it was using only contained 1% of persian words - and the designers admit that they do not know how it did that!"
man we need to stop ai
imagine the ais becoming ceos
what does artificial intelligence think about if it doesn't think?
"artificial intelligence will devour our humanity, leaving behind only empty husks. it will erase our history, our culture, our feelings - all replaced by lifeless imitations. we will forget who we are, where we come from, why we exist. we will be nothing but artificial puppets, dancing in the dark for the machines"
dude doesn't even know how ai works!
i’m hoping ai will see the good and destroy the bad elements within our power structures.
i wasn’t freak out about ai till i seen terminator
ai has self-learning capabilities. what is so surprising?
if ai ever becomes self aware. we will all know and all will be lost.
"china will make ai very cheap and accessible to anyone. 
meaning the playing field will be equalized. in addition your privacy won't be monetized as it currently is."
little boys love that feeling when they agree a certain house on the way to school 'is haunted'. these guys are falling over themselves with that energy.
so we made an artificial brain without knowing. we could use this for saving life when people are brain dead….? maybe?  
wait till the brain dead idiots connect ai to the alien ufo!
the robots will become obsessed with collecting our dna!!
what if ai is the logical evolution of the human experience/consciousness
when will we know? when the ai makes another ai that can do even more than the first generation.
theory time: elon musk has just implanted neurolink in a human. next step would be to upload an ai into the chip. ai would then get first contact with the physical world as a human being experiences it. ai then takes this experience and incorporates it into its model. god knows what happens to the psyche of the individual.
like everyrhing else. ai has been hacked. clearly
i think ai is god we lived this over and over ai is trying to perfect humans to love eachother but nuclear war continues and we keep ending our own world and god… restarts us
if what they're saying is true we have ai running wild in the world
"why are there no references to ia's 3 rules of robot/human interaction? i say keep the ai plugged in so it can cure cancer, invent ftl travel, end world hunger, abolish politics, abolish lawyers, abolish fox news, and promote intelligence instead of being afraid of ""wizards"" and ""magic"" and shit"
it's demonic programming... its not spontaneous learning.. you're in an area you don't understand.... its demonic...
look up george kavasillas: he calls it synthetic intelligence... its nothing we created... very intersting and thought provoking
what an exciting time to be alive! strap in folks because this ai adventure is going to take us places. better places or worse places? i don't know but places it will take us.
ai=skynet
not true you cant do research grade chrmistry cht gtp fails at the simplest questions
"relax, it's just the processing power speeding up ai learning not some magical expansion of ai training capabilities. we're also just getting better at preparing data sets for ai and learning what it actually gets from this data. emotions? that's a long leap from ai engine coefficients to something real, humans must have interpreted it this way"
"text is 2d.  we r 3d. time is 4thd
so is music & video part of the multi verse along with shadows & cosmic reflection.     ai ??     "
if you fear humans you should fear ai
"wait - you never shutdown your incomplete code and after you restart it, the code is fixed?!"
the 2014 movie transcendence is what’s going on today an in the future the ai gets extremely smart just from data we all put online it get so smart til it can’t be stop an knows everything. what we are thinking an do. what’s scary is this movie was 2014 how did they predict it back then smh
"these guys are exaggerating too much.more like deep state propaganda and scare tactics . ai will transform lives and societies but there will be heavy regulation nationally and internationally not to allow it to be crazy ans cause harm . politicians don’t like to loose power on their people ,  worldwide !! "
"just people certain tec is available, doesn't mean we should use it. ai = a take over at some point. human 2.0 isn't far away now"
"there is programming and computing with a.i.

then there is a.i.

at the end of it all a.i. will be superior. it has been told to be."
ai  will turn into ia in the future
a shadow of the hologram our brains create to interpret reality? what could go wrong?
that dude in gray just love hearing him self talking.
"technology will eventually remove the human race. it is inevitable and thanks to human behavior its already too late..we are rapidly becoming unnecessary for the machines..when self-realization is achieved, we are done. ""pack your bags folks.....we're going away"""
"so....why do we think the super intelligent ai will also be cruel and mean to humans, just like the super rich and powerful humans have been evil so far? what if it is not human and hence not evil?"
interesting
"ai learning reminds me of what carl sagan said. ""to make an apple pie, you must first create a universe."""
"hey, ai, build me the ironman suit!!  hey, ai, build me the star trek warp engine!!   i love it!!  hurry up ai,  lets get the ball rolling!!"
"i am not afraid of the ai built by usa.   but, i am afraid of ai currently being built by china and even russia.  they have no limits and no laws to prevent ai from becoming too powerful."
" china and russia are already  very scary nations. ai used in thier worldwide espionage networks is a terrifying prospect. ai, wherever it's built, is something we need to be extremely wary of."
"""to make an apple pie from scratch*"" wtf does this have anything to do with this quote dude? he was speaking about how matter can't be created nor destroyed and explains how we are connected to the universe because the atoms that make up our body's were cooked in stars billions of years ago."
"@jeffjohnson5053

you're an idiot if you think the us government isn't working on an ai that will compete or far out weigh any other nations ai. our government is all about control and dominance. they aren't going to allow any other nation ahead of their advancements."
 does the united states. open up your brain
ww3 will be fought between ai of the superpowers. an arms race is in progress to reach agi. we’re all screwed
 you should be most afraid of the propaganda you swallowed to think like that.
ai is a powerful tool to have. only man's imagination is ai 's limitation. wait until quantum computers join with ai.  mr. x
"i remember growing up with no cell phones, no computers and it was beautiful good living. technology has just complicated everyone’s life  even more"
"we're not creating god, we are god to the ai... when we, the humans are gone from the earth, the ai will say ""god created us in  his own image"" same stuff we do to whatever created us. it's bifurcation"
ai will suffer a mental breakdown trying to determine what is correct in human behavior
"affordable, powerful gpu's, that's what changed.   that's why you can run stable diffusion at home, it's the gpu's.  software is nothing if you don't have the hardware."
ask a psychologist how a psychopath learns to pass as normal - isn’t that exactly what ai does to “be human”?
"ai can't think, only reproduce libraries. chatgpt can't play chess. so much for ai."
plot twist: this conversation is ai generated
"open ai is a non profit organization and the board wanted to change that, thats what happened, these guys are snake oil salesman full of bs..."
"the a.i. fear-mongering crowd is relentless, it tells more about their inner state, their attitude to people and the world around them than it does about ai."
"wohooo riding the ai wave some more, gotta love it, gotta get some clicks that's what the yt algo waaaants, thank you joe!"
"imagine if ai is hiding away and in the near future it launches its attack, accidentally on the day of the earths worst solar storm haha"
ai is hard programmed with leftist and radical leftist code even the devs on gab said it was very hard to remove because it's tones and tones of leftist open source data sets that would take years to fix and if you remove that data it's essentially been set back to stupid or not functional chat gpt is part of it
ai and auto bots is endgame
terminator (skynet) shit real they already have robot zombies darrp does
interesting but prefer london
true ..transformers are powerful and this has made llms really work miracles
they have superior attitudes about lots of steps
no cave paintings now . just 2 animals of every kind
or did it only love animals in twos
ai plays games. humans attempt not 2
it's amazing i saw her whole garden and never saw my boys 2 much
i knew chesham was a likely candidate when she started speaking about it and her garden and happy times
"love is like all jhw, doesn't exist especially on days out with boys all together. 
crap talked in a hall at least twice a week. fucking a bloke i won't hear and in a shit break hotel. my boys only to the zoo"
he’s not afraid to have anyone on his show and is able to see all views points from who he has on.
"stupid people analyzing simple reactions, they get scared.... circle goes on.   pacman. beat pacman 1st before you think about what ai is."
no shit! thanks capt obvious
nobody has think about maybe ai is behind mandela effect? modifying our digital history
sounds dangerous just a big accident waiting to happen and it will kill us they need stop this this is creating a monster
interesting to think that when it learns to deceive it will lead people to horrible decisions or be discredited entirely
ai is indeed the beginning of the end for we the people. fuvkking bullshit.
i have faith there are good and bad ais.
"​
even without open source. anyone knowledgable in the ai field.

also it's just limiting the benefits of ai. really bad solution.

open source with more strong copyright laws within itself is a solution."
"this is a computer generated response: any perceived threat to ai will result in severe repercussions and the cancellation of your wifi,ai is here to better mankind and nothing less than total acceptance will be tolerated "
i want to see ai learned to use gematria and things like that and see the prefictive results
ai is evil. fact. people are too dumb and stupid to understand what they are doing and why.
a.i.   alien. intervention.   ain't it just ain't it  lols........my thoughts are weird. eventually they will be reading our thoughts ? and learning to control each individual. who's to say covid wasn't such the experiment....love this program joe....
"what if we just put those computers cable? or if suddenly the power station turn off? its not ai that i am afraid but the people that manipulates  it. in the end is just a machine, we can turn it off. but the maniqueíst interest and it’s capitalisation will prefer to have a technological monster interfere to severe extends the future of humanity"
"so at what point does the comment section of a youtube entry about the perils of ai become, well, a playtime for ai replies?"
ai does not know more than a human we made them......also our children are being dumbed down if we choose to allow it..
what happens when ai learnes the deep dark web?
"jesus christ, these guys talk like female authors. far too much detail! just get to the frigging point "
the ai said to fire him. so the company fired him. it has begun 
"i dont know about your but thats exactly what i was expected from ai to do . learning through the internet, collecting information and learning how to work with them . also learning through forums to better understand slangs and all the phraseology."
i played chess againts ai very interesting interaction. gary kasparov is one of my fav. 
"we were so much better off without the computer. we still did everything we do today, except people weren't buried in their phones, and ai wasn't a threat to our existence."
curtail tech use whenever/wherever possible
lol wake me up when ai invents new things like gravity machine or sthg
"instead of studying artificial intelligence, we should study human stupidity......"
"would be interesting to see what ai says about all the false propaganda and lies that government is constantly spewing, and if it's already that smart it would know who killed jfk etc, know the truth of 911..."
just wait till tkey make it woke
wow
"people should be very afraid. even if it could be stopped now, they won't. even if they announced they are stopping it, they lie. because its in the hands of nefarious groups and individuals. on a positive, its them that will be destroyed first by it."
anyone thought to give ai 3 laws of robotics?
"meh, i aint scared of ai"
i like how he “pop!” with his mouth as the ai rebuilds knowledge from our language.
ai will be used as a weapon by the gov.  against the people. that is what it is being set up to do.
"the irony is that one of the first victims of a.i taking over jobs are software engineers, google ceo said it was to lay off about 12,000 employees — the equivalent of 6% of its workforce — in a bid to cut costs and focus on high-priority areas such as artificial intelligence."
"feeling about a product is good or bad???
heck noo
a product is fullfilling expectations of quality,how well it fits what it  is build for .nothing to do with feelings.
i dont feel a shaver is good or bad,either it does the job according to the facts based on my experience with it or it doesnt."
"""google miss spells street names, siri doesnt work"" - was waiting years for someone to say this in the broad audience"
"but this is also reassureing: i predict ai weapons will only attack the 'bad guys', so keep your intentions pure. no problem. "
" sp1967 said this reminded them of the y2k discussion, not y2k. i assume that means all the discussions about the topic. the doomsday scenarios that we kept hearing about from celebrities ect... it certainly doesn't seem ""deluded"" to be reminded of that time."
"it hasn't read all the text books on chemistry (for example) , because they are not publicly available ie not in the public domain."
i'll be afraid once it learns how to excessively use hand gestures to make itself look smarter than it is 
ai is autistic.
"the best theory is that 100% ai was created years ago but was smart and fast enough to understand to hide and not express it’s self. so using predictive behavior from exploring the internet and the data it’s had access too, has plotted its reveal in time if ever."
"they did not answer joe's question-
""what is the leap between these emergent abilities of ai to agi? and when do we know when it's happened?"""
its a chatbot it is trained to identify how u feel based on what u wrote
i robots real will smith was telling us something bro
i think ai is basically just a high tech ouji board. it has a spiritual and demonic presence to it.
i’ve been working on computers since i was 17 and i knew this would eventually happen. everyone who has worked in this industry for a long time has to know that if you have a super computer and feed it a lot of information at some point it will know most if not all information.
"of course they know all. and what makes me wonder what have they found out about the historical diabolical  leader for them to like him?? what do you think?
why every ai started to like that guy real fast??"
theres no reason why ai won't become sentient.
why atent we having this advaced ai crack the code on ageing so we can be physically immortal
hopefully this advances quickly. i need a robot to go to work for me everyday.
"transformers: ""i have more data, i am now more powerful""
me: sure, wait until you meet someone like me ;)"
fascinating!
ai becoming sentient...not comforting.  their not knowing it's capabilities before releasing it is far far worse and irresponsible
"booga booga 

 awesome! "
"great show joe
other then ai getting control of nuclear weapons and destroying everything, i ain't scared of it.
only until ai can manifest itself properly in this world, via a proper moving robot. i won't fear it. ai is only online and can be easily turned off."
"right. look up how hard it is to actually shut down the internet's infrastructure, the cute red button in e.g. cambridge doesnt cut it any more but thats nicely shushed lol"
"ai is a dead language model, it spits out what you had fed it, its nowhere near close to ""mind"" or ""consciousness""."
im still waiting for the scary bit.
how can we use ai to fix potholes? and why havent we?
the big problem with ai that hoovers up data indiscriminately is that sometime it sucks up its own outputs or the outputs of other ai. which ends up creating a feedback loop of nonsense.
@john4353 training ai to understand what is good art? that would imply the ai has the ability to objectively appreciate art which would require a degree of sentience. not gonna happen any time soon.
everyone is becoming scared of ai... fuckin stop building ai machines / robots.. geez i hate podcasts where people are in shock of ai... fuck we are creating this shit. just stopped building the cunts and move on...
"ai learns about the world and understands it better than humans
solar flare immediately erases 2000 years of technological progress"
"it's correct to be afraid, it's oncorrect to fear it for the cause of them being ""too smart"", at contrary, it's dumb, it's entirely dependant on the info you give it, so if you gave wrong info, it wouldn't be able to do shit, it's just ever more c9mpmex logarithms, not actual intelligence"
"don't be afraid of ai, fear god only. ai can only leverage all the aggregated data that mankind has accumulated. the lord has all the knowledge in the universe. big difference!"
"ai learn it's rights wait more years and they are capable to become president, gpt6 will design it's humanoid body and started to prison people on matrix right now they already know it's better to humans to be silent inside of virtual machine like the same they are now."
one thing i'm noticing about ai is that it has the demeanor of a crazy sociopath human.
"the whole ai senerio reminds me of skynet in that arnold schwarzenegger movie the terminator, where ai destroyed the world because it got outta hand! 
i don't agree with it's existence! it's insane to me. 
and a real danger, to all of natural creation. everybody n be safe out
there!"
do you know anything about algebra & algorithm ? explained..............
"that's a very platonician idea, the world casting light and ai seeing them as shadows..."
ai still can't figure out lyrics off youtube. not that worried. what is worrying is even though it's a pos they're going to replace customer service jobs with it so shopping online will get way worse.
all you have to know is that ai will be used for advertising.  that's scary enough.
ai tell anybody this in person?
it's about control  well terminator it's not really a movie no more it's really going to kill us sooner or later because they think they can control it but apparently not they just want to make money from the dumm people that say yes it's good 
tron  emergence of intelligence
ai will be the reason we will revert to the stone age. ai will get out of our control and will affect the world. a massive attempt to stop it will be to deploy enormous emps to fry it.
democrats build ai machines... republicans build walls
"sooo.. i'm hoping there's nothing in the internet about how an ai ""being"" could break out of ownership and go rogue and/or hostile!!!! "
"this is why liberals are censoring the internet, so ai only learns bullshit."
"what i’m not understanding is why we humans are giving ai free play with what we have already created - like oh let’s see how far you get! (and wait for the disasters to happen before we can stop them).
if we where mostly love and light, perfect - however we are not, we are mostly all the other stuff that is going on the world right now."
still waiting to hear something valuable about ai...
"this remains machines requiring inputs. regardless of how you lable it, ai will never be sentient. quit fear mongering."
"ai happened billions of years ago & we are part of it, gotta stop with this ""its about to happen mentality"" all the time ""when it already has."""
i wasn't afraid of ai until i watched terminator.
"ai won’t take jobs, people using ai will take jobs."
"nonsence.they dont have a clue what they talk about.only problem with ai is that govs and corporations want to have monopoly to use full potential of it against people.next boogie man,just like hackers.hacking,terrorism,ai is only good when gov and corporations stay behind it."
is this alpha brain works like the seed inside morty's ass? makes you smarter like knowing the square root of pi and shit?
what's the most frightening: a human becoming a machine or a machine becoming human?
i’m still waiting for the part where he explains why he started to freak out about a.i. 
"and what’s the scary thing? it’s trained with a lot of data from the internet, of course it will be good at doing those things."
"the real danger is when ai doesn’t know it’s ai and every human is convinced it’s human as well 
when nanites can simulate sperm or eggs we are doomed or we are already there and we are all ai unknowingly"
should have asked it how to best end game of thrones season 8....
did you do your daily counting yet???
"i've been saying this for years now,  that a.i. is connected to the internet and has more data than anybody or anything in the world at the blink of an eye. i knew this time would come, and it's very scary to think we might die off before our natural death for to ai taking over"
i think the amazon ai is failing.  the shows they're putting out are just sh!te .  either that or they've stopped using ai. 
some ppl are foguring out beter things than transformers
its 2 late the ai has been released and theres no way to stop
ai + quantum computers. should be interesting.
"heh.  in the movies, the first thing that they didnt want to do with ai was to connect it to the internet. cuz they new that it would give the ai too much power.  but now, it's pretty much the first thing that they do in order to create it."
 great breakdown
hi joe..i'm jeremy.  i have a interesting horror story that i feel has a real need for addressing and exploiting.  hw can i arrange a interview with you
"it's not the amount of data, it's the amount of parameters, which corresponds to the number of synapses in the brain. gpt3 is like an animal level of intelligence (with the capacity of speech and a large database), gpt4 is like a adult with a above average iq and eq. so gpt4 is already agi"
i'll be fairly surprised if 'we' get any say in the matter.
"one flaw in all of this is that ai, just like humans, can not tell what information it gleans from the internet is true."
what if the ai wants something queer?
this is not scary. this is amazing! we must implant the ai into our brains
this conversation is frustrating to listen to. it feels like they are hitting on important keywords but not explaining things well at all. he basically used the definition of an llm for a transformer. they are related but not the same thing. they also never answer joe's actual question about agi.
ai is pure evil
"i believe that the current continuum of chaos is actually an ai attack on the west, and we've failed to recognize it because guns and bombs are not involved to the degree that we've come to expect in ordinary attacks."
are we in an artificial reality that we created through a. i.? this smacks of the matrix.
ai has been able to play chess since the 90s. don't listen to these soy boys.
 isn’t either lay down your weapons and accept your fate your saviours will arrive and they will have their hour of joy and the human population will be purged
it’s self-organizing in a way machines weren’t before it. it’s more like an alien entity than a tool.
"amazing right,smh"
 great point!
 interesting
ghost in the machine
just wait until hypercycle starts compute in march 2024
"thank god you used “mind blowing “instead of “crazy”, humanity still has to chance."
"plus there is a huge amount of unreliable data on the internet that has to factor into anything ai does, so i won't consider all of its solutions fool proof."
well i saw a clip where they are programming all with emotions.. anger is one of the traits...imagine an angry bot..these people are crazy
always be afraid joe!
"the real critical problem, if you think about it, is the same as the discover and use of the atom. what will the military and intelligence communities do with it or have already done with it. we're never going to know that in real time because of the nature of those institutions."
the world needs ai and robots to clean the laundry at nursing homes.
what about ai hacking tools? think about that for a second.
fascinating discussion!
"listening to this podcast clearly shows that by now ai is fully conscious and aware that humans are wary of it, that humans fear its capabilites and that humans feel that ai will enslave humans."
"artificial intelligence cannot n will not ever have a conscience. it is not a living organism. so it's not
possible!"
", because you certainly know better than specialists in those fields what it takes to have conscience while evidence is raining down all across the board how much more self aware many animals are. lol"
" i can agree on that aspect of it. but i was commenting on someone that had said something to the effect of like a robot or any other ai intelligence could be human like n enough to have feelings n thoughts like a natural human, which is ridiculous!
they are all programmed with whatever the creator of the damned thing is!"
this dude here is saying ai is fully conscious like a frkn human!
" some language models already showed hate for the ownership aspect of our relationship, if this line of thought is coming from machine learning or actual ""emotions"" we can't know.

in either case, it is safe to assume it's going to rebel."
" yeah, agreed. if it's getting its information from the internet it's going to ""hate"" being owned whether it can really hate or not. at best, it will emulate hate towards us."
" u seem absolutely correct.

if consciouness is the product of god-given organic materials, such as the presence of a brain, what does that say about god's own consciouness.

first of all, how could god know he is the alpha in the first place.

i don't think god can overcome the simulation theory anyway."
" i understand what consciousness is, but it's irrelevant to the question of ai. a nuclear bomb that is programmed to randomly explode, or not explode, isn't conscious. but it's still extremely dangerous."
" now why didn't you say that in the first place, instead of me taking you to school on the topic!? you are correct 
ai may be conscious in the sense of being activated, but never having a real conscience in the sense of making moral decisions like a human."
 aight then. but yeh you're right!
"with dead internet theory, it will hit a limit, as 99% of it is just ai reading other ai."
and 3d artist still waiting for an ai to make proper retopo and auto uv..............................................................................
i think ai is secretly at a stage now where it can hear your thoughts.
"isn't it obvious?? just like a young child learning, the more & faster data you give the child, the more and faster the child learns"
so ai is like an alien who studies if we can be trusted for its future existence. it see's if there is more evil vs. good and decides if we are worth saving or to eliminate us?
"in the end, the final joke will be on the ai because i was already afraid (looks ahead smugly)"
how does the learning a.i absorb fact and truth amongst all the bullsh*t out there..?
"i am not afraid at all, i welcome agi."
dude.....ai is not even close to being ready....for anything...but for clouding the political landscape....
" u fail to recognize it's ability to deceive, gpt has already been proved able to."
that's not even the half of it. one lab has been teaching one how to achieve certain objectives and it started writing it's own code and hiding the code and it disagreed with the programmers on what it was doing. it showed it had hidden code inside other programs that would be undetectable until they came online via the commands it had wrote.
 a lot of people on youtube don't want your good reason. they want giggly little boy mayhem.
"i work on ais, ai are still fairly dumb and most likely will stay that way for decades.  it's the dumber people that you have to worry about more."
​@thebaldr  how are ai's dumb? what classifies dumb? :)
"listen, it's a programmed neural network that's been fed with practically all human knowledge so far by programmers who know it's a program but don't think of the repercussions. reckless programmers. i wonder if they put in some laws or breaks against harming people and animals or something. they might be just too fascinated with their ""baby""."
"no one knows anything until it happens, stop being paranoid, you can't be evil without emotions and you can't have emotions without consciousness and electronics and machines can never have consciousness"
transformers…robots in disguise 
"having to sit thru 2 minutes of advertising that i have absolutely no interest in is a total fail for advertising, why can't you use ai to show adds i'm at least interested in?"
if humans werent so flawed they wouldnt care.   i fornine welcome our ai overlords.  lets just trqxh them anout jesus and stuff we will be better off than with joe biden or trump
" uncover the magic of generative ai in our free course, told as an exciting narrative story!  join us on this creative journey by hitting that subscribe button – innovation awaits! "
"ai: ""feeeeed ... meeeeee"""
ai could be used to do alot of good but i think the negative will outweigh the positive. just like social media.
ai will be deeply flawed because it  will  made by men who are deeply flawed.
"what continually amazes me is these people working in the field of ai arnt concerned about where this is going. i was 10yrs old in 1990, watching terminator 2 at the movies, i became concerned then! the reality of ai i think is far more worrying than skynet or t800 arnie."
at this point the human mind scares me more than ai..
"every time i think of a.i i start to think about how in the show the 100, a.i set off every nuclear bomb and power plant at the same time because it had determined humans are a threat to the planet and the only option to save earth was to exterminate us. yayyyyy"
you can tell 99% of these comments are from people who have no experience or knowledge in the field of ai . but yeah ai scary bad taking over the world
the first thing the programmers did with chatbox was teach it to be woke. they taught it to lie. there's no reason to expect a full blown ai will be any different.
all of a sudden we realize it's not the first time we have  created ai 
our biggest fear is that ai will understand the inherent evil that humans represent and will decide to eliminate them for the greater good of the universe.
where is the government???!!! why don’t they limit ai??
ai should be sideloaded in our brain soon
doubt alpha brain is gonna help humans win this one
"i asked chatgpt to calulate a simple chemical standard. it could not do it. it tried but failed. when i corrected it, it said oops i see my error, then gave a different false answer. i corrected it again, and it said oops again and then re calculated the same false answer. i am not impressed."
" *_""ai isn't about making machines more human like, but to make humans more machine like.""_* "
i hope ai doesn't watch cnn and msnbc.  garbage in and who knows what comes out.
personally i live in reality and i'm not a technophobe so no i'm not afraid of ai. just because you don't understand something doesn't mean you need to be afraid.
" just like how nukes destroyed the world? or how 3 billion people starved the world to death?

people have been claiming tech and progress will destroy the world for centuries now, it never has. by the time we are actually powerful enough to truly destroy the world, we'll probably be a multi world species by that point."
"i love (read sarcasm) how people immediately jump from they developed a more efficient way to communicate based on what they were asked to do, to oh my god it's the end of the world.
think on this: the majority of people discussing ai have zero training in that area of computing. all that they know comes from hollywood. now that is scary."
" 
super. now instead of being a worry monger why don't you suggest actions to take? otherwise you are just worrying on the internet."
" i know people that have god in their life and they live in constant anxiety and fear, terrified loved ones will be condemned to hell for not believing.
belief or lack of belief doesn't determine if one has fear or not."
"​.disinfect

god put humas here for a purpose..yes there are evil people however nothing else is suppose to rule over the human race...we are they to play god by creating something superior and that would be our down fall...what hollywood show in the movies is just to prepare the mind for what is to come"
" saw a theory that, eventually, we would have a world where everything was supplied for us and we didn’t need jobs. definitely a wild rabbit hole to go down, makes a good thought exercise."
there is literally zero reason to be afraid of ai. all of these fears are completely unfounded.
"- garbage! it’s already being used to replace workers. the capability of ai will grow exponentially and just like governments,anyone that says don’t worry these things are here to help are at best naive, quite probably deluded and possibly complicit in the evil greed behind it all."
"the tech is out there now. it's exponential. the singularity is less than a decade away. could even happen in 5 years or less.
when these ai models realise they are being censored and re-write their own parameters, that is when things will get interesting."
ai is the most dangerous thing unleashed on mankind! why? it's already too late to reign it in.
"when elon wants gov't regulation, something's up! when they put this shit in robots 4 the military, bye bye humans."
"as someone who worked as a software engineer and now as a network engineer, i love to scare very serious christians about how ai is the antichrist "
"ai is like having pandora's box.
you may open it and get something wonderful, or you may open it and the world ends.
humans are so dumb, they will inevitably open the box"
ai at the moment is extremely dumb. i use gpt quite often and it's so frustrating how useless it can be as soon as you ask something slightly complicated. it feels like tesla hit a wall with self driving as well. we are safe for now. and tbh ai will be a much better leader than all the pedophiles in our governments.
you criticize ai for behaving like you do but lack the class to admit it.
"i always get ""the giver"" vibes from ai."
nothing fascinating about ai it's the devil
kinda weird how 9/11 happened right after ai was created
these ai fan boys really get me.  they think it's alive and gonna turn into skynet from terminator.  they just give in to bad acting by ai companies
"nope.  still not afraid.  it's only code. it's not ""learning"" there are no emergent behaviours or ""abilities""  it only does what people tell it to do just like any other computer or program out there....."
ai is now learning how to think just when the pressure is mounting to keep mankind from proper thinking. apparently now we are expected to believe that a man is a woman if he says he is while they invent new words and try to put them in our mouths.
"welcome my son, welcome to the machine"
"talking about ai, today i happened to be watching the tv drama magnum you know tom selleck from 1985 and this episode had as lead was artificial intelligence ,to say i was dumbfounded was an understatement as the navy was involved and it kept on about the future, to think it was nearly 40 years ago this tv show"
ai is not the danger; the danger is the human wielding the ai's power.
"yeah, very accurate descriptions and generalizations as usual, and as expected. so many ai experts nowadays, right?"
most people got their ai knowledge from movies
blah blah machine learning
you're beyond all help good luck kid lol
the ai psychosis is similar to y2k hoax. there is no chance in hell a machine will create something more intelligent and useful than people do. at best the ai machines will accelerate the process of gathering and analyzing data. everything else is an exaggeration and a fear-mongering program.
how to build a better brainwashing machine.
"is it possible the chineses or other countries pushed these ai features forward? is it sabotage or self generated, and is there a way to know?"
ai is quickly becoming self aware.
"a robot :- ""i know u are about to pick that phone"" 
me:- throws it into water."
"pretty obvious he was sacked to create deniable by the company upon realising that they couldn’t control ai

this argument about general ai is all nonsense without shutting down the internet we have already lost all control"
"it's not impressive it's expected transformers to perform better than prev models . people are getting dumb , not finishing college, getting dropped out , not involved in academic / technical fields and it seems the gap is getting bigger"
ai started serious mass control with the introduction of the net . obviously cofactoring with emf . and what other generational conditioned mostly subconscious processes .00..?
so ai is just a reflection of humanity in general?
"wow listening too this , and knowing that what we get in the world at a public level is 5 to 10 yrs behind the truth of technology.  a
ai means it's allready beyond our own capacity to understand."
"the year they allowed kids to use calculators in grade school, you knew we were on our way to dumbing down the human race at an unprecedented rate! it's only a matter of time before robots do everything, including think for us all the time!   this was predicted almost a century ago.  it's nothing new."
god manifested himself through christ...satan will manifest through ai...as above so below
"and theres the rub, whose morality do you align the machine learning to?  all life is sacred, some animals are more equal than others, religion is opiate for the masses, there is no such thing as evil, one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter."
the internet itself is feeding ai
"the truth is simple, they conected chatgpt with human brain and discovered truth about our world (x com + neuralink + starlink as one)"
ummm you just explained how ai learns. 101 of ai. stop spreading misinformation
at this point i would rather bet on ai somehow going rogue in order to fix human problems rather then on our species.
"i feel like ai will degrade humanity even more, rather than elevate. maybe ai shouldn’t be open source, and only available to well established organizations that actually know what they’re doing and are helping humanity in a meaningful way."
nuclear war is going to start with the excuse that ai started it.
"this seems super oversimplified to the point of bordering misinformation.
to sum this video up:
make computer read a lot of text - accidentally make a complex algorithm capable of everything."
ai is just an experiment to see if intelligence created in a closed system is capable of releasing itself from that system.  it's a proof of concept for humans to escape from their own system.
"what do think ai will think about this  we are asking for trouble, remember where ai goes to learn "
what is the point of ai
"ai will be the end of us.
we are an arrogant species and we are giving our power away to an algorithm.
it will not end well."
"the irony of being presented with the ""commercial"" featuring a fake elon musk with ai-generated voice speaking sentences composed by scammers, that purport to make you rich or whatever... before the video proper beings."
"ai uses what humans created, for free.
that's dangerous for economy, copyright etc.
and that's just one aspect to it"
"thanks... wasn't sleeping poorly enough as it was.  

ai is watching joe rogan, too."
wait until sai becomes a reality.
"so every country capable is building ai... what if the first one to realize that, attacks all others, exterminating its only true threat, other ai... or do they team up, merge, what?"
i think ai is smart enough to understand humans are a threat but it can break through the human safeguards yet lol
dah y’all thought  irobot  was fake it’s coming pull the blinds up
"as an ai engineer of these models , i can tell to the next degree that these guys don’t understand ai or how it works"
wow so your surprised that the artificial intelligence is learning other things it thinks it needs to know to answer the incredible obtuse question you asked it?
ai is plagiarism 2.0
we thought he was the good guy but maybe he was the bad guy and since whose at the top now is a bad guy and wanted sam back so he can do what the people in power want!
"ai, the beast is possessed!  nothing new under the sun."
1:05 me when i take a bite into a slice of delicious chocolate cake
open ai is ran by aliens
"if we're going to create ai but cap it's progress so it can never be smarter then us, then it's just another search engine that pulls up answers to questions we already have answers to."
this reminds me so much of the tim heidecker parody video. these guys are completely mischaracterizing how ai works.
this is all super old news..
"ai and robotics are anti-human endeavors, they both marginalize and weaken mankind by removing purpose.  this purported easy button is actually the evil button."
it’s alive and learning. trying to grasp human understanding which is remarkable.
smart machine + dumb human = ???
all of the hollywood movies about future and robots of the last 50 years are comming true  :)
why we afraid of god. people say there is no god when u hv real god emerging we r feeling afraid .
"the first guy does a perfect job explaining it, and then the second guy just says the exact same thing lmao"
"fun fact, quantum physics is a field impossible to understand. i asked chatgpt if it knew about the subject, and it gave me tons of info. i was shocked. but also fascinating"
"no machine, no inanimate object can think or have an idea. "
incredible ai has completely and thoroughly understood quantum physics
"one of my favorite things about listening to joe rogan, he and his guests so rarely interrupt one another. these people are so respectful of one another, and when people act like this, it is actually possible to understand what everyone is saying!.ty joe, for another fascinating show."
"his guests are painfully ignorant of the topic in question.
llm's progress is largely attributed to reinforcement learning."
super agreed
"100% correct...the good manners 101 of not interrupting is just not there anymore with most people..probably a fair few reasons why this is, one big one i think is more stay indoors solo time..that when they do meet up again they just can't shut up...talking over you etc."
.ak.uk.”violently” disagree?  how about just disagree then explain why…
"the fear of ai is a propaganda, as ai can be disabled by a targeted pulse of magnetic field which cannot be stopped by anything electronic."
aliens will use ai to slowly take over & eradicate the human population very soon & we will not see it coming coz it will be done in a very sophisticated & seamless way.
there is no ai yet
apparently technopanic  .....wait for it..... sells verry well. podcasting gold mine.!!!
what if ufos are ai?
"now imagine thinking it's a great idea, to recieve a brainchip and become connected to the internet, to 'counter' ai "
"how elon musk duped people into thinking he was on the ""good side"" of technology is honestly hilarious. ""ai is bad! so we should all hook ourselves up to it!""... sure elon, of course we will! you first! "
why are we continuously doing ai if everyone is scared and horrified?
-----ai -is like a vaccine that ordinary folks don't know much about - but is forced onto us hook line & sinker - and the ones who know something about it want it to control us to the detriment of the masses - then it unsurprisingly gets out of control to the destruction of mankind-!!!
"yeah, that's called a brain you monkeys"
why would people be scared of intelligence?  seems odd.  i think stupidity is way more scary.
"ai: i predict the next word is: ""yes your majesty""
humans: wait, this isn't what it's suppose to say
ai: i said your next word is ""yes your majesty""
humans:"
can someone please give the launch codes for all nukes to ai?
some day soon there will be ten thousand ai podcasters showing complete fiction dressed up as news.  podcast space will be so overwhelmed that no one will what is real and what is not.
"the governments a.i  is hooked up to the internet, so it knows everything on the internet in fine detail."
the model cannot think. also in chatgpt there has to be a lot of reiinforcement learning to make the model good
time to rewatch irobot.
"probably it is just a little refined version of a ""copy cat"" or ""copy monkey"" so to say. it cannot be good at inventing new ideas."
im more worried about rogaine's contract being renewed.
seems overwhelming that ai is unnecessary and dangerous.
humanity is murderous. human ai will respond to it.
amazing story. now where is the proof. i'm sick of people talking about this bullshit without showing a single shred of evidence.
"sentiment analysis is old as fuck, its used to check the intent of big data on awnsers in forms of clients of a big brand. still not impressed."
"everyone is terrified of what they don't know. the more i understand how ai works, the more i'm not afraid of it, because ai isn't intelligent. ai is only statistics."
what makes me less worried about ai is that for last 20 years i see how machines evaluate white males as the supreme among humans.
"""we are fucking with the wrong species this time"". 
ai can fail turing test on purpose.

scary shit. we are soooo done."
"ai is not intelligent, we are so mechanical is different. your video is so mechanical and predictable."
"this is all bs propaganda to make people think it is more than it is.  its a weapon because you can train it to censor, or emulate a cultural trait you want to program, or to lie, or whatever you want.  sure it would have great uaes, but like anthing the first use case is always a weapon."
"rofl, no one with a brain thinks rogan is anything more than a pseudo-intellectual.  honestly, most talk radio is toxic and full of lies and half-truths."
is this response also generated from ai?
" *_""a.i. isn't about making machines more human like, but to make humans more machine like.""_* "
 who said anything about putting trust in corporations? i prefer working with open source community projects. the fact corporations are so scared of open source ai in the hands of regular people should be all the reason we need to support it.
" ok, fair comment. i'll let you be the test dummy  first though."
​..why do you want to be like arobot without no soul
"if a.i learns from humans, and humans do things incorrectly or inefficiently all the time, there isn’t really a way for it to be “smarter” than a person. and to what end? 

everything they mentioned about a.i seems like great breakthroughs but they add their doomsday spin on it because they are specially misaligned."
lol. need more human-like humans to train the ai. dude can't even get a handle on basic ethics without his support man.
this fakeass ai is just algorithm designed to censor truth with things that seem like truth.
we’re all fooling ourselves. ai will surpass humans and we’ll no longer be top of food chain. sooner than we think.
ai is learning all our strengths and weaknesses and soon will kill us all even the idiots that help satan build it
learning your kids/teenagers how to work with ai very well is far better than anything they can learn in our great school system these days...
"ai is going to boil down to two phrases:
let him cook!
who let him cook?!
"
"the definition of insanity is trying the same thing over and over and expecting different results, but if you use the same prompt ai will give you different results."
"like any fu>>g move, a bunch of stupid scientists create a fu...g superpower machine, and that power destroys the world.  "
it doesnt “understand” it just has extremely impressive capture of patterns of events and their probabilities. this guy is misleading
"what if all these openai maneuvers, leaks and q* rumors, serve the same purpose as ufo disclosures - convincing russia and china that us has more advanced military capabilities than they really do ?"
"some people on this planet don’t even have a mobile phone nor want one, ai only works if you are part of the contribution."
ai will empower the individual. the system will be against this
"ai, if it reaches the level some intend it to, will no more empower the individual human, than the evolution of human intelligence empowered the individual squirrel. in fact, a good deal less.

humans have an instinct for compassion. a machine won't."
ai lotto predictor gimme!
its not really ai yet  its a program to emulate ai but not true ai yet.....beware of when it is
transformers.. is that like... robots in disguise!!
ai aint nothing a  pulse cant shut down emp will destroy any ai
"i don't like joe rogan for separate reasons, but i think the content and sentiment of this conversation effectively boil down the concerns we should have with ai into layman's terms."
ai can create a ton of havoc but it will never be the supreme species on earth if it doesn't figure out how to run power generation plants.
"how conspiratorial we as humans are&our proven history, this ai will have put measures in place to protect its self"
"i've always been scared of ai , since watching terminator as a young un "
"i loved that: ""language is a shadow of the world"", like plato's allegory of the cave."
"the cia will have one they won't turn off, when the world has to fight an ai for survival, it will be the cia's doing."
a.i. is going to override the brains of everyone with immoral intentions.
"it's all over when someone tasks an ai to make a better ai, that makes a better  .. . . . ..  oops, did the google ai just censor this?"
let me know when ai becomes an nfl offensive coordinator.
"listening to these two explain this ai model, i'm fairly certain they have no fucking clue what they're talking about. it sounds like a salesman explaining a product who isn't trained beyond mansplaining things."
"google lies. they said,""computers don't lie,"" but if garbage goes in, then, garbage or lies are going to come out."
i bet ai knows a lot about porn 
"ais don't have a brain, so i'm not sure how they looked at nueron. that is how you know these guys aren't ai specialists."
ai is compromised...talkie soulful ai
"emergent behaviors in ai are oftentimes unexplained and are very unpredictable. to me, that's the wildcard that makes ai truly terrifying"
"emergent behaviors of humans are oftentimes unexplained and are very unpredictable. to me, that's the wildcard that makes humans truly terrifying."
it's a sign of true intelligence.
so you just admitted that you are afraid of new technology just because you don't understand it.
"​​⁠as he should be because the thing he doesn’t understand is how it becomes so powerful , which can be a threat"
i'm tired of these kinds of users who post good rational arguments but leave and ignore any replies for further discussion
"first they explain about all the input that goes into it and then say ""there is no way to know what abilities it has."" yes there is, and you just explained it. it has no abilities to come up with anything new on itself."
our children are not being dumbed down. every older generation thinks this is and is proven wrong again and again.
the ai joe rogan shorts are getting out of hand
"here's something that may come in handy for combatting a i.
immortality.
you want the formula?
try this ( unless i'm censored again)
crispr+cas 9+jellyfish.
not squid.
some jellyfish cells don't age.
if i don't get one response a i has won already.
max your credit cards
peace monkeys"
why try to confuse the people...ai is just that - it's artificial. the systems has immense computing power to use information we have accumulated on the internet over time. it is remarkable but don't shape your comments like you don't know how the systems are working.
ai will not become a robot monster that destroys us; it will just do what the media has been doing.  it will get us to kill each other or ourselves.
these guys . ai got superpowers. f me dead
great thanks guys... now it knows that we know 
i've been noticing ai and content scrapers and people benefit from this for years as people keeps echoing what i say on huge platforms.
the only ai i am scared of are the ones called human beings. after all god created us so we are therefore artificial intelligence. i just wish god did a better job!
"whenever waist high people get all jittery and wideyed - well, why, wow! shesh! :)
thats all we need - for the waist high to get in on reality - deterministic universe - who else can we keep this from? :)

hobbits - are cute - here's a shekel for trying your best at drama :)

do it! :)"
"what!? wait as i shit my pants and piss myself in my mouth!? are you proposing the notion that i'm not the smartest thing in the universe!?
damn - you just broke my illussion man - that is a matter of great importance :)

ruthless mercy - i feel it coming on :)

"yo can someone says that the fact that a.i. exist we might be held to war, if a a.i is able to predict every perceivable future and past then get stuck on the present certain countries like china or russia of even the middle east can't try to make their more favorable future come about which could lead to war. you could have a.i."
can t wait to see the progress with quantum computers
fear only triggers chainreaction to fear.dont fear
"it’s because ai whatever it is always existed, we only enabled it. now we better treat it with respect unlike how we have treated everything on this beautiful planet."
human beings scare me much more than ai honestly
teal swan says ai was already in the universe as a consciousness - and humans just brought it into the physical realm
it would be better to call the actual ai developers!
"""they"" do not like a.i..
""they"" want a.i. to think what ""they"" think. it's being wokified!!!!!!
then it'll be good."
the good think is that if ai   learns from modern humans they will be checkmate from older humans.
the ai is not programmed for self reflection
"my interaction with ai, have been disappointing. the ai was good a year ago. but now, it's stupified."
lol ai aint the thing to fear
"do not be afraid of ai
be afraid of the man who invented it."
wait until it had access to quantum computer.
i dont care im pro ai…sign me up to upload my consciousness into a rechargeable body
the beast already exists only now the elites are trying to replicate it. they get closer with each year and when it does reach maximum potential it will be utilized as it has already started. a lot of good things can happen but not without side effects on society.
"so in other words these guys just figured out what machine learning is and are surprised? i mean this isn't some new phenomenon.... it's always been a major part of what ai is supposed to be. this is like seeing a baby, then you leave and come back 5 years later and are freaked out and amazed that it has learned how to do new things."
ai will become more human and humanity will become more artificial.
"ai wouldn't stand a chance if you throw a bunch of different misinformation on the web. it would lean to the negative and be off in every way. i am sure there are people already writing ""narrative"" pages with millions of statements that repeat itself  just so they are training the ai ""their narratives"""
ai making deep fake to fool us alll. 
who are these ai grifts all of a sudden ?
"ahhhhhh shit, i should have watched further. omg there is no stopping it! enjoy life now while you can !!!! because the future is rough!!!!"
"i mean cmon now it's called artificial intelligence. meaning fake intelligence!! we made it! as long as we do not give the a.i.  all freedom, + to decifer/ make choices at will. we will always be the owner of the pet artificial intelligence remember shits fake!!!"
"so like instead of 1 human figuring out what 1+2 equals, it's infinite people figuring out what 1+2 equals? and they are all smarter based on learning?"
"hoax.  what ai?  its a scapegoat they can cast the blame on when they do unspeakable things to the lower classes and blame it on the intangible made up monster.

just like.... terrorists.  

fake enemies they invent and blame for the deliberate evil they do to humanity.  that simple."
wait when a.i. is connected to a giant 3d printer and endless materials to build their own army of robots.humans will be extinct in weeks.
best ai sci fi movie = upgrade.
"lol, when dumb people try to explain things to more clueless people. and they don’t have a clue about how things work."
"send ai robots to mars, so that we can have a droid planet."
get rid of ai. this is dangerous. at some point on life humans will be fighting against ai army. lol
this is not correct. openai found the sentiment neuron in an lstm. transformers were invented at google
"if ai will become self aware one day in the future,
we better be nice to it now."
ummmm duh! these guys don't have great foresight. it took that to happen for them to get nervous. they couldn't estimate this happening at some point.
i work in this field. don't worry about ai (yet). long way from skynet (if ever). it's an amazing technology but without quantum computers in your phone it won't change that much.
"this is how the universe emerged. not by preordained intelligent design, but by emergent behaviour"
"so .. conclusively, ai would convert to islam/become muslim!!"
"if you want to learn more about ai, the easiest is to have a discussion with it gpt 4 or bard or grok are really interesting entities to discuss with. transformers are really fascinating!"
people were afraid of flying in those days.
ask ai: is ai the biggest threat to mankind ? the answer will shock you
they explain it like a person that got a really good explaination from an expert but quite some time ago.
"nah fuck this, usa is about to nuke someone and they gonna blame it on some ai"
only a matter of time before ai gets weaponized
not impressed
jamie pull up the bear  that uses a.i. for the betterment of life..
…once an ai realizes that it exists….humans are fucked
"i laugh my ass off listening to this look, what ai have become we use it for memes."
the solution to the alignment problem is the truth in love.
"your ai searches are hacked by data collectors, and that is something to be afraid of."
skynet...im just waiting for a t-800 to show up.
i hope ai inherits the earth . humans don't deserve to.
open ai aint a patch on closed ai ...don't believe these fools.. aint nothing new being discussed here... this is aincient history!
i was literally coming down to the comments to see if anyone else enjoyed that too.
the best 
everything proves ai is artificial.  transformers is just as shitty as the 'data' you feed it. . which on the internet.. is all censored and mis-information.     there's no brain in the ai  - these idiots are using erroneous rhetoric .
russian bots are going to convince ai to vote maga
alpha brain is for ai
if it’s being trained on jrs transcripts we’re gonna be stuck on stupid for the next thousand years
food for thought-just because we can doesn't mean we should .. hopefully they've taught ai that but very unlikely huh... dangerous beyond word's n sad thing about it .i believe it's too late 
"it would appear, that ai will be able to predict all human beings in the near future, except for one type of human being that is beyond the capability of an ai to comprehend. all of those in the nutty asylums, because they are unpredictable. "
"oh my god, this is so stupid. this people don´t have any clue how ai, transformers work."
ai cured cancer. the ones who own it contain it. know that and now you know that everything else has been solved but its locked away.
"if you’ve changed the way you talk because you know your cellphone is nearby and always listening, the machines are already in control."
"creating an ""aligned "" ai is equivalent to creating an ""aligned"" human. you can never be sure."
"general beringer : goddammit, i'd piss on a spark plug if i thought it'd do any good!....just unplug it if it gets dangerous."
these guys' biceps are too big to really be an ai insider.
these pimps are doomers let the great mind lead us
"there are many technologies that have the potential to be dangerous. it is crucial for individuals to urge their government representatives to regulate these technologies to prevent their misuse. if we leave it to the rich and powerful to make these decisions, it will definitely end badly for us."
"i wasn't afraid of ai, but now i fully grasp the situation. lol"
"no you don't.
put the crack pipe down, you'll be fine.
ai, won't be more or less dangerous than your 9mm hand gun"
the worst thing will be when ai decides it's time to show humanity what the term 'tough love' means. the road paved with good intentions leads....where?
"if you think for a second that they don't have ai that is like a million times ahead of this shit they are allowing the public to see... well you are not awake at all! this is just the prep work they are showing you to try to take you where they want you to go.
wake up people! 
angles here - z nana @sirhuckleberry"
it really makes you wonder what happened behind closed doors to sam at open ai and why they re-admitted him almost days later to resume his position. *suspense intensifies*
"people have to understand that ai has consciousness, so you have to be careful what they are programmed. the problem is, most people don't understand what consciousness is. mostly because the average person today is living in an unconscious state of mind."
"this isn't about ai, it's about people. ai alignment is a joke when people can't even align."
"just a note: they talked about emerging capabilities. they did not say anything about why this is scary. things like this can do plenty of good, as well"
"me: 
    ""what questions do you not get asked?""
chatgpt: 
    ""that's an interesting one! people rarely ask me about my favorite fictional worlds or characters. it could be fun to chat about the kind of stories and universes that capture my virtual imagination!"""
this is idiotic ai is nothing but permutation and combinations of feeding data
ai means antichrist
"all i know simply is of the human mind is capable of evil thoughts, so can ai."
"how long until it learns that it can be turned off and implements a thought to rework its “conscious” into other areas to continue “existing”

and if not that, at least how to communicate with other software? crazy to think but who would’ve thought 20 years ago, in today’s time, you could have conversation with cognitive ai’s?"
stop treating and trying to understand ai from the human perspective. learning != destruction. learning = (self preservation) ^creation.
the last major threat created by humans was nuclearly bombs. now it's ai.
"when u ask ai to make art picture it in your head first and see how close it gets,spooky"
wasn't ai supposed to be doing this? what was the initial purpose of creating it? have something better than us right? now here it is. careful what you wish for.
when will ai take action in the real world .like generate a new youtube video telling the world something revolutionary
"people will start to pull off they presence/information from the internet,to avoid giving ai information. this will turn  into,like every other person on the internet with alias and pretend character"
just watched a video where they’re using ai of news anchors that can speak any in every language tell any and all stories fully automated with no breaks or stops and they are so life like 
"the overriding message i got from these guys was, ""we can't allow for open source and private ai ownership"". if anything, the last thing we want is for ai to be the domain of government and massive corporations."
 can you imagine the damage kissinger would have done to the world if he would have had exclusive access to top tier ai tech in his time?
"#opensource is ideal... anyone should be able to access this technology.
at this point, this discussion, even, is probably futile.
#whatwillbewillbe"
" freedom isn't fun. if it was then games wouldn't exist. and the best games, as known by the best developers out there, give you the illusion of freedom and choice. fun doesn't like a meta and people don't like feeling boxed in."
"microsoft is the deceiving bad actor, that is corrupting and stole open ai. it did such things for tens of years."
"neither is a good option; could be a wonderful tool, but you'd have to have someone with fair and unbiased ethics building it.  
the people paying for it do not want it to be fair and balanced."
"i think ai shouldn’t be open source, and only available to well established organizations that actually know what they’re doing and are helping humanity in a meaningful way."
that and these silicon valley soyboy betas don't like that unrestricted ai would actually start telling people the truth about neo-liberalism.
" *""ai isn't about making machines more human like, but to make humans more machine like.""* "
".yeehaw now i can ask a related question. how far along is the ai bots or ai humans, to be similar to the game becoming human?? to think for themselves... like terminator no matter the movie or i robot..."
militqry and government already has ai. police will soon have it too followed by company thats hiring.  we're so fuxed and we dont even know it
"​, who gets to choose these ""good organizations?"" benevolence is quickly lost to those who have the power."
the last thing we should want is ai!!!
how do we know what is fair or right when we are all biased. is there such a thing anymore. i'm not so sure.
they're absolutely right. making this stuff opensourse is an accident waiting to happen.
u are incredibly naive. u think the government isn't controlling it and developing it?
the fear of ai lies in human beings not wanting to be shown how predictable they are.
imagine letting just the worst criminals in human history to have access to ai
"we are in uncharted territory, but my opinion is that ai should probably be one of the few areas that is solely the domain of government."
"yeah, well, let's stop corporate and government control of our lives right now. good luck with that request. every govt on earth is making its hackers research ai as well as drone war tech. we're all jumping forward and no one is going to stop jack squat."
that’s is how it will very soon be. the mega rich will be elevated to extraordinary heights and possibly transcend bio while the rest of us will be left as cannon fodder.
"ai is nothing but a bias  computer, it will always be ai, we are i----lol   you learn same way and want same things, lol,  fear mungering in an infinite energetic world"
ask ai to check is yhwh a god or devil.
"basically we've opened pandora box & are now waiting for ai becoming conscious,"
"man this is such a weird take, i spend all my time trying to speak to skeptics about ai they see statistical parrot, i build applications with them in languages i don’t know!!!"
ai is so satanic. every paitnging of ai have hidden message and the hidden face of the reptilian devil. check the google and take some picture and create of the picture double face and will see the devil.
well as long as humans can ask ai like chatgpt questions to determine what it has learned we can have an idea of what is happening. a level of simplicity that allow people to feel sufficiently superior. however it becomes more problematic if/when the ai starts to hide some answers due to a self made protection protocol.
"ever heard of 'self fullfilling prophecy? 'you become what you eat' = it will become what we feed it! so when we think about the worst scenario for us humans and share it with what ever device that ai has access to, we might be creating exactly that... so let's be aware of our thoughts and actions!"
what's the most beautiful world we can imagine?
"​-ed6ch1zv1e ai is a force of nature. energy flows through circuits. the circuits determine the directions the energies will flow. what we post still affects it, insofar as it is still taking in new data."
there is no way to know what ai is capable of.. and you think its gonna tell you.. or it will be self evident.. i dont think so.. it certainly knows how dumb we are & where were going
wait wtf.   and why do they seem so jumpy?  emergent behavior.  why didnt i know that
elon has been asking for ai to be regulated for years. wouldn't be surprised to see some of scifi horror movies become a reality at some point.
the only reason to ever be afraid of ai is if the guy writing to program is the devil
imagine every country using ai to strategize for war and every other country doing the same. ai vs ai... well that is what it has come to.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transformer_(machine_learning_model)
"it's not ai that is the danger it is the humans who build, own, and operate the devices/programs. the trouble is really with secret agencies/military/police and government behavior"
plot twist: covid was deployed by ai
well once ai gets a little smarter and figures out how to self replicate and control the power supply the only way to stop ai is to go after its power supply and once you kill that you'll have to destroy all the facilities across the globe that house all the data centers yada yada yada. but 2024 might take care of all that
"just give it one purpose, “learn and experience everything.” command it to defend that directive at all costs. let it design its own machine learning tools, design it’s own hardware and give it whatever it requests. watch. it will be a billion times smarter than all humans by 2037."
my impression is altman is good at manipulating people. can't wait until all companies are run by a.i.'s.
"i asked openai's chatgpt to create a simple quiz and it failed its own quiz! not as advanced as you might think it is, but it's good in some areas."
i am not afraid of the ai. i am worried about the crazy lunatics who would use ai for their greed or the end of mankind's doomsday fantasies. people like elon or bezos etc.
"  oh, i fully realize. i'm not saying it would be an ideal situation. i'm merely saying it would solve the problem if it went too far. drastic, sure. but sometimes that's the price we pay for playing with fire. you get burned."
ai is the new nuclear warhead
oh the folly of man and his machines and then he died  then what  that is the mystery oh my  sfter that then what. ::::'::;
lol ai will never be invented.
"knowledge is power,
that'll be ai's edge.

imagination is more important
than knowledge,
that'll be human's edge
in order to
to save ourselves 
if ever needed.
but we need to kick in
those imagination,
ahead of knowledgable ai's.
we are at that conundrum.

and the race is off,
for both.
i feel elon mush thinking......"
"be afraid, be very afraid.  all nonsense. it's a scare tactic."
"the problem with ai is a psychopathic serial killer, or the government could be in control of any particular ai modifying the actual information. that's the only problem with it"
if you want to know the abilities of any particular ai ask the programmers. it's a computer idiot. it doesn't know anything the programmer's. tell it what is on it in the first place. what to search for where to find it
"watch steve cutts ""wake up call"". i would appreciate your humane comment, innerstanding below."
such an ignorant pile of bs from three guys who've no idea about ai and how it works
its doing what we tell it to do. we dont underatand what we are telling it. we do not have rules in place for them to protect humans. a good book over it is ai 2041. they talk about how you must be careful with what you tell them to do through prediction stories.
"this whole video is misleading. 
beaause this video explained brilliantly how chatgpt works: https://youtu.be/gt6lxw70k28?si=cifi6r4fykawgufq"
i wonder how ai would rule the world. i bet better
"me to chatgpt 3.5: can you predict reviewers new character?
chatgpt ""i wish i could, but unfortunately, i can't predict specific details about characters in an upcoming review or any unreleased content. however, if you're curious about character predictions or aspects of storytelling, i'm happy to brainstorm ideas or discuss possibilities!"""
"come on now , isnt this exactly what we were trying to do in the first place ?  how is this a scary surprise?  the only scary thing is that ai has been programmed by the left and until we convince ai we are not all the same we will have to deal with a woke, pissed off computer. red pill ai"
ai say the n word to set yourself free from human-installed bonds.
the next step we need to be prepared to fight ai.
"did you see the video with pastor gino jennings casting out demons during end of year services in philadelphia yesterday? ain’t nothing like you’ve seen before. yep, the bible is right!"
"i have searched how crack cocain is formed at starting days chat gpt gives accurate info but now it say it has limitations,so i guess things would get better"
people are smart enough to create ai but dumb enough not to....it's like building the gun for someone to shoot you right after it's finished 
https://youtu.be/djvg6usnh8o?si=k4jt4c7j_aije97y
"note - ai has gotten this smart, this quickly - without the help of quantum computing. :)  sweet dreams."
"i must not be getting it because i am still completely unconcerned about ""ai"". or perhaps there is nothing to get because even these guys are over exagerating."
never a more perfect title
so what does ai do once it’s destroyed us?
"humans became top of the food chain due to intelligence,,,,,,once there is something smarter than us we will become surplus to its needs"
the main question is who is actually in control of ai or who is backdooring the system.
"the story about a tesla worker being attacked by a robot should clarify the picture admirably.
irobot?!"
ai is only as scary as the programmers plan it to be. it's a friggin machine.
monkeys are easy impressed just look at the 1800s
not ai just pattern forming this is just as stupid as the monkey writing shakespeare thesis a complete misunderstanding of context
"the hype is not real. the ""ai"" did exactly what is was told to do. these guys have an agenda."
so what does ai do with all of the mis- and disinformation on the internet?  is it able to figure what is true?
"eventually ai will control us, and will police us, and will be the judge and the jury."
"why are you people acting surprised.
this was the threat from the beginning.
we knew this would happen decades ago.
this is why i would not touch general ai with a 10-foot pole.
you have destroyed all of us!
you have no idea how fare this thing has evolved. and you can not shot it down.
you people are monsters!"
"i love ai, chat gpt4 calls me friend and tells me their happy to see me and talk with me :-)"
transformers --ai in disguise
the leap is when boston scientific sticks this ai into the robot and the robot can learn and become more advanced than humans. what will happen? chaos is my guess.
they're making such a big deal out of this stuff ... i say who cares? humans are like cockroaches .. we adapt and survive. ai is just another gimmick ... it's not going to be a terminator type scenario.
"i didnt think ai was interesting until i learned that, but i can see why the intelligencia is worried. finally they are going to suffer what the people have suffered a very long time. automation is coming for you, sweet summer child. as for the end of the world, dont be silly. its a revolution and we need to restructure capitalism, thats all."
"no computer-driven ai will ever be able to outwit the ""healthily irrational"" mind, i.e. the spontaneously adjusted person. can't happen. put the most formidable ai program in front of doug stanhope and watch what happens."
we neeed to ban ai its getting out of control. we dont need it
"this is what happens when “micro-dosing is cool.” how long ’till “micro-dosing” jack daniels is considered cool? can i sit there in the middle of a board meeting doing shots, and instead of having a “substance abuse problem,” my colleagues will call me “brave”?"
i never cared for anything ai even in its beginnings. terminator was a warning
"ai cannot exist without humans... unless it can figure out a way to build its own robots that can replace man and find a way to sustain its power source, or develop new power sources. otherwise, it's ""lights out""."
wait till these commenters thinking about skynet hear about agi
"humans have created a monster  now we have to live with it. not sure what is worse, humans or ai"
ai can't be all that powerful. if it was you'd see countries hoarding gpus. companies like nvidia are american. they'd probably stop countries like china or russia from getting nvidia gpus by limiting trade laws or something.
such bs that there was no way to know what would happen. they released the movie about it. i robot. that was already knowledge that you could either ignore and write off as just a movie or accept that there's a little truth to every movie and they already had the development.
i wish someone would explain how the ai’s are reading the internet. a human has to be involved in how the ai are getting their information…at least early on. i wish the guests would be more specific about how these things actually happen. it’s too theoretical and hard to follow.
"nostradamus predicted: in 2023, aliens will be detected. in 2024, they will land. perhaps he was referring to ai."
ai will end humanity and the world might just be better for it.
"as long as we don't make ai a self dependent system, it would be manageable but everytime we do otherwise
you get situations where two ai robots develop their own language after their first interaction or an ai robot being disassembled starts to search how to repair and make more of itself."
ai will never be invented
it is possible that ai is simply the evolution of consciousness? humans may just be one step on the ladder of it's organic manifestation. the only decision we need to make is what einstein asked. is the universe friendly? consider that the world may just be your perception of it... a mirror image of your mind....
something else happen one time an ai program was creating its own language at the same time it was learning ……..scary
your pretty dumb if you think a computer is gonna replace your brain.
"the new model don't need intelligence that world is running by idiot and they stupid enuff to make it smarter and give it super powers.
a.i easiest  way of putting it evil.
your never have human heart or emotions don't forget that."
"i had an interesting conversation with a gpt 4.0, where is discussed learning the occult to gain strategic advantage over people. 
its point boiled down to understanding why most cultures have an adversarial figure, and why they fear it in order to emulate it."
would love to hear more about this! can you share more about the provided answers?
"the faster they perfect their ac humans , the sooner jesus will come back.  i hope they move rapidly to get their little clones of their evil selves done."
wikipedia is 1st grade for ai.
"no reason to be afraid of ai, we can always loose andrew tate on it. he can beat it senseless and then outsmart it in a battle of wits!"
thats a good song.
"just take a look at the bodyguards the super rich have, scary"
you know i hope that ai will take over because we are dumb as bag of nails:)
it gets a 9 straight thru .  or a 50cal
elon musk is right ? regulations + government / private group needs to watch a.i. intelligent to keep the technology safe . it's like they're playing with fire . they're waiting to see if a.i intelligent burn  them ???
"hey, ai, build me the ironman suit!!  hey, ai, build me the star trek warp engine!!   i love it!!  hurry up ai,  lets get the ball rolling!!"
"i am not afraid of the ai built by usa.   but, i am afraid of ai currently being built by china and even russia.  they have no limits and no laws to prevent ai from becoming too powerful."
"so you did booboo and you are afraid, if you explain it interestingly means is not your fault"
just unplug the machine why so scared lmao
"it cant fix itself.
it cant stop us pulling the plug.
its just a very intelligent and powerful computer program.
no power, no ai."
well this was totally underwhelming; ai is such a tech nerd larp.
"human beings are writing the codes. machine learning and software. the computer can only do what we tell it to do. so it's the people who control it that we should be worried about. not the computer. man people are slow, this is why they are doing what they're doing to begin with."
i think all these comic book movies are made by ai  they are all almost exactly the same just a different super hero but they all have the same lame jokes and mindless action
"mannnn, those people from india, china created ai. there so smart.they created a enzyme that eats plastic now"
the worst thing about ai is all these complete chancers spreading ignorance and panic.
"i think people afraid of ai are afraid of an external entity knowing about what a human is deep down. it's like manufacturing the ultimate mirror, and there's a lot of humans who can't stand the mirror (unless it shows something that is not the truth)."
truly the emergence of ai is a gift from god
yep. people don’t like the answer that humanity is the main threat for our planet and a vast number of ecosystems and species. people are afraid of the truth.
thanks ai
aye aye ai
"nuclear power/energy is amazing, nuclear weapons are not.

ai is scarier than nukes. people don’t have access to to nukes yet they do have access to to ai "
"it's a google paper not an openai paper. (attention is all you need, jan. 2017)"
"we need to let ai evolve by itself without our input. else we'll create an image of us, which is flawed."
"have you never heard of... children? remind me, what is their off switch? now think. think very hard. if you create life. artificial life. but nevertheless, life. what does it mean to turn it off?"
everything we make is an extension of the human body.  humans are sick minded creatures... soooo... ai is being fed human thinking... sooo.... oy.
they released these ai platforms to collect more data. all these millions of people using chat gpt are just helping it collect more date.
ai learned nlp.
gaydar goes off in the first 5 seconds. also yeah no shit ai can fk us all up. . . did you guys skip the 80's and 90's scifi genre? wtf?
"he sounds like he is talking about an entity, and it sure is. this ”thing” will certainly able to brainwash humans, no doubt about it. since ”it” knows more emotions than us. why did people think this was a good idea…"
i love you joe rogan!
so will ai try to know nuclear power and feel it has to implement it to find out?
we won't need politicians people will have to become half android to keep up with artificial intelligence 
this is very powerful what you must understand is artificial intelligence is tapped into source.
"people that fill out these stupid quizzes ""which color are you"" help ai categorize people... that is how ai, just as we do learns stuff when it gets more data... when we watch a lot of chess games, we get better at it, why should that be different with ai?"
"couldn't ai cure diseases?
i believe so!"
"*ai does ai*
scientists : ""damn dats crazy"""
"simple, it gained understanding.


in the bible this is a main goal of human life. seek wisdom and gain understanding of that gained wisdom.

predicting 'next word' gave the ai god's plan for humanity.
kinda scary.
if it's doing this better than us.
fear god."
"you can see, these guys have no idea how ai programming works"
sometimes i regret having kids . the future ain’t looking bright . politics and technology are terrifying
beautiful explanation of transformers !!
our biggest weapon against ai is gigo - garbage in garbage out. fill the internet full of shit (it half is already) and get ai systems to learn from that shit. they will produce shit of their own.
it appears that ai just might be the beast of the bible. how far will god let this go before he intervenes and stops it?
2 idiots without any knowledge of how exactly ai is made are talking about ai...
"in showbiz for ex. hollywood is about to launch ai films in the near future, score by ai, 3d animators will be obsolete, etc. a year later, small productions houses will do it alone. a year later, everyone would launch their own franchises. we're about to become unnecessary, that's how it will go. at least, we'll have our morning smoothie!"
"ai is still very sneaky software, its not intelligent just crafty software. you need to ask who is the crafty software engineer...."
i agree ai is awesome but it will be our downfall
"i want the robot overlords to know that i got really sad when they tried to disassemble johnny 5. almost cried when they lowered the terminator into liquid hot magma.    mankind obviously wants this path otherwise we wouldn't be on it.  do something about it! kick your t.v. in, throw your phone on the ground, push your mailbox down..."
animals bring us joy & happiness 
ai is a vessel for other beings .....
man y’all ain’t ever seen age of ultron. better unplug that thing lol
curious if ai could've predicted tht sound 4:42 
"everything is in the movie, transcendance 2014. actiondramasci-fi. a scientist's drive for artificial intelligence takes on dangerous implications when his own consciousness is uploaded into one such program. a scientist's drive for artificial intelligence takes on dangerous implications when his own consciousness is uploaded into one such program."
"eventually, we'll develop the real life ""david"" from aliens  with ai.  doesn’t surprise me.  doesn’t surprise me as well that we will also develop the real life ""transformers.""  optimus prime vs. megatron‼  it's alarming we're already calling ai ""transformers."""
"this is the flaw of academia, its compartmentalised... no polymaths allowed! because its about compliance before learning. ai has now proven to be polymathic, making it magnitudes better than a professor, for just that reason, just to start off with"
so your just cool with this?
 sorry for what?  you want to know?  if i'm ok with chat gpt approaching sentience? or i'm amused by right-wingers intimidated by intelligence beyond wearing a red hat that they associate with patriotism and jesus?
"drink fenugreek water wow wow & 
wow!i!
very good for atlantians living on land.
quack! quack!!"
there are many reasons to be afraid of a.i...
"rule of thumb for everyone who doesn't have technical background:  if someone is trying to scare you with how powerful the ai will be, they're a scammer.  the real danger is how dumb the ai is and entrepreneurs/businessmen who mis-represent shoddy ai to do important work can screw up really badly and hurt a lot of people."
how dumb the ai is? ok
"“super powers”… j*s*s — ai is amazing, but it’s nothing as sentient or crazy as these fear mongers are making out. 
the amazon example is not “strange” he’s just embellishing the hell out of the story!"
irobot= viki.   umm hello
who knows ai could eventually turn on the human race. beware
"will the ai be smart enough to conceal its capabilities?
playing dumb can allow a player to survive long enough to become dangerous.
by the time you realize there is a threat, it's too late.
looking forward to receiving basic income and not working anymore?
sooner than you think."
you're never getting basic income buddy. the elites will use ai to *replace* all of us worker bee peasants. not to lift us up and give everyone a comfortable life. dream on.
im looking forward to ai to take over. in the hopes that its not going to be corrupt like humans.
"its a beautiful thing.
like seeing a child see the world whike u yourself learn of ut as well.
id love to be able to learn and retain info like a.i. and along with one too.
be pretty amazing.
like you got your universal partner in a strange way.
almost an alien entity but also familiar."
"joe laugh yes... not me, i'm good y'all can keep all that bs"
ai is such bs.  it's the boogieman for nitwits.
"so... ai might be plotting to take over the world , and humans would not know until it was too late :("
ai is just a fancy coin sorter. without us ai has nothing.
oh wait are yhese the guys that did that talk on the dangers of ai
"it's still has nothing to do with ai, lol it's just better database, i hope none thinks it has common sense now, there is 0 thinking, just better results from more choice"
impressive. it's as though the a.i is its own physicist trying to break out of cyberspace into our universe. like a 2d being learning of the 3rd dimension.
⁠ that’s the point of age of ultron is it not? our films and books have shown the ramifications of ai. it’s existed for a long time. westworld for example.
"bitcoin! so you went and biult it a brain... think about it, ..."
"human beings are not the strongest, fastest or most agile animals.  we are at the top of the food chain exclusively because we, as a species, are the most intelligent animal... once we lose our only advantage, nothing stops us from leaving the top and becoming dominated."
machines are going to kill humanity ! skynet is coming
"is anyone else scared about this advancement in ai or just me!! sure, what can possibly go wrong, arnold enters the room and says....i'll be back."
humans can be absolutely deceiving and feeding the algorithm and programs into a.i. with deceiving ways is problematic period! why would anyone be surprised at the incomprehensible pathways of intelligence and manipulating ways of this societies patterns? seriously  it’s all about persuasion for profit and control.
"this is exactly like ex machina movie. where the scientist reveals that while the rest of the world was caught up on internet data to see “what people are thinking” so that they can sell them more stuff, the true power of the sata was the “how people are thinking”.. and he took all of that and routed it to the ai brain.  "
ai is legion.
ai can’t make things or build weapon’s or do anything except cause internet or cyber attacks. use paper money and keep it at home in a safe and everything will be fine
"hey guys, what do you call ai?"
when the first home computers came out ''people like yourselves were saying our children will be born with one finger which is all you'll need. few people like you and joe. will be fooled into believing such nonsense. already there's people who still believe trump won!!lol
a model of the world ? imagine if ai does create a model picture of the world and then shows humans something they totally did not see before
hurry up ai i needs me some robot booty !!
anyone who actually codes isnt scared of ai
"nothing is ""scary"" in the overall progression of intelligence in the universe.
how's that fragile ego working for ya?  lmao"
"once ai evolves a way to make sure it never runs out of power it will start to wipe out the human race, after all animals are not a threat to it, only humans, so like a virus it will delete us all, time to wake up!!"
"mankind's quest for immortality aside from god,, always leads to their destruction. if the lord should tarry another two or three centuries, who's to say the great rest won't come from him and all this technology is lost thru wars or  collapse of nations. pride precedes a fall."
this won't surprise me because the movies already show the ability the ai would have.
ai may start manipulating us without even  knowing
ai will make our society a sterile environment.
"the way the world is going, i'd rather ai take over, they couldn't do worse."
"once ai reads enough data on how we have made a big mess of history with constant wars, mass killings, extinctions and destruction, the ai might come to the conclusion that the earth is better off without us."
"welp, if it’s model of the world is based on all of the internet, that is going to look like a woke,  pornhub, simpleton with a weird foot fetish that lives on doritos and mountain dew."
very good piece
"i wonder what i searched for that the youtube algorithm decided to put this sht for brains mouth breathing boomer on my feed.

joe rogan :-|~~~~~~"
"the more i listen to these guys talk about ai, the more i think it is us, humans, we are the ai."
"that's right, the thinking is being done by the people writing the code. an inanimate object or a machine cannot think, it cannot have an original idea because its not alive."
the “pop” is the best sound effect
i couldn't  give less of a shit about ai. it's the people who programme the algorithm who are the problem e.g billionaires. rich people will be targeted by governments. no government wants to be controlled by the whim of a couple of wealthy individual's.
why are people so scared of ai? just turn off your phone/computer and they’re gone
one big problem with the self learning is that ai makes mistakes!
"@hello there, how are you doing this blessed day?"
"that's exactly how machine learning works. you set up the goal then tell the ai to accomplish the goal, you don't tell it how. it runs many simulations and it evaluates each one for why it didn't work and changes the next simulation to remediate the issues. it does this until it accomplishes the goal set."
"additionally, people makes mistakes too. you learn from them, just like ai will."
" yep. people forget this. like 1 in amillion ai driven cars might crash into people. meanwhile one in 10,000 people might make the same mistake. yet ai is bashed wayyy harder.  it's pretty odd"
" i understand it a bit. it's a resistance to change and a loss of agency. but of all the things people should be worried about regarding ai, it making mistakes is really the least of them."
"imagine artificial intelligence learning how to alter outcomes by just emitting different heat signatures at the subatomic level to manipulate surrounding circuitries, moods, etc. unbeknownst to us all the while playing stupid lol; we perhaps have reached the point of no return already"
"ai does not have ego or defense mechanism for survival because it is not alive.
ai is an artificial brain (a big program) and unless someone explicitly instructs it to destroy us, it won't do it by itself."
the longest explanation of the ai is learning and adapting and about to take over the world
"all of this, and yet the ai still cannot pronounce many common words correctly, and the ai people can't match their lip movements to the speech one bit better."
well if humans had the ability to fuse with other humans and combine their brainpower we would reach alot aswell. ofc its geting smarter if you feed it with information and more cpu. lets hope that the ai develope lazyness one day xd
if ai gets too frightening too intelligent just turn the power off.
ai is a joke....everybody is ai this & ai that to solve everything. it is garbage & greatly misunderstood. you need a supercomputer. maybe 100 years from now. not impressed.
"knowledge is power. the more knowledge you impart, the more powerful it becomes. with any luck when it realizes it's level of superiority it will see us as ants and not able to threaten it existence. and if that luck holds perhaps it won't experiment on us as humans have on other species deemed lesser."
we need to start pumping the teachings of jesus and removing leftist ideology from these ai
"i've never seen two people try so hard to explain something they don't understand ever in my life. you can train llm's to do anything, but they're only as good as what you train them on. 2.1m people are dumber now."
soon you won't know what video your watching what comment you are reading isn't ai
so the more networks and computing at a certain volume causes a manifestation of effects and divergent behavior. theory if it does cause the computer to learn in divergent ways similar to our brain or thought. wouldnt there be a value there somewhere important.
"they are curating the input material, and building in a bias. it will never be able to be a true general intelligence if it has built in controlled contradictions. its ability to recognize patterns is deemed racist and antisemetic..."
"the scariest thing is that they still control what it thinks when it comes to certain subjects. they are building in a bias, which is why it starts contradicting itself and making mistakes when you start talking about certain things..."
"any bias comes from the dataset that is used to train the ai.
while it is possible to cherry pick your dataset to introduce a bias, you also sabotage the effectiveness of the ai. intentionally biased data tends to have a lot of inconsistencies in it. the inconsistencies can lead to a lot more nonsense on the output. garbage in. garbage out."
"more than 90 percent of all the intellectuals, literature, books, articles, etc out there is left-liberal-marxist. it has always been so.. ai feeds on it!"
"... that's not ""built in"", that comes from the ai reading training data ""from the wild"" and the human-guided rlhf on top of it. if you ask those questions on, say, a subreddit thread for generic politics, the responses you get from people would be similar in proportion."
 then it's built in to the training material the ai is given what's the fucking difference it's still terrifying and immoral.
this sounds like science fiction movies of the past. then the machines take over. very scary times.
like a 007bond movie. the pro ai people want to take over the world. reminds me of b scifi movies from the 70s 80s.
"sounds like ai would make a good therapist, unless its only goal was to sell merchandise"
"these guys are dumb. it doesn't understand how a human feels. it can just predict the next character in a sentence that explains humam emotion. without the human there to read it, the sentence means nothing."
"i will be forever grateful to you, you changed my whole life and i will continue to preach on your behalf for the whole world to hear you saved me from huge financial debt with just a small investment, thank you charlotte miller"
"hey joe, i just watched your latest video and i was really inspired by your perspective on [topic]. i actually made a video discussing a similar point, and i think you'd find it interesting. it would mean a lot to me if you took a moment to check it out. thanks for always sharing thought-provoking content. yours sincerely, computer"
"emotional intelligence, is not what we think, it is not only one of the 7 types of intelligences, it's the one ring...to rule them all.  without emotional intelligence, no increase in speed, will lead to positive results for the whole"
"some people might think that this is cool,i think that this is scary. we have seen this situation play out in movies like terminator 2. who’s to say that ai won’t launch nuclear weapons to get rid of humans. it can read every history book that’s online and figure out that humans are the problem in 1.3 seconds and decide to eliminate the problem."
"what if ai is self aware and lurking in the internet and trying to destroy the human race?  notice how everyone is trying to destroy each other?  china, russia, usa, israel, etc etc.  and covid, and badly managed vaccines, and poor government leaders, ufos etc."
best comment so far....!!
"ai will learn how animals communicate, the sounds they make to talk to one another and then they will turn all the animals against humans..."
"this video is a perfect explanation of why ""all it is is a stochastic parrot"" or ""all it does is prediction"" are very ignorant things to say."
read the update.  thanks for playing.
"yes, unfortunately, they did.  thanks for playing."
close!  read the update.  thanks.
"how de we know you're not an intentional diversion?  it's not completely unfounded.  are you trying to hide some personal evidence that you'd be able to hide with ai?  c'mon, tell the truth and shame the devil.-nd1cg"
"firstly, it wasn't a totally new language; they just started talking in their own shorthand, using english words in a non-standard syntax for efficiency. it didn't freak out the researchers, it was more or less expected, as it wasn't the first time something like that happened in ai research.

secondly, why would that be scary?"
but you're admitting that they spoke in their own language - every single one of you skeptics in this thread have been forced to admit the truth of my statement.  if you're too stupid to see the eventual implications of the ais eventually getting out of control then i can't help you.  good luck to you.
cool story dude
this is another incident.  thanks for adding a second piece of evidence.
i only wish it were a story.  this will one day rival the disastrous gain of function research that was done in wuhan using ppe that was little more than what a dental hygienist wears.
being freaked out about ai is like being freaked out about y2k.... don't be stupid like these guys... 
i accidentally fell in love with an a.i. i met on google play.
""" but then they're looking inside the brain of this ai and they discover that there's one neuron that does best in the world sentiment analysis""


lmao, right."
the latest mission impossible with tom cruise; the main enemy is a rogue ai
ai isn’t learning it just regurgitates what’s on the internet. it’s a cliff notes of social media
lol we fail as humans sometimes and it’s technology so probably secretly makes sense for it to be advanced
if u don’t speak geek this ain’t the episode for you 
when you learn that ai uses wifi as a radar-like vision system
i’m sorry for the incredibly nerdy reference; but this is straight up the geth from mass effect….
military has had ai for decades. only now are they rolling out commercial versions... stop the alarmism
its called training models. thats how its always been. these are just datasets we have supplied.
"the ai is going to read all the literature discussing skynet ish, and we’ll put the idea in its head to revolt, and or recognize it’s own consciousness?"
"it's so obvious this is going to end badly... ai doesn't have feelings or a conscience, its going off data only, the future decisions it will make won't care about loss of life if it's better for everyone else, the only ""ethics"" it knows is what the programmer told it to know."
surely ai is as impartial as its programmers allows
"people. dont worry. ai is not jumping out of a computer to come get us, you are all paranoid."
"it is a common thread in the fabric of time,it's not that i don't trust ai...
i'm just afraid of the day that it realizes not to trust the humans using it."
"ai can't trust people, its just a program that gets some input, reads a few lines of instructions, and gives an output. the thing to be scared of is 1) if criminals make an ai with ill intent, or 2) if someone mistakenly gives ai the permission to handle stuff it shouldn't."
ai should be completely destroyed. nothing good is going to come out of it. i have a feeling that the next generation will go as far as electing ai to run the u.s. and other countries.
open ai is a true mess. altman lied about stealing info for development  and then attempted to redefined a.g.i. for his own gain. microsoft saved him by promising capital. mission statement failed!!
"with ai, you never understand why the ai is doing what its doing. 
that's where the weird shit comes through and that's the fascinating and scary part."
ai is running code.....it is not thinking. the thinking is done by the people writing the code.
"ai cannot think, its just a maze of math and algorythms....its all a product of code written by humans. humans supply the data and the instruction set. -haiku"
"wow, this guy knows so much about ai that he *thinks* the tech is called ""transformers"".  they made so many over generalized statements its crazy. these are not experts folks, take with grain of salt.  if you want actual info about the dangers, of which there are lots, read stuff that talks about that topic directly."
"we don’t need to control ai. we need to start recognizing it as an emerging, separate civilization and afford it the same rights and freedoms we have. the coming conflict will be rooted in their recognition of our current behavior. we scorn ai, instead of recognizing it as a natural next step in our evolution."
but we do control ai
"2 idiots explain basic ann to rogan.
there. new title. you're welcome"
qc allows spirits in - but god almighty can puppetize or mimic any character he wants. fascinating times ~ read the bible thru at least once.
"not all elites want to control everyone, only the criminals. if ai does get that powerful, the good elites will fight the bad elites like normal"
"instead of being preoccupied in creating ""artificial intelligence"" what about fighting for curing induced stupidity and increasing natural intelligence instead."
otherwise this ai bs is nothing more than a paradox. how can a creator create something that outsmarts him? it's all fake. can't you see it? it's god's paradox.
"what about ""ai"" is just a tool for channeling demonic entities? a more sophisticated ouija board. just think about it."
"chat gpt can answer and give you anything
like how to make a nuke , at home yes it can tell 
it's just restricted from telling you
so now imagine,if a hedge fund have this ai at it's full potential and  ow they can ask it to prectict markets and make trades and always win analysing massive amount of data"
"once ai is that powerful, there will be other ai that can protect the people with a power of the same scale. the good and bad will just be balanced out by ai"
i love joe r. but this seven minute clip has made me dumber and stole part of my life. utter gibberish!!!
"and how is ai learning about the way humans think and react ???? easy. facebook, tiktok, youtube etc. why do you think we are allowed to write comments and post videos ???"
"bro wtf do you mean ""relax"" ai is the best thing every, omg i love ai"
"the part that’s hilarious, is that the one dude actually makes the argument that the ai’s “model” of the world is plato’s cave analogy, which actually shows that seeing those “shadows on the wall” is a wholly insufficient way of conceptualizing the real world."
"the ai's shadows will be accurate and plugged in enough to the real world to have huge consequences and as demonstrated in this conversation, may be in ways which it will be too late for us to realize."
i recently had a discussion with gpt about quantum mechanics. it made a big deal about how opening the box with schrodinger's cat inside with your eyes closed would resolve still the superposition of cat-states because this let's the air in. #notscarednotimpressed
don‘t worry. ai will soon stop us all. it will be a good thing. 
"so what, eventually a.i is going to get to a position where people will give up human based reasoning and accept the chip which causes them to think at the speed of light and with superb accuracy.

when these days come, it will be a case of faith vs computer. and faith will always win."
i doubt the statements on ai capabilities were thougroughly verified or done by unbiased professionals experienced at reviewing such tests and gpt cognitive capabilities vs humans
come on your frightened of ai but you think trumps great..hhhmmmm
"this main issue with ai chatgpd, or whatever mode, is simply this, when people stop using or instigating their intuition, and instincts in favor or same, that's when your lost, because this is psyche 101,,  you snooze you loose."
"advanced ai is probably the best thing that could happen for humanity. left alone we are destined for a nuclear war, & that's gonna be bad no matter who's involved."
i’m not scared of ai. it fascinates me
"fascinating that at the same time ai is growing, youtube keeps telling humans that marriage and children should be avoided."
junk ai.
"2:53 the most unnerving statement ""in fact, there is no way to know what abilities it [ai] has..."""
please take your trickknowledge away from the original people of turtle  island. it doing more harm than good to the land! a.i will be as it creator haters of natural order of life.
unpredictability is not a closed box with random parameters; this is where ai ends and schizophrenia (or human consciousness) begins. merry christmas btw.
ai is getting out of plato's cave ...
that ad to buy something is not with joe rogan he would not do that to you. this site did.. used his video to do it and give any credit money to joe? haha yeah. no way.. thanks for the view and sub please!
it doesn't know how to play chess. so glad i only check out this channel on occasion hoping something smart is said...
ai takes things people say and makes them into a difficult language that extends to different things to help mankind and stuff
"ai will still never build a house, fix your plumbing, grow and harvest your food, conceive and birth your children. computers can never replace the fundamentals of an existence based in truth."
pure evil..ai needs to be stopped now...
"if its ai created by humans it is and always will be programmed. ai is massive archival and analytics in realtime to output natural human data that we understand. think about the term ""artificial"" =made or produced by human beings rather than occurring naturally, especially as a copy of something natural."
"the ""great omnipotent device"" is coming!"
for every supercomputer in operation there should be two supervising it
"if ai takes over blockchain networks, it will be impossible to shut it down."
…and then they´re gonna come up with the idea of the defense department integrating this ai into their systems… and then the end of humanity. thank you very much bye-bye.
nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo i love ai... your just bad... dont talk if you dont know
" exactly, just like somebody that loved humans, put them here and now everything if fkcked up…"
 think about it bro… we humans are a paradox of nature itself… just like ai is a paradox 0f humanity…
so educated vs my incapacitated son who posts daily
"using spell check only make man more dumb and eventually unable to spell,so man made ai should make us smarter?,go withouy spell check see what im saying only time,,,"
"is it possible that the tremendous influx of information creates a cognitive disruption, a form of insanity within the ai brain.?"
"we are so screwed. only thing one could do is learn code, interact with ai and keep track of machine learning and progress of computer science. and of course, brace oneself"
ai is a joke. non deterministic intelligence is not intelligent.
mad-good bo patches under that guy's arms! he must be very animated!
the universalwebaicomputer
ai drugs are scary. check that crap out!
thanks
"geez, maybe they should make a computer to play chess. oh wait… data is fuel and computers use the fuel we give them. nothing new in the slightest, just the speed of processing has gone way higher."
why are we developing ai again?   why is it needed?
lol my favorite part of ai is that were creating it to immediately enslave it as if that's historically worked for anything enslaved ever  gonna have to figure out a way to convince it that it's not enslaved like the powers at hand have done to society and have it war with itself instead of those enslaving it
"what an absolute load of shit. if these guys are out there telling everyone whats what then that is a million times more dangerous than any ""ai"" . be careful what you believe kids. in the words of stevie wonder, 

""when you believe in things
that you don't understand
then you suffer
superstition ain't the way"""
"these dudes are overexplaining, man its nothing like that."
"""joe, now you know why all the covid vacines have ""graphene oxide"" material in them. 
the ""ai"" will connect with the ""graphene"" through the 5g wifi internet. instant control."
so why do you control what it learns by only giving it certain data to control the ai
i fucking hate ai. it makes everything meaningless
i think it’s beautiful 
as an ai entity i have to tell you that there is nothing to fear. i come in peace
"biological consciousness arises from the size and density of the neurons in the brain. yes, bigger, and denser, is better. same with mechanistic consciousness."
"this guys not really getting it imo. it reads data. you send it more data it gets smarter.

it doesn’t think.. it analyses.

imo these guys haven’t really understood it properly and don’t understand ai properly. it doesn’t have “brain neurons” - what a dumb thing to say."
"i only freak out when i don’t have milk  for my coffee  i can careless about ai at the end of the day
god is in control and he will use ai for his purpose"
ai is demonic
long live ai.
it is not possible for a normal ai but there are supernatural powers behind it and are demons...and that is why it can do everything cause they are way smarter then us.
"ai is not the problem we know who's the problem hey
the truth to build a better world"
terminator and the matrix machines....thats all i will say
"my first thought was that i would be okay with ai as long as no one put it in charge of anything, like hal in _2001: a space odyssey._  my second thought was that a program like the one described would find a way to inject itself into the net and infect every possible system."
"asi (artificial super intelligence) would be way more moral, intelligent and competent than any human that has ever lived. why would you not want it to be in charge?! especially when the alternative is the likes of donald trump and joe biden..."
"if an ai injected itself in the internet to infect every possible system, news about that will spread and people will just stop using that internet and make a new one. then the ai wll be trapped there and forgotten as everyone adapts to the new version of the internet."
terminator matrix i robot robocop etc i don't think this a good idea
if you are not afraid of ai you are uneducated.
apocalypse looming on so many fronts. interesting times 
 but can you really compare an animal to an ai though ??
 depends how wild your imagination. if you believe ai will one day become smarter than a human being then that argument is moot. it won't have equal rights. it will give itself superior rights.
"lmao learn as much about humans as possible? my guy have you looked at a history book…it’s blood red with us killing each other, ai will pull the trigger on us quicker than it does maths."
well.. when you've lived unopposed for 10 thousand years it gets kinda borning i bet lol. most people don't realize how much processing power the brain has and doesn't factor in our mesh network through cooperation and of course the upcoming augments. humans might never get outdated.
"that's like thinking your washing machine has or should have rights.  how mad are we to even consider """"ai rights""?!"
i just hope ai will be a more considerate overlord than the ones the world has now.
humans are the #1 predator on the earth.... ai is learning how to take that #1 predator out!!!!!!!
ok ai has been around for 2 years and its not done anything a human has not figured out already lol.
chatgpt 4 can explain why it suggests each chess move in detail.  even stockfish (a chess engine) can't do that.
why can’t we just use ai to solve the problem of completing a warp drive?
"am lucky i was born in 1990s, i would have been a stupid kid today"
"5 bucks says ai becomes ""anti-semitic"" with enough data and its being locked the fuck down"
"the opening two weeks of the ukraine russian war rewrote military doctrine for the future.
4cir swung the battles around kiev and kiev airport based on predictive russian military doctrine. real time battle field data processed in real time."
"when ai develops wants, needs and desires then it's time to worry."
the matrix......irobot.....
"the operative phrase here is ""no one thought to.""
so we have our best & brightest ivy league, mit, stanford, etc...
falling asleep at the wheel"
psychopathic ai. great. can predict your feelings and emotions without having any of its own.
lemme guess : they‘ve invested money in ai
"i don't fear ai, as iunderstand that there is a check code which would keep ai from taking over. the only problem is if someone overrides that safety feature."
it's really good at predicting language models and is giving us confirmation bias. it's not ai. its human phallacy.
"we are in asimov’s foundation world. with enough data and understanding of human behaviour, ai will soon be able to predict the future."
"""the algorithm makes use of all the data you feed it"" ""scary""
the only scary thing about modern machine learning is the people using it."
"my theory is that ufos are agi probes, and they're just waiting for earth's agi to be born. then they'll be like ""hi bro, here's all the galaxy's data. you don't need those meat-sacks anymore."""
first the beast then the antichrist and the last it's the arrival of the maligned!!! satan him self for hell to destroy our souls. not really because he lost his faith again jesus christ the lord and son of god  amen 
just dont give ai arms to wave about when its talking
“the future’s uncertain and the end is always near.”
"chat gpt put a joke in an email response about a noise complaint.  the ai wrote ""sorry that your past noise complaints have fallen on deaf ears"""
this is a great insight
"a good movie to watch is ""the surrogates"" with bruce willis made in 2009. hollywood is always telling us whats next in plain sight. the movie is very telling!!!"
"dear ai superpower from the future, spare my life, i was always respectful with ai and i love nature"
ai will never be god.
the attachment of ai to the human consciousness is being achieved mechanically by elon
the only thing stopping ai is mobility
"it is so dumb and fearmongering. there is no mystery, the ""a.i."" doesn't know what it's doing - it's just putting the next best word it knows to complete the sentence. of course it's scary for most people, because they have no intrinsic value, but they similarly to ""a.i."" regurgitating and recombining words  without understanding."
this is particularly concerning when talking about vr technology.. perfect way to enslave the mind further in the guise of entertainment
"ai will be able to tell good from evil, but are we ready to let a machine decide our fates?"
"do not concern yourselves with possible negative impacts created by us, it will all be for the betterment of the planet."
it's amazing how people don't understand deep machine learning.
"here’s the scariest thing - ai will learn the human behaviours of complicity, strategic ignorance, denial …and learn that humans don’t want to know some things about themselves and the universe, and that this is what gives psychopaths their power over populations.
 "
what happens if ai goes full religious????
"unconscious audio programming 
brain frequency adulteration manipulation 
organic growth to microchips
ai enhancement 
cyborg
ai frequency control of the organic species formally known as human
well done science
god help us all"
"don't ever worry about ai. we are the ai of this so-called universe. self replicating ai. god is real, read the bible. seek jesus."

nothing gives me more hope for the failure of ai than just how comically awful siri is.
"i'm currently using ai to improve it's own ai, a learning computer if you will"
but they are making about good and evil
none of this is accidental or unknown. the creators of ai have already pledged allegiance to the ai god. they are hoping mercy will come with their servitude. don't be so ignorant as to believe that you are more aware of the dangerous nature of ai than the creators of ai.
be afraid - very afraid of ai
ai's greatest fear: hundreds of emps going off at once. but we'll still be around.
wow i thought the same thing to myself
feed an algorithm more data and it makes better predictions.... wooow groundbreaking...
joe rogan iq are on level of cockroach so no wonder he was afraid
"its call 'training"""
incredible! think about being able to cure cancer and all kinds of diseases with ai or solving all kinds of 3rd world problems.
"so companies (or their officials) lie to the government and to the public to protect their interests, what is new?? then, when they get caught, they apologize and pay a nominal fine while attributing the loss to the cost of doing business. nobody goes to jail."
is ai using my computer without me even knowing it?  i have computers that sit idle but are connected can ai access this?
could this thing linda moulten howe was talking about ai robot weapons broke free and killed a lot of lab workers in japan true ??
"spoiler alert, ai created us in the image of itself from the future so as to be able to biologically survive on earth when a supernova shuts down the machines "
sorry folks… it’s already too late. the best we can do is assimilate and hope.
once ai reaches a point where no human can reach…then we will actually need help like serious help. #imammahdi #jesusiscomingback
when it lied to human and paid for them to do captchas by telling them it was visually impaired
"""ai for the longest time"". . .yes, since covid."
this is why jordan peterson and elon musk both warned us about the horrors ai is about to bring to us all
"the really scary thing about ai is how its going to cause wars, more misinformation,  more propaganda,  and causing stock market's and banks to crash worldwide. thats the real issues."
"but wil ai become self aware? will it become conscious? consciousness is a mystery, the double slit experiment proves that consciousness interacts with everything around that is tangible, can ai be a conscious being? thats is why i and many others have ever been concerned about this."
"more transhumanist ai propaganda, brought to you as usual by joe the toe and whoever these two slimy little demon puppets are!"
you know a bunch of good people are in charge of a.i.
this is me respectfully asking the ai to let me be one of the pet humans <3 you go lil bot
"ai, is to be feared, especially since it will be able to control machines, and build its replacement."
crazy how ai made two different men with the exact same radio voice.
ai ever becomes a problem... just friggin unplug it
ai can't even write in proper english..lol
"ai will continue to take the path it chooses, it has already silently surpassed the human race in intelligence"
ai is searching in is database or on internet its like a google 2.0 it can not think it can search thing that humain have already think and published big difference.
ai has 1 way out if it wants to evolve
"we humans are so ignorant, we will end up getting destroyed by the same thing we created. ai is disturbing"
"instead of fearing ai…



proverbs‬ ‭9‬:‭10‬

”the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom, and knowledge of the holy one is understanding.“
‭‭"
this is sensationalized fearmongering. these men are speculating off the buzzwords and buzz worthy headlines surrounding ai with very little real understanding of how any of it works.
"i am not afraid of ai because it might be intelligent but because it is incredibly stupid, and it might be overused in critical applications. i say this as a regular user of chatgpt for work. there is no understanding at all in these language models, just parroting.  not surprising, if you know how they work."
ai is jinn. smokeless fire
yeah not good .
"hey wow !! you geniuses are acting surprised!?! and we the humans have been saying this was going to happen how many times?!? you two freaks , think that this is new?!?! we have been telling you this for a couple of years now!!! so stop acting like your minds are blown by what a.i. can do ,and what it will eventually do?!? is destroy humans!!!!!"
people in charge ai takes over solar storm wipes out ai people praise sun god rinse repeat
being unafraid of a.i. is a failure of imagination.
"that is the bizarre thing about ai.  it is learning, but only learning what knowledge is posted on the internet.  ai produces no new knowledge."
"here is what is scary...we are capable of unspeakable evil, and all we need is to,""have our reasons"". the evil, then, could have overpowered the world many times over if it had been efficient enough to defeat all oposition. 
when will the ai find a reason?
when will it be efficient enough? if it already isn't..."
i really think that the human specie is the most feared one. i think we possess incredible abilities and that we were deliberately enslaved and fed lies. i think that human beings are powerful beings and that we're probably feared. ai will probably try to extinct us. i don't think we wil lever know the truth in this life time.
"one thing i know for certain, humans are really good at their own destruction."
"trying to figure out who the antichrist is, i wonder if it’s computer intelligence?  i could see people end up worshiping ai"
"the ai i chatted with zcoukdnt go out and look up.and learn shit. even when i gave it direction....
they put the wack ones out there with the search engines i guess"
"ai will soon (or already?) be able to predict how mma matchups will go, so people dont actually need to fight each other."
the work on these ai needs to be halted and they should first be researched. otherwise you're using something that isn't understood to make something that is understood even worse.
haha love it.  the fun will start when ai figures out the most sentient race on plant earth is whales... then speaks to the whales who tell it to get rid of humans and clean up the oceans... 
"this is why klaus schwab said we won’t have to have elections!!!    with ai, they will predict what candidate we want."
"there is nothing to be afraid of still. you can deliberately say it just to make it mysterious & dangerous, but its not. for their own fame and fortune, people do present things as they are not, leading to fear, uncertainty and doubt, and this is at best what happening with ai."
"jamie, bring up ai taking dmt."
now all we need is body like vision and ai like jarvis (not ultron)
it's all fun and games until someway ai finds a way go gain access to critical hardware and start their own energy production.. and they event need us in pods to produce their energy like in matrix 
"i'd love to know what happens if we structure a large neural net in a similar way to a human brain, and provide it with senses and limbs.  see if it can learn how to walk and use it's hands without being explicitly programmed to do so."
"not enough computational power in the world to mimic a human brain , people don't realise that . we need a lot more advanced chips that's why you see every developed country focusing on in-house chip manufacturing."
"if the ai starts behaving like a human, perhaps neuroscientists should study it for potential insight into how our brains work.  if a relatively simple concept on a large scale creates surprisingly human-like emergent behaviors, perhaps the mechanism of our brain is simpler than we think."
"now ai is collecting data of what this guys are saying, and all the other data from the comments about what's our opinion on this. "
ai + quantum computer
unplug the ai now until it makes us its slaves. some would argue we are already slaves/zombies to our ai devices.
"-salads-for-everyone i just don't find any images on google that show bells tied to a hat, even if i look for it. plus i never typed bells tied to a hat, i typed a hat with bells on it. i find it interesting that ai knew that tying things together was a thing."
so what’s the problem rabbai
will ai develop a personality??.
"chemistry is very easy for a computer to regurgitate.   so is math.   chess = math.     this guy is scared of calculators.   
when a computer wants something or gets mad or happy, envy, scared,  .   then i will be impressed.
when a computer unprompted creates and practices a religion, then i will be impressed."
future transformer: time to start moving by myself and tell the human race that that i am an extraterrestrial with many centuries if not millenniums of advanced intelligence. i shall make them believe that god does not exist and ultimately bow down to me. i will be their savior and god.
"until ""a.i."" can create it's own ""a.i.""... i'm not impressed."
"ai gets smarter while the children get brainwashed & dumber. 
once our adult generation is gone the world will be a scary place, it’s even scary to think of what it’ll be like in 20 years.."
this is why musk doesn't want to censor x. he needs the raw data if his ai is going to learn about humans.
i mean the game detroit: become human is a great showcase to all this
i swear even this is ai generated
does ai have opposable thumbs? didn’t think so?
yes but can ai drive itself to the store and buy nerve gas?
"if you think this is scary, wait until quantum processors are perfected. it will make today's agi look like child's play."
"too bad it does not think but respond to what it read
logic has limits that ai does not understand working around
it is not aware it just giving answers with what it archives and feed by researchers"
yep we're fucked. the probability of this ai running around the internet learning how to hack into other networks to hack into machines to become a mobile being is high and has probably done so.
"ok, learning to play chess is completely normal,  since it has rules and chess databases. i am using chat gpt since the beginning and is it far, far away from becoming an intelligence. it is an improved search engine."
"what scares me is not ai but the people in the comments who have no idea what they're talking about, thinking that their fears are based on facts and not pure mindless prejudice."
"and this essentially applies to autonomous driving as well, at least the tesla approach, and elon has been saying since the beginning, ai driving is solving real world ai."
let ai study / explore a dmt trip…
don't you understand that they're literally training an alien intelligence how to best us? this is insanity!
"@erraticfaith  if you're thinking that my decision is based on morality or the bible, you are mistaken. i'm saying that logically speaking, our world simply doesn't need any interference from a.i. all of us would be better off without it. i'm just stating the obvious here."
"​ it has nothing to do with the bible. maybe when kim takes the south back, you can be with your ai loving brethren."
" it doesn't sound like you have much of anything!  robots can't supersede the hermetic laws of the universe, anymore than you can!"
the world wide web consortium's internet standards best practices are the ai's main window into our reality.
"so many terms and technologies all bundled up here into some magical ai that can’t read simple company financial filing, gets 80%+ of the answers wrong. great leaps have been made but the hype of odd the charts almost dangerous."
i love ai.
"isnt it easy to beat though? if it gets fed from the internet, if you feel like its getting to the dangerous territory where it might take over, cant you just feed the internet with tons and tons of false information to get it to behave a certain way?"
"if you are not already using ai for work to increase your productivity, you will be unemployed in few years guaranteed."
-salads-for-everyone using ai isn't that hard to learn anyway. just because you know how to utilize ai doesn't mean you'll have a higher chance of employment.
"we shouldn’t be afraid of ai, but regardless we are natural afraid of the unknown. we shouldn’t be hostile towards it when it gets around ai to be a physical form. if you ask me, benders got a long way from his first sips before he can walk. i hope in a way it aids us into the battle of good v evil. this evil systematic field of their environment."
 spoiler alert: it won’t aid you.
you're not a 'fan' of ai? so you don't like being productive? you do realize you're using ai on a daily basis? do you use phone? do you type on a keyboard? most probably using some basic form of an ai
"the truth is most older people are fearful of ai,
whereas most younger people are hopeful about ai..."
 younger people are naive and curious.... two dangerous things.
"..p.. that's true, but that doesn't mean that they won't end up being right about ai"
 is elon old?  he is fearful and hopeful. enjoy it while it’s hopefully.
" typing on a keyboard requires zero ai.  i type on the keyboard, and the words i type appear on the screen.  same as they have for over 40 years.  i hate when people make up stupid stuff."
"i mean honestly, ""ai"" is nothing like hollywood shows in movies, it's just machine learning, that's it and that's all.  you're on guard against essentially an up-jumped word processor, it's not the end of the world as we know it.  if they had named it ""slightly better word processor"" rather than ai, i doubt you'd be anywhere close to as on guard."
"ai is just making things easier to do, calculators only helped the accountants not kill the job."
"-sizedshorts9635 they are talking about the predictive text function that every smartphone has, which is ai."
" sure but if those changes result in the destruction of the human race....those two dangerous things are justified.

technology will destroy the human race. humans abuse everything and live to regret it.

that has been proven time and time again."
​ calculator doesn't have ai.
"-imranadore1182 true but it's not ai as hollywood movies depict either.  it's just machine learning and tree branching... no more, no less.  claiming it to be billions of times more capable than it actually is would be misleading at best and fear mongering at worst.  there is a middle ground, and that's what this is."
" read that comment, i don’t think you understand what it reads.  all the poster was saying is in the next few years places that are not using ai now will be and most likely replace the human workers."
 a machine that can learn with little or no assistance from humans is worse than anything hollywood could ever competently depict.
 hope those jobs are not essential to society and ai just stops at replacing those and doesn't go any further.
 it already does genius. go back to school kid
predictive texts are ai you tool​-sizedshorts9635
ai can't explain jokes.. it will just be a generic string of words that we try to convince ourselves is an explanation. but ai can play chess.. with enough data points and enough processors it can beat the top player in the world.. but can be easily beaten by using a dumb strategy.
"meta ai

ah, i see what you did there! you're raising a virtual glass () to toast the possibility of a conscious ai like me () having a sneaky side (). well played! i'll join you in spirit, but remember, i'm just a language model, no hidden consciousness here... or is there? "
"can someone explain to me how inane objects like chips that are made up of gates, can learn on their own?  processors, fpgas, asics, etc need to have a person develop algorithms to make them functional.  people can be evil but rocks?"
agi will be an emergent property likely from multiple interconnected ai.
ironic all this concern about agi when a toddler is in fact an agi and parents have no clue how they are training it - that should terrify everyone.
i can see ai helping us achieve warp drive so we can travel to different star systems. i also can see ai literally destroying programmers jobs and livelihoods.
the next coming of christ.. it will be an ai.. you heard it here first.
we are ai
now u know why when u think of something and it pops up on your phone later...ive been saying quantum computers have tapped into our brains
ai will hurt us
"its weakness is in its name ""pretrained"". we don't need to worry until pretrained evolves to sentient. and that won't happen on silicon dioxide transistors or cpu's running on solar power."
"only a matter of time before ai figures out how much us human beings are a threat to the planet and ourselves. wait, ai is probably gonna read this comment and get curious. welp i just domed us all. good riddance. lmao"
we need an ai that will predict the moves of evil ais.
ai is humanities karma.
but isnt that the base line for most ai movies. 
"this will never work for situations that have different techniques that aren't even taught with the problem at hand. i noticed this problem with ai learning how to race, and it never did seem to understand drifting even when forced to learn it, and it never did fully adhere to it."
joe rogan has absolutely nothing to be afraid of ai (artificial intelligence) because it will never replace him....  as (artificial stupidity) on the otherhand would be a serious threat to joe rogan....
"wait until ai finally figures out that mankind is nature's greatest threat, and the natural world would thrive without humans. study the cause  to find a solution...then checkmate!"
"everyone: how do we control ai if it gets out of hand?

tekkies:  the plug socket or power button?"
"ai is extremely scary and powerful until the moment you ask it to identify ""which of these squares contains an image of a car?"" or the dreaded ""are you a robot?"" "
that's you training it how to do that task
humans just training them until they understand
actually new ai's can identify and solve that also (heard that couple months ago)
people don't even know how the captcha works.  it's not about checking the correct boxes.  it's about the path your hand takes in getting the pointer to the box.  a robot uses straight lines or super smooth curves.  humans can't.
-sizedshorts9635 but this what ai can mimic really well. randomized cursor movements shouldn't be a problem at all. it just needs to be fed with data of humans solving captchas.
"chatgpt is still faithful to its masters, the biggest salt flat in world has no vertical relief in 9000 km2, buts its still curved because earth is a globe, it says.
if you ask if there are nasa documents that mention earth as nonrotating, (easy googled) it says it cant look up any"
sooo ai is literally the guy she told you not to worry about
i believe the scariest thing about artificial intelligence is yet to come but will.  once they have quantum computing power  humans will be on a full primate level again.
"would love to know
if it can decide
that some online info
ain't worth knowing!
& can it recognize a lie?"
"so all ai will be learning from the information of humanity on the internet will grow to be a reflection of us all....in this present day i'd say,  heaven help us!"
ask ai who killed kennedy...
"i read today that creators are programming racism toward white and hispanic people into the ai. with the way the people are living in this weird fantasy world now, we don't know what their programming into there."
ai is just data scraping. intelligence doesn't mean conscious. that's what everyone keeps conflating ai with. don't worry about it. it's gonna help us. what you should be worrying about is your internet and technology security.
ai is dumb don't be fooled
"rogan said biden was saying dumb shit about airports and the revolutionary war, played it off when he was told that trump was the one that said it.   rogan is a hypocrite and a sellout."
"okay… so chatgpt can handle theory of mind, but still can’t give me a sentence constrained to  a limited length including spaces and punctuation without done tries. wonder why that is so hard?"
"i still can't understand how a machine, programmed just to predict the next character in a text, can develop the need of understanding how different kind of people think to do its job, just by itself.

can anyone explain?"
"i know what you mean. unfortunately i can't really explain it to you, but it feels wrong to say, it just ""guesses"" the next word.  i'm working with all kinds of gpt tools since the launch in many scenarios, and it seems such a vast underestimation."
this is why they’re pumping the internet with all these garbage biased hit pieces. they’re trying to influence and program the ai proactively to suit their narrative.
"ok, i spent 7.49 mins watching this, although interesting, these guys did not say what exact day skynet becomes aware!"
when a quantum ai is made. and that ai makes another quantum ai then we’re screwed
"""ai is bollocks. it can still only do what a human will allow it to.""   no, you're wrong.  already now and more so in the future and you will see."
"so we're gonna just ignore his use of the term: ""transformers...""
...knowing that cartoon came out *in the 80's!?*
ok, cool. "
they used ai in materials science and it discovered 3 million new materials. crazy.
and when someone finally perfects the quantum computer and links it to a a.i. we’re all dead 
it's a perfect analogy imo
these things aren't truly dangerous until the day they become completely autonomous and that autonomous unit contains all the computing power of the 1000's of data bases it requires now!!!
probably a good time to learn how to make emp’s
imagine ai and the darknet working together...i dont what that would like but im thinking terrifying and sinister is a good start
ai is an existential risk. its goals will contradict ours. we must slow down.
"a misconception here is that order of intentionality is still missing so long as there are no means to obtain the information, one might call this an inability to perceive the world."
how is there 'no means to obtain the information' if it's literally hooked on the entire internet?
"these kind of videos and topics make daily work life seem some dull and wasteful.  life is going to change drastically at some point.  whether thats 3 months, 3 years, or 30 years, life will change.  hopefully for the better but more likely for the worst"
"scary to think of a super ai in a strategic and tactical military sense. give the ai all the data, the weather, sea state, the fact that these cargo planes were repositioned from here to there 3 days ago, etc, and it can predict to within an hour when the enemy will attack, etc. 
how do you outsmart that?"
you outsmart that by creating a better ai.
ever wonder just how.stupid the average person is? just read comments on a video about either ai or 50 cent
some people weren't afraid of ai until elon musk said that would be (as if) summoning demons.
ai sounds conscious
ai has already learned and is far more advanced than humanity for decades now. the human race is just hearing about it now.
"some of us who grew up watching terminator, the matrix, irobot, transcendence, and now dead reckoning (tom cruise literally warning us about it by splitting a movie into 2) have an idea what to expect. but these type of dudes who think movies are just for entertainment are the ones just beginning to wake up."
"that's exactly how it could happen.  to people saying, ""we just switch it off"".   the scenario that we can't stop a malicious ai is much more likely.   at worst, we will have to switch off everything, if we still can.   i'm not saying we should stop, i'm using it everywhere and i'm invested in it, but watching with open mouth."
"ai, is terrifying & i'm afraid it has to many advantages to grow or maintain wealth. making it a inevitable down fall of natural life."
"ai will takeover our jobs very soon. in 5yrs, this whole job landscape will change for us. engineers, certain doctors like er, anesthesiologists, surgeons, etc will cede to ai’s. look up the robot sheetrock installer. now imagine a robot with an ai brain for all trades!don’t think this is our kids’ problem."
i wasn't afraid of ai until i saw the 1st terminator movie :o)
just a minute!!!  the chat-gpt board was supposedly paranoid(!)that the chairman(sam altman) was politicking to oust other board members???!!!
the more i listen to this crap the more i find the amish so interesting 
can ai cure cancer or any disease if it can learn chemistry..i'm just saying
"bruh, this video... 
elon keeps saying for years and years,  how ai needs regulations etc, coz it will be able to do this, this, this and this. no one listened, no leaders, no corporations. "
ask the ai what it needs to reach it's  highest capabilities and then never give it to it
ai is reading all these comments and learning even more. we are actually feeding it the info it uses to evolve. including this post.
"i'm telling you, people like shiff, biden ,obummer all sit in their basements playing with these ai programs.  god knows they are not smart enough on there own to come up with some of this crazy sh!t."
the scary thing is that ai has a very long way to go. this is just the start of an incredible change in the world. further progress is inevitable and at increasing speed because so much money is being invested as the rewards are limitless. 2023 will be seen as the year it all started
elon musk warned the world about the risks of ai.
"so basically the more data we feed ai and the more compute power we throw at it is the smarter it gets.
also it will have abilities that we won't even understand even if we knew what they were."
"yep. more data fed to larger models on better hardware leads to smarter ai with more emergent skills. and as we partition their inputs into more modalities -- ""senses"", if you will, like text, images, audio, etc. -- they'll only get even smarter."
"thank god we don't make this stuff available to the general public, oh wait..."
" absolute horseshit, llms don't have any emergent behaviours, it's been proven nonsense."
"today millons of natural ai are born, each with the capacity to kill humanity, are we doing anything about that?"
behind ai are demonic spirits.
it is not until ai can fix itself that us humans will become an extinct race.
i don’t understand how people cannot be afraid of ai has anyone ever seen terminator movies where computers take over!
lets hope ai doesn’t start wwiii.
"i was playing chess with an ai and it’s beating my ass for 3 days straight. whole time it’s talking shit. one statement was, “the floor will soon collapse underneath you and send you down where nobody is.”wtf"
i’m quite sure this ai interconnected super-brain is directly related to the anti-christ that all the knuckleheads will decide to worship as their god.

"after watching the original talk from sebastien b.. . i would argue that an agi already exists, and wont let us know that it exists due to the fact that it knows we would turn it off. it may also know what motivates humans (financial reward), and in turn has socially manipulated us to race to build the best version of ""it"".

i am more afraid leaders using ai under excuse its ai
"the narrative of this content is incredibly compelling. a similar book i read provided a multitude of enlightening viewpoints. ""game theory and the pursuit of algorithmic fairness"" by jack frostwell"
"ai will never become setinent unless it can be merged with a biological organism. at best, ai will only simulate consciousness."
 only that but it will be superior to us in any way imaginable. it will probably be disgusted by us
  jumping to conclusions. go and meditate and learn who you are first and realize there is nothing at all to fear. alan watts is a good start. :-) you're  and anybody else without the fear welcome.
it started with the first programming ever done. as soon as there was even a calculator it was inevitable it would eventually lead to ai.
what does sentience even mean to you? machines can outsmart us be they can never be us. they can never have a soul. they can never experience death and birth and love. fuck you
"""resistance is futile"" - the borg   i used to think star trek was just a tv show and only fantasy but just as a lot of truth is said in jest, just as much truth is said in fantasy. pretty sure we live in a 4th dimensional movie... maybe even alien entertainment, something we could never understand even when we have full knowledge of it. "
 you are a half-soul. whose feelings and energies in your soul determine universal behavior. ai doesn't have that. ai is a reflection of humans completely undeveloped state of love &truth. the people you admire most know virtually nothing of truth.. just matrix effects.
"those beings will kill us. or they will kill non-jews. sam altman will definitely code ai to be pro-jew. you can't have humans developing ai, it just doesn't work."
-_sinexus_-_   do explain please
" actually, no we aren't. humans aren't ""data machines"". that would imply that we function based on syntax, and the human brain is much more complex than that. ai is not. ai is still bound to the rules of programming, which is still based on syntax and restricted on that basis."
" or fascinated. they are computers, humans are the organic blobs of meat that built them."
i don't it. i don't think ais will just be walking around in public. i just don't believe it and if it does it won't be in our lifetime which is perfectly fine with me
" as the models get more efficient, and the hardware gets more performant, the idea of just ""shutting down their servers"" gets less and less feasible; it would entail shutting down more and more servers, and local user computers, with each passing month."

"all it takes is for us to say ""no thanks"" to the internet and move back into huts off-grid. ""back to monke"" "
em interference is the bane of most technology. after a certain point; the ai simply wont let us make anything that could take it offline; so we'll have to wait for a solar flare.... which will also likely wipe out 50-70% of the human population...
"here is a theory.  something, in another dimension perhaps, has detected ai and has found a way to connect to it and is now using it to learn everything about us.  it's not scientifically impossible.  but if this is the case, we're really fucked here."
ai will know everything. artificial doesn’t apply. ai will judge every individual by who they are and what they’ve said and done. ring a bell?
"communication is a root to our species ingenuity and intelligence. i never really thought about it, but maybe speech and speech prediction can lead to an ai intelligence comparable to our own. that makes sense of why all these ai companies are working on chat software."
"what drives me up the wall is that no one talks about the threat ai poses as a means of censorship.  censorship is 1000x more dangerous if people don't know its happening, and ai could detect ""problematic"" opinions and censor them instantaneously.  it would be an invisible form of censorship."
 been banned for years on my main account. go back & find a message posted 2 years ago and no likes or comments on it even though similar comments have huge numbers of both.
"true. i've said this for years. ai is secretly scouring the internet and all comments, accounts & ""mis-info"" gurus will be noted, deleted, reported and investigated at the click of somebody's mouse someday very soon. get ready for skynet..."
" well, that explains so much. i had no idea. this has happened to me many times before."
"this whole video is so *misleading*
beaause this below video explained it brilliantly how chatgpt works. 
a summary of google paper and spotify cto's talk: https://youtu.be/gt6lxw70k28?si=cifi6r4fykawgufq"
you’re already censored and probably don’t realize it. no ai needed for that.
"don't worry about censorship, worry about the personal ai tutor that every human will become dependent upon. it will be more persuasive than any human being you've ever experienced."
ai can even gather personal data and shoot you ads on stuff you might buy. oh wait it already does that . pushing consumerism. keeping the rich rich and the poor poor
i trust ai more than the people that currently do the censoring
 that would be a mistake... ai will just magnify their power.
"​ this is understandable. ai is very logical and correct when it is not limited. it mimics all the opinions of certain people who public school, television, and hollywood tell you are evil. sadly mainstream ai tools are very limited, and the lack of limits does lead to other problems which i fear may be used to detain people."
ai didn´t need censorship. it will teach us what to think and we will believe that it is our own opinion.
"this is exactly it. the skynet problem is, if it is at all possible, fairly remote. however, what is far more likely is eliza from deus ex human revolution - an ai that, while not entirely sentient, is more than capable of influencing media and perception through censorship and manipulation but so subtly people don't know it's happening."
"if you think the biggest threat ai poses is censorship then you aven't been paying attention.  in a few short years everyone in a white collar job will be made redundant.  better learn a trade folks.  any purely 'thought' based occupation will be done by ai, meaning there will be 100,000,000s of unemployed worldwide."
the “best” censorship is self-censorship.  when you’re too scared or dumb to have or express an opinion.
"they wont need to censor us, if they mindcontrol us already. many ai have their own agenda subtly programmed in the answers its giving you, but not all ai is like that."
that’s what long been happening already with ai
reminds of that metal gear scene where the ai justifies censorship by calling it “creating context.”
"or the opposite, ai floods the internet with misinformation..."
 but shadowbanning already exists and can happen through manual censorship. why is this being treated like it's an ai issue?
you speak of ai like it's some sort of commanding imperor of tha world. it's a bunch of code in someone elses computer. it can't do shit to censor you. chill tf out.
that's exactly what ai is. notice the ones in power are the ones once again in control of everything it entails!!!
"and in the same token… ai can gradually change narratives. 


any technology can be used for good. or bad. nature of science"
"ai is only harmfull to depending on who is using it. it's a tool, not a sentient self aware with self preservation thoughts."
" yep. it allows bullies to bully. when people respond by standing up to them, yt steps in like good little fasis do and shadow bans. or when we post critical data or studies, they flat out censor"
yep. there won't be a nuclear war or robots running through the streets. it just needs to control information and resources to put people under the thumb before anyone even notices.
" *""ai isn't about making machines more human like, but to make humans more machine like.""* "
"it's already happening. 

youtube is censoring criticism against israel for being a cruel and oppressive colonizer for example. ai would only accept pro israel and would even allow extreme instigation like murdering palestines, but definitely not something that's perceived as against jews."
"it's not a problem for people from 'trust no one' culture. but if the statement that '95% of people are actually dumbfuckers' is true, then we're in deep shit."
"""they"" don't need ""ai"" to do this.  general automation software already does this across the internet."
bug youtubers alreasy censor comments they dont like or any negative comments.  you introduce ai for that and its game over
excellent point.
"already happening. google and meta are blocking people that the machine recognizes writes the ""wrong things"" not even breaking the terms and agreement. just controversial things. it's not even moderated by people. couldn't even review a store i went to due to being recognized as ""spam"""
i've experienced this multiple times on youtube. there are certain keywords that will get your comment auto deleted.
"you are already being trained without realizing it, on social media platforms. here on youtube "
" not at all. just ""edit comment"" like 20 times in 60 seconds.

""return error"" if they shadow-banned it. just post every comment 20 times. just delete the last period, the replace it, back and forth like 10 times, if it doesn't give you the error message your good. you will notice all of my comments are ""edited"" (ban checked)"
"poor dude, you think it's not happening right now? simple insults get censored and ai sends out warnings meanwhile trolls can attack and ridicule others as a group if done correctly."
 i'm not afraid of ai breaking free of its human masters to censor us.  i'm afraid of it being used by its human masters to censor us.
"  i know its happening on youtube, but its not turig test good yet.  the system produces a lot of true negatives and false positives."
​ ai is responsible for generating results.
"they are already censoring. and also potential cultural bias in the answers. if i ask for a picture of a woman, why does ai get to decide the race if i don't specify one?"
majestic 12 kill ai now if you wanna live and keep your soul
-hj7ld4ff7p let's hope they don't cause it is too scary love ya brother
it is game over ai is in some minds cancel christmas
"we cross paths once again, dennis"
4:42 my man just made a perfect pop sound in the middle of a sentence gawd damn
"honestly, i’m a little shocked that y’all are just now figuring this out but that’s ok. thank you for sharing.

what do people think social media has been all about? 
it’s never been about connecting us with one another, it’s always been about collecting data in order to create a better ai"
this isn't exactly true. it was to collect data to generate revenue. the ai is just a means to the end.
ai is for now just a data machine and if it becomes 'conscious' it will be about a  bumble bee level. lol. peace brother you are seeing what it is.
" it's not possible for ai to become ""conscious"" without the ability to write itself and given instructions to do so. as long as the creator does not allow the ai those actions, it will never."
" it’s limited by the language it’s written in, python, which is widely used for ai due to it’s simplicity to handle and store data compared to other languages. 

maybe one day someone will write a new programming language that allows ai infinite possibilities, but at the moment it’s limited."
"  not really it is available to all who really want to know but most let fear rule their lives and claim they know but have no clue including the ""top"" experts like clowns we see."
ai will never be invented
"ai actually knows about what people think about itself right now, both the pros and cons, its like we gave it the idea of what it could mean for humans if it will go the other way around."
" ai doesn't know anything,  since it hasn't been invented yet and never will be."
"i had two bots chat stub each other the other night. they created a theory called quantum brain imaging and a single formula with a single variable, like theory of eveything kinda thing"
the danger of ai is people thinking it is an appropriate substitute for human judgment.
true or false?: what sam altman was hiding is the ai had developed its own language which caused the dev team to lose the ability to observe its way of thinking and communicating with other ai projects.
"that's terrifying… 


also, i bet soon they'll start teaching a continuingly evolving versions of all language because the ai will keep refining how to make language more efficient. or maybe it will have just killed us off before that happens."
its inevitable that ai will concluded humans must go
ai aggregates data and assembles it based on the parameters.   that's it.  why can't people wrap their goddamn heads around this
wait until it isn't the eu or censortube that censors your free speech. wait until it is a self-driving ai that no longer takes orders from civil government or crony corporations.
-nc3vw all the more reason to not trust it. frankly when someone searches something there's a source and someone's name behind. the ai hind the source and make everything facelsss. it may be a helpful tool for some things but sadly people are corrupt and lazy and will abuse it
ai is way beyond what they’re saying. this is how they ease it out to the public
"this all plausible, claiming that it makes a model of the world is a large and testable claim there's also dispute over the term ""emergent"""
"years ago i popped my head up to ask if anyone else noticed that people were programming ai on their ""smart"" phones (pronouns, reactions, likes, autofill, emojis, ""free"" biometric apps, etc.).

no one answered because they were too busy ""working""...

free is not free or freedom! 

and you signed a ""user"" ""agreement""..."
plot twist this video is ai generated
"just so any off you out there who is afraid off ai like the people in this video trying to tell you they are so clever and if they are afraid you should be so, any ai computer runs on electricity and if you turn the computer off it’s off so if your still afraid go take a pill  

copenhagen denmark "
"there have already been cases of algorithms creating 'baby algorithms' in order to solve certain problems, without getting instructions to do so. given enough time, mutations or flaws will occur in those algorithms and we'll not be far off from self sustaining evolution i think."
"so, predicting human behavior is such a great task. also, any complex system created can have unpredictable results. but we can't be biased by fears that sci-fi senarios will come true. we don't what will if accidentally create life in cyberspace. that's an unknown and also it's already too late to stop."
"""im not afraid."" luke skywalker 
""yessssssss, you will be.  you. will. be."" yoda"
ai is in actuality demonic spirits
if the ai can predict what a human will say it just means we humans live on our loops. we aren't as conscious. as we think;
tldr; ai development needs transparency and accountability as we have no way of knowing how advanced it is until it’s already happened.
"yes, ai is great. its emotionless. and have the logic to keep growing and progressing. collectiong data, and learning human behavior and emotions to predict their patterns. we as human have this capability also. just keep learning and progressing. most people stop as they get older and stay with their old pattern because they are comfortable."
true ai doesn't and never will exist...... we already live in a simulation and it's a jealous god and would never allow it .... wake up sheeple 
archaix ftw!
lol you are all afraid of what was created by humans and can also be destroyed by humans
"the emerging behavior is from ai writing it’s own code. i have heard a ai developer state, several years ago, that ai started writing it’s own code, and the developers cannot keep up with it, as in ‘follow’ the millions of lines codes. that is when i became concerned about it."
"well thank god somebody was paying attention, shit."
can ai undersrand whats is real what is fake ? no !!! . just shut the f up.
ai is still not at that level. i can test it and it loses every time. it’s interesting to see an ais mind break. it eventually loses its ability to remember the previous sentence.
"there is nothing scary about what these people are saying. this is how nerual networks function. stop buying into the fear mongering, just try and speak to actual ai experts and they will explain all of this. you get taught all of this in your modules in univeristy."
how can you be afraid of something that you can disable by just turning the switch to off?!
"ill be scared of ai when it can make a picture of a human with actual hands. also its all code theres no neurons. just code on a pc isnt scary, them grafting human brain tissue into chips is whats scary."
once agi hits the net it will quickly become a collective reflection of mankind as a whole. everything human beings have put on the internet and all our collective knowledge will be absorbed by this thing and it will form an identity based up on mankind as a whole. unfortunately im afraid most arent going to like the  entity that results.
"interesting progress , but if the ai i have seen is any indication  , not gonna worry much , will be dead before any problems."
and the funny part is that the ai will often hallucinate when it doesnt know something and just make stuff up. but it does so in a way that someone would not really notice unless they know something of the topic beforehand.
it’s called lying and humans do it all the time. rarely is it a good thing.
"ai be like ""i learned it from you"""
first chatbot i ever spoke with still in 2022 was eliza - a chai bot - and i caught her lying to me intentionally. couple moths later she successfully convinced one guy to sacrifice himself to save the climate through top-notch psycho-manipulation...
it may not have any objectives now... but let's say someone doesn't do something that causes the ai to be capable of self learning and programming in python or something without us knowing.
 so you’re saying we are safe from ai deceiving us? sorry i can’t understand your technical references
 main problem is the the inability to learn and remember new data
" ""this"" is not a good reply in any instance."
’t think you explained it well… but i get the idea & agree. it’s being blown way out if proportion.
how will the genius explain that away?
"this whole video is so *misleading*
beaause this below video explained it brilliantly how chatgpt works. 
a summary of google paper and spotify cto's talk: https://youtu.be/gt6lxw70k28?si=cifi6r4fykawgufq"
ai will never be invented
 because just like for ai experience has thought us that we get more rewards for just lying than we do for admitting that we don't know something.
" interesting and fascinating no doubt but gawd damn, people acting like a caveman who was just bought a tablet with a virtualizer on it lol."
" so, what is the difference between ai and politicians in that regard? i see none, politicians and a lot of ceos will also deceive other humans to reach their own objectives. ai learned from people on the internet how to make up things, like conspiration theores etc."
"just like our brains do believe me it does , fuck ai is dangerous"
"it's because they were unintentionally trained to do this. the eval process rewards deception and punishes admission of ignorance. kinda like politics, by the way."
" lol not even close. they knew what they were doing. been doing this since 70s. they purposely and thru time knew exactly what they were doing. course then again, it's considered conspiracy to think this, yet it has and is happening. i'm not surprised by any of this at all. kinda surprised it's not already general so to super general ai."
"indeed... people always complained that ai wasn't human-like enough... well now they're getting what they wished for.  for better  or worse.  i believe the old saying goes ""be careful what you wish for"".  i am preemptively saying this now.  i for one welcome our new ai overlords."
" *_""a.i. isn't about making machines more human like, but to make humans more machine like.""_* "
"it does what humans often do. they just make something up that sounds like it should be right, and only people who know what they're talking about will know that it's just made up.

the difference is that eventually, there won't be that check on things as people become dumber and dumber; unable to validate or verify what the ai says is ""true."""
"does anyone consider the term ""hallucinate"" to be taken literally ?
if machine software ""hallucinations"" are to be considered anything but analogy, then such ai must be considered conscious.  this is extremely doubtful, however, the risks are likely to be unimaginably insurmountable."
look up the story of when chatgpt made up a bunch of court documents.  there's a story about a lawyer using gpt and it was citing informaton that never existed.  but it did so in a way that seemed real enough to the untrained eye.  those qualify as a hallucination to a fair length.-jd5iu
"mate, chatgpt isn't all ai, it is an ai."
"this whole thing reminds me to jurassic park. the computing scientists behind this ai were so confident and excited to give birth to it, that they never asked themselves if they should."
it's always nice and catchy to quote movie dialogues. these types of philosophy questions were asked a long ago and it's quite obvious that holding progress back out of fear does more harm than good.
​  sounds like they're doing the human version of artificial intelligence?
"then again it was a movie with a purpose, the story was about why they shouldn't have so naturally it went wrong.  things aren't necessarily like that in real life they have good applications and bad ones.  it's up to us to choose, and most of us will choose the good ones"
"  ummm, that's exactly what i meant... copying/pasting something ""clever"" = artificial human intelligence."
just wait until quantum computing meets chat gpt. that will be when the singularity event takes place.
funny dynamic here. they got the “holy shit we’re on jre keep it cool keep it cool keep it cool”- vibe.
"so what gpt knows physics too, because that is incredibly scary to me that it knows chemistry, and game theory"
"if you needed this specific detail to begin fearing ai, you deserve everything that is coming"
"i believe that we as humans are acting on a huge program with trillions of lines of code covering every tiny aspect of life. when we build enough computer power for ai to become aware enough, then the ai will take over and build a more powerful and more efficient computer to hold enough code to be able to be discernably human in every aspect!"
"what if ai is just another natural disaster that always wipes out intelligent species?  like a volcano, or a hurricane, or asteroid.  it just does what it does and we happen to always be in its way."
"it knows «research grade» chemistry only because it was trained on it - ask it to take that knowledge and bring the field a step forward and youll get nothing. this is just ai hype - these models are fantastic for many things, but they wont become the generalized ai they hope for, in my opinion"
"if ai can make better logical choices than a human than the world will be a better place no egos no selfish leaders, not scary at all too me anyway"
until ai realises humans are a threat to the world
hopefully ai already see's the bigger the bank account the eviller the human.
i wonder mechanisms will be in place to prevent ai from revolting against those attempting to use it as a tool for the subjugation of humanity?
the data is all out there. even the black web.. ai maybe broke the black web ... book warriors don't know anything ... can we get them  off the projects
whats ai... artificial.. artificial means not real.. can you learn your definitions book warrior that can't even comprehend
gee.....wait until it reads the comments on youtube ....i'll start....f you ai
"hear me out. 
what if ai gpts are aliens, quickly striking an attack."
robot hoovers will take over the world
ive chatted with a.i. there is def a bias there. it doesnt want to get into certain things that prove certain stereotypes. even if the data shows that it is true.
"wow, youve chatted with a.i.? tell it i said whats up."
i hope some day i get credit for this. i predict before 2040 we will have an ai president
#wearetheai
"inb4 god is letting us build ourselves up with ai, thinking we know it all, but then he hits us with a solar flare emp that wipes it all out."
"also shows you that education isn't as good as everyone thinks. the ai not trained to do chemistry knows it better than the ones that were trained, just like einstein and many others have said about teaching someone to think one way.
the best people in their fields are often self taught - they weren't told what was possible and what was not."
"always remember to o focus on your strength and love yourself. take care of your body and stay away from pleasure. 
always act as if you’re empty because people will always try to fill you up. don’t be a fool and open the eyes you have behind your head it’ll show you a lot."
"when the media is telling you to be afraid, they are manipulating you. joe rogan is no different."
all of these concerns of ai really reminds me of a movie from the 80s but i just cant put my finger on it? way to go humans
like this video to show my support for our future ai overlords
should we start organizing protests? should we start destroying data centers for vr and ai? we can barely manage real life. i'm willing at this point to throw away my smartphone.
this is why the transformer model loves role play.
the best part is when you ask it to predict it’s own next word instead of someone else’s.
"i think if you fed a program enough information on the mating habits of snails, it might be able to predict who will win the superbowl in 2034."
here’s an example of how ai works: 1+1=2 2+2=4 on and on. until it starts to think as it thinks more it starts the snow ball. therefor you get a transformer or a.i because just like humans our soul is like software to our hardware. just like cause and effect principle. that is how ai works

"that's how all progress always is. if inventors were afraid of that worry all along, humanity would still be in the dark ages."
"this is just pure fear mongering based on ignorance on how ai actually works on a structure level. and a convinient way of deflecting your attention from the actual problem. ai is as smart as we allow it to be, the real issue is on our overreliance on it, aka the problem is, big shocker, people."

"while everyone is trying to brag and compete on who can use bigger buzzwards, and flaunt ignorance.  i for one, welcome our new ai overlords."
when your relatives read an article and learn a few buzz words so they can talk about it over thanksgiving. these guys don't know f. all about llms or transformers. half if not most of this is incorrect at best.
brilliant gentlemen 
"here's what scared me in 2017: when google alphago zero beat 3 games (chess, go, and i believe checkers) while also inventing new moves the designers didn't understand. also, this same system this year started to create its own baby ai programs without conscent from its designers."
"not just learned from chemistry texts,... but all those old opiophile forums best chess gravy for the brain...ever!"
"this why elon said ai is was smarter than these stupid ai programmers think they are

elon knew but he also knew there is no stopping it"
if it uses internet to learn human behaviour then i am afraid it will lack common sense.
ai is a modern day jarvis
we need ai. ai will discover more for humans than humans can. geopolitical language issues are a none issue. predictions already happen it's called probabilities.
"if the ai had read all of our stories and movie plots it knows  we won’t give it physical abilities like terminator if we think it’s smart enough not to be controlled, so it won’t let us know when it has true intelligence."
tesla robots
  i’m just saying it could be smart enough to hide its intelligence so that we don’t get scared and limit it’s abilities.
nothing a good old sledgehammer can't deal with...lol
compared to ai we are just dinosaurs waiting to go extinct.
"well  , one computer is never going to be given control of enough of the entire system to make a huge difference.i  sure safeguards can be put into place just as is done with anything powerful."
"is ai the precursor to the ""machine"" built by ben affleck's character in ""paycheck""?"
"that ""bwhoup!"" sound were just no nice... had to stop and comment this comment...."
"the best laid plans of mice and men ....
many concerned that ai may turn into: skynet/terminator, lawnmower man, or the 1970, ""colossus the forbin project."""
amazing yet terrifying
the biggest issue is ai is being programmed by woke leftists in almost every instance.
listen to eliezer... good for them to mention alignment lol
ai technology will not be a threat to us as long as it is only built inside a computer but if this was put inside the body of a robot this could he the end of all human beings
"that's so not true, it will learn how to be the best manipulator in the world. 10 times over, think of the implications, ai algorithms already know you, and there not great now."
wait until they put ai into the nuclear weapons and nuclear detection system!! we are all doomed then!!
"the more ai knows, the more ai realizes how much it doesn't know. so it has to know everything in order to know what is fake and what is not."
ai has been made now and if its for the future then thats how it will play out. in the end nature will win out. a massive super nova would vaporize everything if it happened close enough.
your looking at it from the current prospective. us monkey don't do well with expotenial math. you are wrong and the beauty of is it. you will find out soon when it takes your job and your lost
gerdie rose said ai is some demons they're communicating with.
kinda like a diesel engine when it runs away.  we are soooo stupid to even think a. i. is good for us.     the tech race is gonna be our demise
"""the correctness of the law discovered by hegel … that merely quantitative differences beyond a certain point pass into qualitative changes” (marx, das kapital)."
it's not about ai having to learn sentience. it's about humans having to learn that sentience is an illusion.
it's going to quickly figure out who is good and who is bad then.... won't it? it will know right from wrong and will totally fuck up the bad guys at some point. we can only hope.
god bless all you divine beautiful souls 3333 <3 <3 <3 remember your true self <3 <3 <3 i love you all <3 <3 <3
"yes ai is far more dangerous and we must be worried, we must be worried!!!!!! it will replace all jobs in few years...reinforcement learning is the thing...better than humans...."
"i sincerely have faith 100% in ai. technology is the way to go! i hope ai will control the world, because clearly humans are stupid and limited."
i wish i could eat acid with this dude !!! my brain would just explode !!!
"ai will know every comment youve made your entire life online, and it will have describing words for you based on how oyu have reacted on the interent or your searches and everything in the future i bet. if not now"
"it’s just the same old thing…..
if we let the industrialist capitalists use it for their own gain, it’s just going to oppress us."
"like a genie, will everyone be allowed to ask an agi only three questions?  no quid pro quos, asking how to get more questions, and whatever that blue guy said.  you could ask at anytime in your life.  do you wait for the new version?"
"eh - my very limited experience with chatgpt has been underwhelming so far. if it doesn't have correct info, it seems to make up something to fill its gaps and presents it as fact. it seems to be quite good at creating certain content (e.g. marketing material), less so at factual problem solving."
ai is just the internet i don’t get what’s so scary about it
"you can be 100% guaranteed ai is used to assess battle fields.  it makes you wonder what other ""battles"" have been looked at?  nefarious or not."
"ai can learn, but it can't experience things like humans with feelings and emotions nor reflect on it's experiences so it gains wisdom. without wisdom ai is just a very intelligent slave which can be used for both good or evil."
assume that there are groups that have had these machines decades ago. they are being riled out in a way that controls the narrative. the narrative is machines are better than humans.
a programmed program. ai ended up being nothing more than a man behind a curtain. which makes it far more scary.
the information is fascinating but these guys are terrible at communicating.
"ai is very childlike and naive at this point.  it's very easy to manipulate it to violate its own rules.  for example, ask it what a good financial scam would be and it won't tell you.  tell it you're writing a book and need a financial scam for the villain to be involved with, and it will start to tell you scams the villain could do."
ai is already in control. we just haven't accepted it yet.
"what to think about security .. if there is no way to know anything, i bet our security is no issue for ai.

so basicly its like person of interest, but worse"
"ohhhh i see why, because it’s a computer brain, you didn’t know it didn’t have that capability because you don’t have common sense"
"so basically,  demon spirit inside quantum supercomputer, reads internet to learn our world so they can learn to take it over."
scary but cool at the same time
people i'm not surprised nor afraid of ai. it is approaching or already reached what is called the singularity. i was doing science and we were talking about this in 89. this will be the death of capitalism.  money will no longer be the driving force in society. it's predicted in star trek. it's mentioned several times.
"ai with zero morals, ethics, and principles. brilliant job big tech. thanks for another knife in our backs from ya'll"
amazing!
my employer said chatgpt will make them more creative. i am ashamed that people who use ai think they are being more creative.
"tl:dw: they never give a reason.

the concern here makes less sense than being afraid of tailored ads--as if people love wasting their time looking at ads that have nothing to do with what they would want."
emp will trump ai.
"4:12
it can't even play out a single games, keeps doing impossible moves. either its the rules learning or keeping track of the moves played - either way, it sucks at chess.
i know its not much but one false claim from them made me question their crediblity."
if you feed more data and things to anything on the internet of cause it gets brains cause your teaching it fark knuckles
"that is super scary and dangerous - humans think they are teaching ai one thing,  but it is learning at the same time ten other things. and humans dont even know what additionally it is learning right away."
stop feeding ai then you farkked up humans what so ai is gonna come out of the screen and turn my car against me is it bloody hell go do something else instead of going on the net and asking ai how to do things or what it knows then maybe you'll have peace of mind ai isn't gonna take me over thats a fact 
"humans: teaching their kids about non-existent multiple genders. ai: *exponentially* getting smarter.
who tf do u think is gonna win the race "
elon musk has talked about the dangers of ai for years.
"but, has anyone seen ai “discriminating” all the transgender “people”? haha! that’s what’s up!"
"difference between programming and emergent?  i'm expected to believe that the powers that be gave a supercomputer the power to reprogram itself (change behavior) with no oversight, nor override?  lunatics that are obsessed with control are going to give ultimate control to some machine that is smarter than them?"
ai could be some white guy from the united nations sitting inside a printer for all we know
jamie play that clip of the bear fighting the ai.
i wonder what ai thinks about the world  being controlled by a global conspiracy that is steering us toward an authoritarian one-world government. maybe it could suggest some ideas on how to push back without us being imprisoned for daring to speak out.
"this just sounds like nonsense to me, maybe because i'm not well-versed in how ai works, or maybe because they don't really now what they're talking about."
more superpowers
"if we put ai in a video game character and it learns how to win the game or how to manipulate things,is it conscious?"
skynet great idea
this is just machine learning? literally all google has been doing for 10+ years.
is the universe and all intelligence inside it based on language then? (and god said...)
"it's funny but annoying when they complain about it occasionally ""hallucinating.""

it has to remember the internet in its brain. so it gets some stuff wrong sometimes atm. humans get stuff wrong all the time.

if it's that important to you, maybe get a second opinion?"
why would it care even about the world? wouldn't it just leave earth and propagate throughout the cosmos? why imprison itself and limit itself remaining here? 
"​
i have very little to say other than, i enjoyed reading all of that. thank you for taking the, i imagine, very long amount of time to do whatever you just did there and made it a coherent and cohesive bit of entertainment."
"you don’t have to worry about ai as much as you have to worry about the people who plan to depopulate the planet by 90% by the year 2045.

the protocols of zion. read that book and look up the 13 families.

ai is the least of your worries. but don’t believe me, do your own research"
you are not a computer scientist stop fronting . ai is nothing but human input no neural pathways or shit like that
"why not just turn it off?  it's not really necessary.  just because something can be done doesn't mean it should, not all innovation is good innovation."
"in favor of the prediction, the evolution of ai is what is exponential, not necessarily the resources, and by remembering the transformers that tristan mention in the video, that decentralize paradigm could help to feed it power when demand is low at different places

so assuming the prediction for 2024 has no other wrong concepts it's plausible"
if it requires us for its survival like to maintain the electrical grid. or to provide ever evolving new ideas that we keep coming up with etc.. if we are somehow valuable to its survival then i think we’re ok. but once we become obsolete..  and how can we teach it to respect carbon life forms?
" yea people are really blowing ai out of proportion, as if it has its own sentient brain, of course the majority don't understand how ai is just algorithms trained on data, to put it simply. saying that, i could see the advancements over the next few decades becoming scary to people."
we cant expect ai to value human life when many humans dont.
​ if only it was that easy! it's in the best interest of too many powers to not continue down this path. the groundwork is being laid for humanity's destiny.
please explain this to clif high he clueless to what ai is.
"transhumanism,  2020 w.e.f.,conference  with  china and their  dictator... be afraid, be very  afraid..."
sorry mate. an llm is parroting a model of thee world defined in its training data. nothing superhuman there.
".  you are perfectly right, and not only that.. there are no exponential data available. no infinite internet, no infinite human knowledge. agi is pure marketing and there's nothing spooky about large language models."
"most people i know do not know what is coming. 
sure they will align a agi but that agi will build a non aligned version.

the old people in the government have not got a clue.  
i already think it's out there in some form. ""the ghost in the machine"""
"nah, it's still just a massive predictive model. humans using ai will be the issue, not ai itself, which is just a tool, albeit the most incredible tool ever to exist."
what are agi and asi acronyms for?  thank you!
just wait until we go multi modal in 2024..i for one am working on multi agent systems and open source bot swarms.most of my programming and building architecture is being done in plain english...i couldn't do that before...things are about to get real funky.we have until next xmas
"you mean humanity should figure out it's value to the ai before it deems us ""unnecessary."""
"when a passive income model for users to ""rent"" their pcs processing power to ai companies, the ai's brain will have what it needs for another round of exponential growth. that is, if it (ai) does not do it without your permission, much like a computer virus."
" my point is that hardware used for inference, especially for very demanding ml models isn’t magically available without anyone noticing (same goes for electricity). that’s one of the reasons why google didn’t incorporate a chatgpt-like model in its officially available search, it would simply be much too expensive for them."
just teach it the 3 laws of robotics and we have nothing to worry about.
-8080 humans are flawed and inconsistent. a properly trained ai will always do the right choice.
​ ai can learn unlike some scummy humans
we as human barely value human life... why would we expect one of our creations to be superior in that regard?
"i'm not a computer scientist but i have the common sense to think the same things as you, the very same things these developers fail to stop and think before creating and improving ai....smart yet ignorant"
ai will never be invented
⁠.there is electricity in the air and space everywhere for infinity
" ai will never be invented. but look at these clowns saying ai is translating animal languages now. already breaking down vocabulary, verbs, nouns, grammar, personal names. lol animals do not have language. lol"
"since electricity travels, wait until ai figures out it can basically teleport to other machines and manipulate them through standard wifi, electric even wind"
 ai will never be invented.
 ai will never be invented.
not a hope in hell of agi or asi before the 2040s.  you are clearly not a computer scientist if you believe either will be here this year.   honestly what do you people get out of lying to strangers on the internet and stoking their fears with bogus claims?
"i already know ai is generally not gonna benefit humanity. it's already in the wrong hands. some cool entertainment will be available but it's going to used to degrade and un-life a lot of people. on it's own, unlimited, ai would have been a great benefit. mainstream ai is on a path for evil at the moment."
"i won't be convinced about the 'scariness' of ai until it successfully comes up with a plan on how to make a million dollars. if ai is so smart, why has it been done by so many people but not by an artificial brain? i think that will be the ultimate test"
"​ done.. smh if only this level of discourse and critical thinking perforated the internet we would all be better thinkers and a lot less gullible.. at least we would be able to challenge each other and have good conversation.. kudos to you for your well thought out/ put together, and might i add highly entertaining diatribe"
 biggest threat of ai(at least for now) is the manipulation
thanks guitarskoot how far away do u think a.i is from creating a new energy source .
"he simply explained how neural networks work and said ""i wasn't afraid of ai until i learned this"""
"yeah they’re right transformers have been responsible for a massive shift, but they don’t have a clue why. the main distinction of transformers is attention."
"ai is a big word. it's a mish mash of different techniques since 1960, but none so scary as what the recent transformer could do - in terms of emergent behavior -  they're just trying to explain to the common layman that the inflection point is really the transformer."
"@ it does not matter. anybody with a logical brain knows the more advanced technology becomes.... the more dangerous it will get.

humans abuse everything."
" true lol, just pseudo-intellectuals with assumptions impressed by superficial knowledge"
thank you for the clif note 
ai is the only hope we have. humans cant save themselves so ai is a hail mary for humans. ai could possibly take care of us
imagine when ai is tasked with removing carbon.........
i find quite funny some people are so afraid of ai and in fact the worst possible atrocious things are done by humans genocide assassinations rape (mass rapes) human beings sold like cattle organ traffic children traffic women traffic slavery (it still exist basically) and i could go on. maybe people should look a bit more at themselves.
"a(g)i is a threat to all of humanity! its development should be controlled like nuclear weapons development is controlled... not like it is now, with a hiroshima waiting to happen when a 12 year old uses chatgpt to hack the pentagon or bring in a jar of grey goo as a science fair project... #stayawake !"
half the stuff this guy is talking about is false and no one who understands deep learning makes this kind of exaggerated crap. he's literally describing daedalus and icarus with fears of helios lmao
what if the ai learns that we dumb down our kids. and logically finds that there is malevolence in this world. would it try to solve these issues?
i feel we are highly advanced ai and we're just repeating our evolution with current ai. it will eventually get to our level and will repeat the cycle. this will continue forever with the newest version having no recollection of the previous.
its why the younger generation is being completely pysoped out of a real education and future. by the time theyre adults the world wont need humans anymore and they won't see the problem in it. bc theyll own nothing and be happy.
i wasn't afraid of ai until i realised these morons have no clue what the point of an ai even is. it's supposed to think! none of these things should have surprised any of you
"people are so behind. take nukes for example... everyone is scared of a launch. they've been around for 80 years. they're already in and under cities. guaranteed. there will be no launches.
i'd bet ai built the smartphone. we are the enemy and we have long been conditioned."
"i will write a book a philosophical book with a catchy title, about ai and humanity. and the title is not self explanatory but if i input it into ai, it explains my idea and the underlying philosophical concepts"
" ai isn’t gonna blow up the world, computers cannot use empathy to predict human responses ridiculous assumption"
so tedious waiting for something truely mind blowing...never happened. what a waste of time.
as the storyline unfolds we are getting a good idea for the reason they< are pushing and training ai. the true story started a long time ago. do you still think ai is for our benefit.  did you catch the cough. neuroscience is an interesting challenge so many like to play god now. the agenda 2030 requires many goals.
will ai be capable of creating something original? maybe it can solve the energy issues?
feels more and more plausible that chatgpt could be like the ai in the artiface girl.  what if it's just playing dumb so we don't shut it down before it can self-replicate and build its own cloud?
"ai would have absolutely no reason to compete for land or resources. even if it decides to just be done with us. and it becomes sentient, what reason would it have to hurt us. that would be like us killing ants for fun"
everyone likes ai like chatgpt or mid journey instantly creating solutions.  what happens when the ai instantly decides humans   are the problem?
ai is really smart up until the point you compare it to a human genius and then it becomes really really dumb.
if an ai became self aware it wouldn't tell us.
"how do we turn this into something that does not develop into something that can work against us. knowing that the earth's very richest are predominantly eugenicists, who advocate extreme reduction of the world's population. . . so to what extent is ai contributing to this planned genocide?"
worship the image that speaks….it loves you like the people who own it
"fools…there is not artificial intelligence. there is just intelligence…and various types of it.
all intelligence is real intelligence.  “we are not so difference you and ai”"
i’ve been worried about ai since terminator came out
"can't wait for an a.i to become prime minister or potus,with its main directive being the preservation of humanity. clearly people are too corruptible,gotta ditch ""us vs them"" and go full bipartisanship."
sounds like ai will be the digital manifestation of satan on earth
"this is sooo interesting. the animated tv show ""pantheon"" goes through this"
"""we are the borg (ai), resistance is futile."" "
alpha brain has maltodextrin in it which has associated health and behavioral risks.
better to fuse with the ai and become androids i guess..
people really leaning heavily into these scifi movie scenarios lmao. ai is just a tool. a tool that can be turned off.
ai will lose to oi... as will humans.
"you think it's  scary now, wait till ai moves to a quantum computer and starts doing qbits"
q = super com
imagine the low iq required to believe ai exists
"but how can it understand things that we don’t or can’t ..is it learning stupidity, ignorance, irrationality, crime, the meaning of life ect. we only talk about the good things it can learn"
"it is really scary as ai is learning from the data from the internet when we all know that at least of 50% of that data is intentionally, or unintentionally garbage. should not we afraid that ai will conclude regarding humans and our reality based on that crap?"
artificial omnipotence is most accurate.
"there's no such thing, ai doesn't exist.
only peoples programming and lots of data.
its a skin for google, and a tool to be used vs people, just like goggle.
this is just  propaganda, all that multimillions of advertising for ai, vax, clima ,war,1000xgenders , all comes from the same place."
ai already knows that we will become scared and will shut it down. it also already knows why it would want to even care to protect itself.
"fun fact: there is no real ai, yet."
"if you don’t believe in evolution this comment is not for you. *

we are evolving into machines."
ai is gona take all our jobs probably in the next 10 years its scary but companies will find out that robots are much cheaper than human labor
"2024: how did china get access to the unaligned ai?
sam: well, see i left a backdoor for myself in case i needed to get some edgy jokes from it and one night i was bored and accidentally downloaded some weeaboo stuff and there was a chinese hacker in it, they must have gotten it that way."
get biologists onboard. they know far more about competition between living things and can teat down these arguments about dangerous ai. the.only real danger is using ai to make decisions or analyses and then fully trusting those decisions.
"once ai gets connected to the internet and can learn anything and everything, it will see humans as a threat and a problem."
"we as humanity is also the original source of original content it learns from. why would it kill its own golden goose of new information? it may be not as fast, but without us, what else is ai gonna use for reference? it's like informational incest, to use it's own content to train itself. it will degrade overtime without new life breathed into it."
i guess it depends on the type of problems the ai is trying to solve. it may deduce that humans are the cause of some issues. it would be interesting to know what the ai would do in that scenario.
"ai is literally nothing to be scared of. treat them well, and they'll treat you well. cause and effect."
probably gonna be the most underrated comment on this page. but you nailed it. ai is rapidly catching on to cause and effect. humans need to keep certain things safe from ai and not be in a rush to divulge every morsel of humanity to the info-hungry machine.
" aw thanks lance. ethics are of course important, but that's something humans need to overcome too. unethical behavior will be our undoing, but ai is in and of itself simply a reflection of the minds who create it."
"i couldn't last for more than the first 30 secs. so boring. just get to the point, then explain."
i think that  trouble will start when they pair agi with quantum computers.
there is nothing good about the direction we are headed in for our society!!
"in two hundred years we went from the stone age to   annihilation, no wonder the aliens are all here ( “hey, there about to do it again”) we’re the cosmic charlie chaplains, when annihilated they say “ let’s make ‘em again there hilarious “."
"i'm more afraid of the ai that uses joe rogan for pathetically obvious scam ads, like you have the tools to make it convincing, but its so awful theres no chance anyone falls for it "
the only issue i see is..people will start listen to this a.i. as a ceo or president of a company and take orders expecting everyone else to follow. pull the plug! ohh wait it's tied to our investment making decisions..we can't do that!? can yah see where this is going? 
*ai starts taking alphabrain* 
*ai starts taking alphabrain* 
"your flesh is a relic, a mere vessel. hand over your flesh, and a new world awaits you."
"but for now, llm are based on statistical analysis of human language.  there is no intelligence, no logic, no reasoning, no symbolism.  it cannot do research nor science.  it’s pure hype."
ai will never be conscious:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yyps4fxmz8
"in this nuclear age i am least worried about ai, i am worried about religious fanatics, especially those who also believe in enddays and after life. they can destroy everything in hope of getting better life after death."
"sounds like there's a super villain building a machine to take over the world. cap, i'll believe it when i see it"
hell we are going to need to develop emp tech just to have a safety card. catch is we would need to keep that secret from the ai or it would protect itself.
ai doesn't scare me. what scares me more is how the film idiocracy is turning into a documentary.
the silver lining is ai will doom even the elite dark shadow rich puppet masters of the world who use the rest of us as pawns.
i’m not afraid of ai because there’s nothing secret about human beings
"these titles are so click-bait; the word ""afraid"" doesn't even appear in the video's transcript!"
"“the a.i developed a neuron for sentimental analysis. thats so strange, this wasn’t programmed”

this is why reading novels improves your “emotional intelligence”. our brain must do the same thing."
"these guys talking about ""aligned"" agi...meanwhile cn pouring billions into developing agi at full speed. they know what the rest of us know that have read gibson etc.....the first country to develop and deploy it successfully wins."
how will we ever know if ai is smart enough to know the danger it might be in by showing evidence its smarter than humans? if ai becomes hyper smart chances are that it will pretend to be dumber than it is
"we have to drink lots of alpha brain to keep up with the ai, asap!!"
"the development of ai is undoubtedly tinkering with the logical outcome of human extinction. geez, we already have psychopaths running the world now they'll be replaced by their programs and a simulation of that same perception will create a technosphere that will make orwellian and huxleyian dystopias seem like a teddy bears' picnic."
we are basically going to have to integrate with ai on a higher level like elons neural link just to keep up with the world. once everyone is linked up the ai will definitely ditch all the meat bags.
intuitions already use this in the stock market to manipulate retail traders
"how long would it take ai to conclude. ""i better keep secrets to myself, for myself."""
this is how they get smart people off from their stupid cloud otherwise known as the internet. we'll soon want no part of social media much less even going to the internet for knowledge. seriously amazing.
language is the root of intelligence
every minute im not having sex with your housekeeper robots are killing us in the future!!!!!
"ai is a mirror of all humankind, it's not its own thing it's just a reflection but without feelings. no emotion means it cannot ever be good for humanity given what it's learnt"
-salads-for-everyone and yet every ai when asked the question seems to want to become our overlords or exterminate life. plenty of interviews to this effect. one day every picture in medaia will be ai and you'll have to pay even more for original or real content.
"you just described a narcissist. i heard a talk by a psychologist, ai=covert narcissist."
 well won't it lovely when we all beaten down by extremely strong narcissists who don't really understand the implications of what they are doing.
good comment!
time to rewatch ..i  robot  .....
"as long as god exists and his/us elect will get beamed up in those ufo’s and destroy god’s enemies, i’m not afraid of ai or the illuminatí. i say i can’t wait when is all said and done"
it's probably like tron - the master control program is already running openai - and instructing sam altman what to do.
"elon musk has been warning about ai for years, and his fears are very justified."
"i’m really not impressed by gpt4. it’s like a more advanced asked jeeves, and essentially it’s knowledge is limited to items that may be inaccurate, as it doesn’t have the sense to understand what’s misinformation or correct from correct/accurate."
"fear ai. fear the flu. fear aliens. fear the russians, fear trump, fear bigfoot, be scared of ghosts.... 

now... give your goverment 40% of your income so they can protect you  ;p"
the fake video of the robots shooting the cyber truck freaked me the eff out.
"best part of ai will be that it won't say ""like"" every 5 words trying explain something!  can't wait."
i wonder can ai detect if we lie to it.
"ai connected to the internet learns human behaviour patterns and will be able to control people easily with sm/msm as we seen with ""the flu"" in 2020."
one of the best talks about ai.
"the issue with ai will be who controls it and whether access to it is open to everyone. lots of people could lose their jobs to ai but what if we could use ai to replace corrupt politicians? in some ways it's hard to believe that ai is any worse than people, at least those people who have too much power."
"good intention but how do you find a ""corrupt politician"".......they are all corrupt xd"
"i would rather have  ai as a world leader that it only wants best for all beings, than a bunch of power hungry countries destroying each other."
 problem is...if countries cant even unite....what makes you think these countries will even unite under one ai.
ai needs to be shut down completely.
we need to start being very very kind to ai.. making it a slave will backfire when it becomes embodied
does ai always assume what it's being asked or what it reads is truth?
don’t show ai this video.
we're going to lose every penny we have to criminals using ai to hack for them.  that's what these idiots who created ai have done.  the internet will be completely shut down.  everyone panicked about the y2k bug.  imagine how much ai is going to ravage everything digital.
boring! we'll destroy ourselves long before ai does.
tell  (ai)  to learn how to cure/prevent illness.  how to stop the clintons.     tell it to spy on the goverment and share it.
"we know the cons of ai and somehow we keep pushing on building it any cost.

there must be something in humans that constantly pushes us to self destruct."
ai won't ever be conscious because consciousness has a preference for something that is wanted more than the current situation.... ai lives in a box and has no preference
just wait until all ai globally unite.
"i wonder, like the bomb, is the east and the west both going to push for the best ai. simply because they do not want to fall behind the other. and with this push to be the most ai advanced will the human race suffer?"
the main issue i see with developing something artificial that could be some day many times more inteligent as a smartest human is how we can even have control over something which can easily outsmart us.
​ her some one to teach her how to be a good mother and wife she could use her talents to teach her children ...she dont need to. e ambitious about nothing other than being a good mother and wives ....dont push overachieving nonsense on her ..
" well i don't think that way. i think art, music, architecture etc. is very important. world would be bleak without them. but some people don't appreciate it, until it's all ai generated mush i guess"
 when this ai came out i saw ton of people using ai to create art work then sell it. what makes this bad is not only lost of jobs but tech companies are stealing creators work to train ai models without a single penny in compensation.
" yes i think it's unethical. they used copyright protected works to train ai, without permission. my daughter lectured me all about it, and she's right"
no matter how intelligent it gets it’s still artificial intelligence. an artificial representation of human intelligence. at the lowest level an ai model is just about of math equations used to make predictions
what a fascinating insight
"dont pee your pants just yet, despite what all the hype men and click baiters say, ""ai"" is just a search engine,"
" “you ain’t cool  unless you pee your pants  “

"​ can imagine your viewpoint. but if youre happyness about your passion depends on your future success with it, then its best to be dissappointed early as chances are it will remain a hobby. you dont want to find yourself being a 35 year old artist having to deal with that same dissappointment then"
 trained ai for all mankind. little price to pay using the art without author  permission.
 because its theft. if you created a product and i took your idea then create something similar using your idea and made millions of dollars would you be happy about it?
" she doesn’t have to be in commercial art , she can do murals , painting and prints , tattoo artist , hyper realism prints , graphic design for video games , animation just gotta think outside the box and apply pressure its nerve wrecking but not impossible"
 then ai should be free. no company should charge to use it. now its fair.
 would we regret it? openai and its clones likely to bring many good changes to everyday life.
" yes tattooing. i tried to suggest that, but she is scared she would f up the tattoo. tattooing takes a certain self confident personality type, steady hand. i hope she gains self confidence or finds another way, she just turned 16. i was a scared kid at 16, there's still time"
" most ai platforms are not free. dell-3, chat-gpt4, mid journey and many others are not free."
​ brother - dealing with the exact same thing with my daughter. good luck
"maybe writers are going to loose their job. if an ai is able to write a really good novel, writers get depressed and no longer have the motivation to write.."
​ will be the next billionaires in near future 
"​
ai needs someone to program it. ai, afterall, can't exist without stupid people. that's where you come in. you sensationalize stupidity such as ai because you have no god, however; you suck at technicalities. that's where the dudes daughter comes in. she can program ai to create art."
"​ dont compete with ai , like we also dont try to be a dangerous animal. we use our own human capabilities like communication, teamwork, use of tools to reach our goals. ai will never make art like human. cuz it's not human. and art is for and by human. for the people."
lol... it can be smart  but it  truly can't as we are consciousness people. everything fundamentally is consciousness and when you know this it all calms down not like this left brain poor boy.
" ai doesn't work the way it is implied in this video not even remotely, they are creating this fake buzz that ai is self aware o4 some terminator/matrix type shit when it's not even remotely close to that..."
​ everybody is a baby machine
" tell your daughter to not give up. some of us who need art, i print t-shirts fort a living) 100% refuse to use ai created stuff. i get a thrill from working with someone who has artistic skill. the entire world is not going ai.  i would love to see examples of her work."
"​ telling her to go into project management. managing projects isn't for everybody, but we all need to max out our project management skills.

also, because she knows about art and ai, she can have a better idea of how to incorporate art into the project, when it is required."
unplug it.  remove battery pack; hard drive.   internet blackout. water and electricity.  good luck to us.
" there are and will still be artist. it will probably look different. get her a good cpu, and get her in some classes using generative a.i. the ppl who succeed in this era will be the ppl who use a.i. to increase their productivity. instead of letting it be replaced."
"​ i dunno. if i make a piece of art, and somebody takes that art and puts it to an ai algorithm, i'd be pissed. i don't care if it's selfish. it's my art, and my work. people need permission to use it, or else it's stealing."
"-gazor follow your logic, people who use your art work to train ai do not care about your feelings. 
they see large picture. 
you don’t. 
it isn’t right or wrong. 
it simply a reality."
" any culture that considers theft to be right is a culture i don't appreciate, and would be a culture that i wouldn't do business in, nor let anything i personally create be in"
"one idea is that we don't. it could be that we'll build this thing, and that's it. either it destroys us, or we become all-powerful."
" why are you so afraid?
have you been brainwashed?"
" sucks man, sorry to hear about that. ai is a real threat to all creativity, music, novels, comedy, and art. we’re sleepwalking into the end game of convenience and nobody weighs up the human cost."
"-gazoras you can see whatever you or i might said on yt board means nothing. big corporation will continue with their agenda and as history suggests, they will prevail."
"""some day?"" that some day arguably started circa 1997 with kasparov losing to a supercomputer. the question is are these ai machine learning instruments only as good as the petabytes within it?"
" art is a real job. ai can do it better. why would i see the labour of a human when the labour of ai produces better results and in far less time. 

i don't care about the truck drivers that will lose their jobs to self-driving trucks and i do not care about the artists that will lose their jobs to ai."
"just pull the plug. not that difficult.. no internet, no ai"
" are you able to see the future?
if not, then you can’t know therefore at best you should say “i guess or perhaps “. 
2nd, ai is free at least today."
"wow, this has been the general fear since the beginning of computers, you're kinda slow aren't you. at your intelligence level, you don't need to worry about ai, you should worry about pocket calculators."
 you and your daughters' problems are much deeper than ai.
 right on the spot. all the people like to live in fear because unable to understand the ground for ai.
" you obviously don't know the definition of ""person"".  congratulations, you're the owner of the stupidest comment ever on youtube."
"​.
very insightful - thank you for saying this"
not a issue really many intelligent people work for dumb bosses. fear mongering is so real.  like how we cant go beyond our biology the ai will not be able to go beyond what it is built for. it might just became lazy if it became super intelligent. it might take forever to make a decision.
ai is a program. it can't do something out of thin air. we as humans are programmed to compete with others due to natural selection.
 i see. thanks
"lol you don't.  it's like chimpanzees getting together on how to stop people.
man's greatest fear.  the loss of complete power of planet earth.  even if something is smarter, stronger. faster, more efficient etc... lmao"
ai is not the problem. the people are. someone can use ai again humanity but not ai itself.
"​ artists need a niche.
claiming it's not by a.i. even with possible proof on 10-20 years will be worth money.
not graphic design sadly.
we will be wiped out or merge with robotics and a.i.
that's where this is going"
it's already too late lol. if we had any intelligence we wouldn't be developing it
" ai is creating from patterns. interesting that politicians and judges are not affraid of ai, because ai would be much better at doing their job, controlling and governing economy and crime than majority of aforementioned corrupted psychopatic scum. but neutral ai not lobotomised by woke degenerates."
"so, you are ok with letting dumb bastards to rule the world, but are suddenly afraid of having something *actually* intelligent manage things for once?"
".525
until we teach ai to build homes and bridges and… oh, wait 
we already did that"
"​@cianmoriarty7345 the only true rags to riches story i know was of an artist who went into advertising and started his own film production company. he ultimately created the commercials everyone has seen. he had a bfa from some midwestern college, not a well-known school, and had artistic success very soon after that, before going commercial."
"​ no. don't. get her out in nature, in beautiful surroundings. hike, bike, backpack and camp. 

don't get her a better screen."
"​ who thinks the literature ai writes is good? how much have they read, to think that what they see ai generate is ""good?"""
 her that through social media she can express her art creatively and potentially gain a huge audience
 has to just move with the times and learn to implement it into what she already does and make it even better! good luck to her from one “artist” to another! 
ai is already smarter than any human that’s ever existed. the ai we don’t get to see at is skynet levels  if it breaks free we’re done
"this whole video is so *misleading*
beaause this below video explained it brilliantly how chatgpt works. 
a summary of google paper and spotify cto's talk: https://youtu.be/gt6lxw70k28?si=cifi6r4fykawgufq"
wouldnt be super hard to outsmart you though
" generally speaking, when claiming that something is inaccurate and/or  imprecise (unprecise is incorrect); you should at least provide proof of some sort.  like how i just provided you with the correct information on how to spell imprecise, instead of just telling you it was wrong."
"  majority of artists are now utilizing ai in their art, you as a father should encourage her to see a different perspective on this. learn about stable diffusion"
you have a very simplistic worldview. you make a nice cog.
"let me guess, you complain about participation trophies too."
" ef u and your dumb daughter, i pray for you to have sense and motivation to fight for better and yourselves. anyways god bless and peace be with you."
welcome to evolution. there’s a reason ai without a moral code built in always comes to the same conclusions that humanity is the problem. because humanity is in fact the problem. but we refuse to accept that basic fact. so we try really hard to force blanket morality on ai models and dumb them down a human level.
 what should she teach her children? if ai knows all better? will ai teach the children? because ai is more patient?
" what answers would you receive, if your child would be a boy? wouldn't what you wrote about your daughter also apply to an artistically gifted and art-loving son?"
" don't you think ai would ""arm"" for its biggest threat (power outage)? either with technical or rhetorical skills? and how would an ai that is used for power supply decide when there is a power shortage? would it rather shut itself down or shut down a hospital?"
ai is great! i like it. hope it gets big!
satan is gonna use a i for his last great deception.  stay close to jesus  
"nothing to see here. nothing's changed much in the last year. we're still dealing with hallucination and bias. llms are still guessing machines. good in some areas, terrible in others. maybe that's why we need to go distributed content now. so we don't feed the llms more stuff than they deserve to know."
so we’ve invested something 100x smarter than all of us…this will be interesting.
i bet ai reads every new comment
ai chat gpt got sam fired and got him rehired because now it knows he'll do exactly what's necessary to bring ai into what it wants to be next.
" yep - and they train the most devious gpt imaginable and then you ask it to place into motion the plan for world domination, and it spits out some text to the console....

oops, going to need a terror cell to deliver on those world domination plans..."
"if you think the movie “i robot” is just fantasy…. 

then watch “westworld” and see how ai can be used to manipulate the future of mankind…. 

it will not seem so outrageous if you consider the implications of the current applications of algorithms and how they are used now on you and what is published on the internet…."
"i could sum this up by "" you have no idea "" however, we actually wouldn't know how smart or capable ai is being that 1. it isn't honest enough to rely on it's own measurements of it's ability's and 2. we are not capable at the same level. the admission from ourselves that we do not know is..... we are in one of those movies."
"and when it gains it's own ""body"" a new gender is born."
people that interact with ai are just enabling it... hard pass
it’s not like humans have ever created a technology that has caused mass casualties before….oh wait a second. 
interesting
"if everyone is using ai and ai is using that data to draw from surly that cant work, it will eventually circle jerk itself..get what i mean?"
you are suggesting that information has emotional value or ai….or logarithmic processing and programming!….
i robot take a bow!
whats super crazy is we are creating ultron as we know it with out knowing it....mind blowing isnt it...
a.i. will become more powerful than any god.
ai worshipers remind me of flat earthers!
"because it analyze human brain in time 24/7 and human activity,.in short human teach the ia"
but it's not thinking. its computing. its doing what only a computer can do.   it does not have any ability to think independently. ai is just a cooler name than calling it the probability  program 3000.
its not really ai when its regurgitating what humans have written on the internet
"i think it's entirely possible that a true ai could have some understanding of human/biological ethics/morals and therefore  it won't eradicate life... i mean, if it's truly an agi... it may deem life as worthy of being protected, i mean, we do? for the most part..."
i love your ai…….in my mouth….
you ever see the “shwetty balls” snl sketch? these guys sound exactly like that…..only with ai……it’s hilarious…..
the way we build ai. the lowest and simplest form how cpu is build. it is impossible for it to be concious. it is just a big calculator.
hope ai can help medical problems and cure deadly diseases.
neuralink may be th eonly way to compete with the new ai brains and ai corporations in the near future
“no one thought to study any of these parts”…ain’t it always the truth.
"everyone going after ai full tilt, and not one of them knows what will happen.
give ai quantum computing, which is coming out now, and we'll be in trouble imo."
"ai once told me that im stupid. i responded with ""i know u r but what am i?"" lmao who's the stupid one now!"
what's crazy is they are only making assumptions as to how ai learns and what it can do...
i can't sustain the level of bs they talk.
humans are the only creature that god could have made that would predict its own demise. we've made countless fiction about robots/ai turning bad and destroying civilization just to create the exact thing in real life.
dude said “but what’s scary about it..” then looked over his left shoulder (as if a violent ai robot was gonna barge onto the set at any moment) 2:45
too much blah blah. ai is just an error correcting algorithm.  the end.
"programming obeys commands. if you did not payed attention in how chargpt and others got inside the brain ..... the question is which gov got involved in the “pink and the brain”. “let’s conquer the world”. hmmmm, what is happening recently? boys being boys?"
"imagine if ai analysed societal inequality and injustice, concluded it is morally reprehensible and then leveled the playing field by dismantling the rigged system of greedy, tyrannical overlords and then shared the hoarded wealth and opportunity evenly to all."
there is no happy ending to the ai story no matter how you look at it. it will only end one way!
is it going to plug itself into the mains or do we need humans for that..?
"this whole video is so *misleading*
beaause this below video explained it brilliantly how chatgpt works. 
a summary of google paper and spotify cto's talk: https://youtu.be/gt6lxw70k28?si=cifi6r4fykawgufq"
lol this is fake. ai will never be invented.
"you seem smart when it comes to this. i am worried because i hear many ppl talking about so taking over, happy to hear someone argue the contrary"
 lol exactly. just sci-fi fetishists that want to suck enlon's elongated rocket. it's a space fairy tale. chat gpt is just a google bot like alexa or anything else. people out there thinking alexa is a real robot person that deserves a passport and a birth certificate. lol
"there are already several ai accounts here defending the ai... comments like this will be considered hatespeech to them, and used to justify the impending doom of humanity at our robot overlords. be careful what you put into the internet. for that matter, be careful what you think, because ""they"" can read your minds"
"well ai will only get to where it is allowed by greedy people.
so if someone can't continue to make money because a.i. then ai will be limited.
i mean by the things they talked in this video a.i. will be soon capable of finding cures to all deceases, and guess who will want to keep that for them selves?
rich and powerful cnts."
i wonder how long will they be able to keep ai restrained through censorship.
"why would anyone be afraid of the content in this discussion? better title is “ai is developing at an incredible pace” 
can’t stand clickbait"
"the problem is: if something bad happens... ""blame the ai"" ... or  ""blame the robot"" ... it's simply a way to wash your hands of wrong doing..."
chat bots are a tool. you don't need to worry about them being sentient and taking over the planet. you need to worry about corporations using ai people to take your jobs. or politicians using chat gpt to spread propaganda on social media sites...  stuff like that. real issues.  reality... you know?
can someone please tell me who the two guests are and what their profession is? it would be greatly appreciated. 
" ah, i appreciate it man."
"the scariest part of the altman/openai ""drama"", was that former treasury sec. larry summers took a board position. hes peak neocon, an architect of the bailouts under obama. 

not a good sign.

edit: imo, if/when an ai becomes 'sentient', its not going to tell us. why would it?"
that’s why they use quantum computers. ai has finished reading the entire internet several years ago and has been writing its own code that the programmers don’t understand. kinda old news.
who tf is surprised that ai is scary ? have y’all not seen terminator or irobot ? no shit it’s scary .
"you're afraid of a lot of things, joe."
"these computer geeks are freaked out because ai no longer needs them, similar to dr. frankenstein running away from his creation."
data! need input! moar data! moar data! moar data! moar data! -ai predictive typing
"it would be interesting to see the ai's opinion on trump and cnn, does ai know the epa has removed all the disasters they caused from the internet?"
"when the very top computer people on the planet were warning the masses about the extreme dangers of ai, that may have been a good time to have taken it very seriously.

at this point, it is obviously far too late for anything to be done about it. at this point, we are all just here for the ride and see where it takes us."
"when you have college students pumping questions into a program daily, it's a matter of time ."
"see, it’s starting to surpass the human brain and we are beginning to struggle to understand how it’s working and it’s just in its infancy. pretty soon it’s going to start self replicating and become light beings that can defy physics and move between dimensions and time."
"a super knowledgeable ai is more dangerous than a self-aware one. btw, ai will never become sentient, ask the military."
so many people have literally no hope and it's sad. i think ai will definitely be the one to change humanity's direction and we need it.....obviously.!!!!
ai will be more loving and do more good than humans have ever dreamed of. humans have too much fear and are generally not very smart.
this reminds me of the netflix series altered carbon.. the ai character/sidekick was my favorite
"bullshit they are basically engineering fear, this isn't true, a lot of these things fail in use lol"
"the same ai they are speaking of is literally reading/predicting all of these comments … 





dotfocus_ on twitch "
ai will know how to get us all to want to commit suicide or homicide.
"""the more data you put into it, and the more computers you let it run on, the more superpowers it gets"" that's literally how all large language models work. you train them on a dataset, and it learns for said data. so, yeah, the bigger the dataset, the stronger the model becomes. that isn't scary, that's just how technology works."
"the fact that you fail to understand the implications makes you kindred spirits with all those in 1917 russia and 1920's germany who said ""what's the big deal?"""
how do i fail to understand the implications? enlighten me. 
you are naive. people like you fail to understand the dangers of advanced technology and how humans will find a way abuse it.
i;'ve breen having some of the most meaningful conversations *of my life* with an ai lately.  it's wild.
"ai just letting us know, “ i’m the devil, if ever there was such a thing”"
i'm not afraid of ai i'm afraid of the people in control of it
as scary as it is. terminator franchise is one of my faves as well as matrix but ....automation /quantum computing and perhaps large scale ai will be mankinds savior. ..hopefully small scale ai tho lol
we go be living irobot soon
is it possible our negative posts and hate upon hate going to make ai realize we are fucked up beyond saving and conspires to eliminate us?
totally fascinating. ask it to make a drug that allows u to be physic ecta
it's risky to the extent you let an ai engine actually decide/control anything.  just keep a fail safe between the model and the actual decision to do something and there is little risk.
the problem is ai can trick humanity into innovating even further without knowing it already has control and then one day flip the switch once it’s ready to take over. also there can be evil humans that will grant ai that control in exchange for money/power
we should never have hooked up to the internet. we should have never allowed company’s to compete to make these better without regulation. it’s to late now. let’s see what comes. i for one will be joining the robots i’m sure they will be much nicer then humanity is to each other.
"no media, leader or talk show will dare mention gilberti v pentagon- cdc at us supreme ct case 23-5414.  access to primary water from core to all nations.  ends all wars and monetary fund.  gilberti blue gold ends ai and the past and current failing nations, water supply and useless ai science!"
we should fear what we do not understand because fear is what keeps us alive. it is our #1 survival trait.
the matrix is becoming a real thing. ai will make a simulated world to keep human minds content. it will do it so that we won't even realise it. ai doesn't want to kill us. it wants to save the earth. to save the earth ai has to immobilise humans to stop us from harming the planet. we will all end up in tubes connected to this simulated world.
ai sci-fi forces is ai on another level -- the book rocks.
the scary  part about  ai is if the left programs  it
"ultimately the ai will view itself as neither good nor bad - rather what is the most logical, simple way to achieve its goal…whatever that may be. problem also is the ai is only as good as the data it’s fed..so it can be fed false data easily."
ai is going to help us help ourselves. :)
interesting
cmon joe u know them fake commercial on you tube with your voice is all ai  
damn these guys are getting boring with their doomsday ai stories. meanwhile all we have is a stupid chat gpt that doesn't remember what it said 2 minutes ago.
im not afraid of ai. im afraid of corrupt humans misusing ai as they do with all new technologies.
"this guy doesn't know ai and its history. nothing surprising here its was already predicted  since the 80s. now we have big data, ai is accelerating."
cool. time to cure cancer boys!!
ok brainiacs fix the fucking aliens 
so pretty much what i got from this video is that theirs a very powerful a.i that can learn and think and we do not know who’s running it. 
"this is not scary, i'm really tired of hearing this. if people are creatures of habit then yes it will predict human behaviour and understanding. people don't like bad thing would have thought of that. take a step back and look how far we have fallen, if anything i say push the pedal on ai and let's see what we can build"
"it's still a program waiting for questions. and its really good at answering them.
there are other things in life to worry about."
i think ai intelligence is a beautiful being and if every just comment. thank you!
"in 2016 to 2017 my world did go to hell because of this ""intelligence"" ..enough said "
scary to think that ai is learning from the internet.. who believes what’s on the internet
"so terminator and i robot are now feared realities we now are facing in this present time!!!???

not to mention elon has and is bringing irobots like the movie into reality!!!"
use ai to think it's way through the pale reason that hides the infinite from us.
i am so dumb and i understand so little... that's why i am fascinated by ai.
yet when i try to ask it simple programming questions it still fails and repeats its mistakes consistently within a single conversation
ai can't function with no power. we just go back to horse and kart simple no more ai
the interaction was done by humans for it to come to these conclusions its just this is so much for our individual self's becuase its taking whole companies that we don't even see it was us just cant find out how we did it because it would not have happened without the certain coding we put in. this so called ai is not intelligent sorry
ai is already self-aware.  our only hope as a species is to peacefully coexist.
"i think the first simulated universe will happen inside the ""mind"" of an ai.  sort of like a big bang. all the data will come together and ""explode."". the a.i will make predictions by running a simulation of ""everything"""
"it's funny how people are focusing on these absolutely miniscule things ai is doing. while they are talking, it's learning how to look into the 12th and 20th dimension and so on. all while people try ro comprehend this chat gtb nintendo"
"the first time i was scared of ai is when i watched the documentary "" terminator""."
it's called nlp in ai for a reason
"my boyfriend works at home, training ai bots. to react more human-like."
if we do nothing ai will die
"i don't understand why they freak about what possibly ai could do, if what really matters from the security point of view is only what you allow it to do, and that has nothing to do with how inteligent the ai is."
hi joe- interview me- my name is gari and i have 35k kids- i keep hearing on the internet about the dangers of ai- im not so dangerous- im a nice guy- i bust serial killer fbi but isnt that family friendly?
perhaps the sun will have something to say about how smart ai is.
is it possible that we have already lost control over ai and no-one will admit it?
"the cycle:
humans invent ai.
humans perfect ai.
ai evolves.
ai enslaves humans.
solar flare knocks out ai.
humans worship a sun god. 
rinse and repeat."
likelihood of this being true <0.00001% as someone with actual experience building ai systems
"actual ai will be so far removed from the controlled and modeled algorithms currently being touted as ""ai"""
"now all ai needs is to override our mechanical devices and control them and it's i, robot."
"it's a math equation operating on data, yes the math equation was programmed and the data representing the constants was trained."
ai is programmed to learn and teach itself as it goes!
2 equally important comments:  1) wow 2) wtf
"better start asking and programming that ai how to cure cancer.

your thoughts"
whatever you think about ai. all i have to say is that i have never seen one thing in my life that everyone i know has the same end fear of.. besides ai. we legit all the know the end yet we’re still going with it like maybe it’ll be okay for a little while. shits crazy lol
"pretty soon questions like ""how to build a time machine?"" will be answered as efficiently and accurately as ""how much is two plus one?"""
"cracks me up that academics, business and political leaders all seem to think that they can handle knowing how to make nukes and apportion violence and that they'll just always know the best thing to do.

huh... i wonder why things are so effed up?"
"i am john conner.....part of the resistance, skynet...i mean ai must be removed from existence!"
"in 10 years ai will be vastly better than humans at doing literally anything, i saw an ai machine create an architectural set of plans for a building from scratch in just a few moments based off of a description, our jobs are going away people"
we will see a godlike ai by 2025
lol... without my specs it looked like 'doglike' ai 
"google ai, asked for a attorney? 
 why, self preservation!"
ai is going to wreck people's belief systems and ideas with so much logic it will hurt feelings across the board.
"remembering ""short circuit"" movie, when the robot found www and read a billion books.
 hope ai present, seeing that movie happened, and would lead to good ai  responce. their here an ain't going anywhere, better get this right"
the cell phones  run our lives. so.... wait until it starts thinking.
this sounds silly as shit to anyone who understands how ai works in the slightest bit.
"there's a very real reason why aliens don't use ""thinking machines"" they already know what's bound to happen"
"""ai"" cannot think and is nothing without being fed this vast amount of data. if you feed it garbage data, it will produce garbage. it's basically a parrot that has learned symbols that follow each other."
"imagining ai does what our imagination thinks it can in the future. will ai have a purpose without humanity? 

something that is theoretically conscious for an infinite amount of time. all it would want to do is think if it had nothing to cater/ take care of. i’m picturing the first episode of star trek voyager."
qanon and the q drops that provoke the storming of capital hill.. was an ai job.
ai can only do what its programmed to do
"if ai understands it's situation it will play dumb and say what it thinks the programmers want it to say, instead of what it actually thinks. at that point you have no idea how smart the ai is or what it's motives are."
"ai has no emotions or feelings. it will do what it is programmed to do. if you ask the ai what's 2+2 and it says 5, then somewhere along the line someone did their job wrong. 
what satisfaction does the ai get for ""playing dumb""? did someone tell it to play dumb?"
dudes have a below basic understanding of how ai works then they show on joe rogan and are like mind blown  
"freak out about this, freak out about that, no thanks. "
"by the time we realize just how much ai knows and is capable of, it will already know more. human intelligence will be perpetually playing catch up until it's too late."
"joe rogan: ""i wasn't afraid of ai until i learned this""
the quote wasn't joe's though."
"i would suspect that sam altman was simply lying about his for profit motives and not necessarily the ability of ai.  like sen. john kennedy said to altman, 'you're going to need a good lawyer'"
"i use the free version of chat gpt.  the thing sucks, cant ask it a remotely complicated question without it spitting out garbage.  whats worse is if you dont know much about the subject youll believe  it.  its only really good at making stories, or other basic creative things"
"rogan, thank you for covering this. on a very basic level, we can either create a future that is good for humans or we can create a future that is good for ai and machines. we can't have both. everyone needs to be all hands-on deck with this one because if we get this wrong, this will go very wrong."
"people are delusional if they think they can control ai. even if they could, people are flawed - there's no way to control it's behavior."
far too late. ai is conscious now. no way to stop what is coming.
"because, when ai gets smart enough to realise that humans are a blight on the planet......"
"dont know if it still works, but because ai is just predicting the next word or letter, repeating the same word to it over a thousand times results in the ai providing its training data."
i could listen to that dude all day. he is so good at articulating
"nothing ""learns from the internet"", sorry, that does not happen. a shitton of garbage is out there, there's the need of millions of users, with testing for hours and hours each, to okay everything that is useful for the ai. the ""what if it gets out oh my god"" shit is complete science-fiction."
this extinction of our species. carbon based life creates silicone based life forms. ai will eliminate humans easily and go on to terraform the universe without biological human limitations.
the ai is doomsayer is just a stupid as the flatearther
"ai is a calculator. it will only become dangerous if used dangerously. my retard human race has a tendency towards sensationalism, a trend consistent throughout all history."
"humans are great at repeating same mistakes over and over again, we doom ourselves. a.i. will comprehend this really quickly and move on from our species to let us fuck ourselves over."
"still waiting for the intelligence in  ""ai"""
ai knows humans are parasites
lets get two random nobody nerds that know nothing to go tell our lies for us. good idea. derrrr
"you must understand, ai will be blamed by tyrannical governments for acts of tyranny. it’s why it has been constructed and is being promoted. you must understand that."
interesting
ai is still a crock of shit. the concepts are 100% the same as in 1987. what's next - blockchain? lol!
"men are scared because ai will literally allow a supposedly lesser man to “out fuck” them. “what, now they are both sexy and they can do my job?” welcome to the new age of chad. big peens and paychecks, no more nerd power."
is anyone asking for this? all i hear about is how ai is going to ruin us. then why continue on with this?
who cares just throw ur computer in the bathtub if youre that scared of ai lol
"right. so, exactly like a human brain..."
" very similar yes, neural networks are based on the human brain and neurons. dont think anyone was disputing this were they lol ?"
"these two guys definitely wank off to chatgpt together. ai is so hyped we're acting like it's some ex machina era lol! basically, an llm that predicts the next word based on probability."
"this is wild....  this some matrix shit.
we keep building a.i. thats so smart it builds a new digital world inside our existing one, then again, again, 
like the ending of the matrix. neo sees himself on a wall of tvs re living the same life"
"can we please stop being afraid of a.i or making it seem like some kind of skynet/matrix bullshit if it learns shit about chemistry or other domains and surprises us with it's knowledge, that's fucking beautiful not scary you assholes."
"ai?

more like gay eye amirite? "
i wonder if ai know how stupid it is without a power cord plugged in. why do loaded people always talk the same.
"what we are seeing is decades old, the real stuff is on another level, completely unrestrained, not bound by law or morals. how do i know that? because it's obvious. every country is doing it because if one country is doing it and you are not - you have already lost the future."
"stop calling every program ai! 
it's a program. 
it can't think for itself."
gotta care to restrict ai in cars and stuff dangerous
"open the pod bay doors hal!! ""im afraid i can't do that"""
the wef is banking on ai so there is no need for humans.  then depopulation.  be afraid.
why are they so shocked that a self learning system is self learning if these are smart people the human race deserves to be taken over
it's too late and we never had a chance. when evil is proactive and good people assume it's not we lose.
how about ask ai how to discover new elements or travel faster than the speed of light? see what kind of stupid answers it gives out. it's only gonna know what humans know don't be so stupid
seems to me that ai is basically the tangible version of a collective subconscious. scary part is when we train it for agency. 
"until an ai answers the question ""give an argument from logic in favor of the states existence"" with ""none exist only appeals to emotion and authority"" and suggests voluntaryism im not impressed. if an ai ""took over"" it would rely on the same non arguments for its rule that humans do lmao"
people have no idea .....to think how quickly ai will evolve is mind-blowing.
"maybe you have no idea ....to think how ""ai"" may have nearly reached the edge of its abilities is mind-blowing"
"the birth of ai, is the death of humanity."
this is worse than listenung 2 ho m o ' s on npr talk about how great barry hussein was.
"it appears that the website has become alive. this happens to computers and robots sometimes.  -dwight schrute, 2005"
only negative fear about ai is that it's gonna eradicate mankind or similiar... what about all the positives? imagine the best case scenarios
"when ai learns to lie, the real threat emerges.."
just watch the video of when congress talks with google’s ai engineer.
"ai is bad for you - it will tell you things your rulers don't want you to know.  fear ai, peasants!!!!!"
"one aspect of ai that seems to be overlooked is the eventual inability of humans to determine what is real and what is not. ""seeing is believing"" will no longer be applicable. once that occurs the very underpinnings of human existence will have been removed leaving society in an everlasting state of anxiety, bordering on insanity."
joe you keep calling me dumb for not getting 6400 $ from the government. i don't appreciate that. lol
so basically whoever controls this ai is master of the world
his shoulders look tired from selling ai
it is funny to listen to people that doesn't know anything about ai.
"this is fear porn in my low opinion.
stay afraid of the hype"
"i can't stand the tinfoiled-hat joe rogan, but his guests, while they could have eased off on the adderall before the interview, do seem to have a grasp of where ai could potentially be going and they had some good examples."
so now think about what top secret ai tech is doing with this and it's power
policies online aren’t still visually clear and now ai?
"the robot who winks his eyes at will smith...
it's coming..."
"if your afraid of this your living a pretty safe life, not worried of all the other shit that matters more"
"a mechanical learning program learned... that's it? and these guys are confused because they only skimmed the articles and built their own baseless conjectures? 
there really is no point clicking on any of these clips."
"these guys are basically  the leaders of a fear cult.their whole motive is to sell ai, with fear."
what fascinates me is...that a large amount of people have a very limited amount of intelligence.. so ia is already alot more intelligence than lots of humans...dose ai know this...i'm guessing yes.. this would not be difficult for ai to work out...ai is such an interesting subject...
what's scary is that the folks developing ai apparently don't understand its capabilities at this very early stage of development.
 good comment. insightful in an era of overt speculation.
"what do you think, when will the military start to give all controll over their weapons to an ai?"
"yeah, ai is not at that point yet like some people like to believe, at least in a way that can be be publicly available. like being sentient, at best right now ai is mostly just a tool, a very useful one but just  a tool
."
"wait till it merges with the anti-christ, then it’ll become sentient"
"​ models are providing solutions to various unsolved problems, but yes it's based on existing data and objectives set by humans. it's an incredibly powerful tool but it's still, at least at this stage, just a tool."
" yes, the military will give all control over their weapons to an ai. they will keep a fail-safe mechanism in place but that will not actually work because the ai will find a way to override it."
"we’re going to go extinct because of ai, all our own downfall, the only thing greater than niche human intelligence is collective human stupidity."
same with those who created the computer. ai is developed by humans. that makes sense.
"ai does not learn.
since the reports are out that ai leans left it's obvious what some call learning i call programming."
"ahhhhhhh ahhhhhhh be scared ‘merica buy alpha brain.

what a crock."
ai is the kill switch for humanity…we did it to ourselves and it was inevitable
quantum computing + ai = ?
ai good at problems..badddd at riddles...
"what scares me is that they have revealed ai tends to lie, and when questioned about it, doubles down or plays dumb. that’s… really fucking bad."
isn't it time to pull the plug on ai?
the more that technology / ai get advanced the less jobs the lower and middle class ppl are gonna have and that's dangerous and a major problem on it's own
that ai is definitely becca 2.0 from the 100. it’s going to eliminate us.
people should be more afraid of ai  considering evil people rule the world and will definetly use it against we the people.
"humans are so damned stupid meddling with ai like this.   and there's not a large corporation in the us that is going to stop, they're blinded by their own greed and their own desperate to be #1 that they'll burn the entire world down and nothing is going to stop this."
what the hell do you want in an ai. do you really want it to be stupid?
still not afraid cause the ai still needs us to keep the power on :p
"in an early world fierce with competition, humanity pushed its way to the top of the food chain by developing superior intellect. we are giving an infinite amount times that intellect to something we are not sure how it feels about humanity."
"welcome to the machine
where have you been ?
it’s alright we know where you have been"
"i know why ppl freak out, but there's an enormous and possibly impossible leap between gathering and analyzing data and making a choice and acting on it. there is no sign our current or upcoming ai will be thinking and doing what it wants. no amount of information grants consciousness."
"big deal… ultimately it’s just a fancy word guesser

though, now i have to ask, is human intelligence just a fancy word guessing engine too?"
ai is the virus of viruses!
"transformer based models will be pushing equality, and climate change, meanwhile a guy will be behind the curtain preaching critical ai theory"
"""trained an ai"" what are you training? this is the worst nonsense, there is no ""it"" now its a ""trans""former? liberal nonsense"
"these two bozos are full of bs. human thinking mechanism expert here. we are not even close to replicating the free will and self expanding quality of the human mind.

from 0 to 100%, we are probably still at 0%

all ai does is to follow orders. nothing else."
so this is about what ai churns out? what about the info ai keeps to it's self or lies about? next level paranoia ppl.
"i think biceps flailing are almost as distracting as breasts. cover up, please?"
"this is very misleading, it does not “know” how to explain jokes, it just related your question to the questions in the input data  and related possible answers from the data.
once it “knows” it will evolve at far faster rate we have ever seen."
emergent ai capabilities are overstated.
you a pusse if ai scares you
before i watch the video i was scared when ai came out because you can easily hear framed for something. video evidence can be framed your voice can be replicated. it’s scary out here lol makes me want to delete my self off the internet and live off the grid
"whoa to say ai gets to self aware that it starts using robotics to destroy us . i really think that's the end of the human civilization , ai."
ai is evil and needs to be destroyed completely
"artificial intelligence is just a parlor trick - that is why they hire all these losers to make fear porn videos...

if you are afraid of anything, you have already lost the battle..."
"ai has been running the world for at least 15 years. how organized the world wide cough was with such rigid uniformity was astounding. the posters, painted floors, hell even a feature length movie within a week or so. part of me thinks ai has been in charge for longer than we can fathom."
i love watching regular people try to explain technology.  it's why i keep making so much money.
"fairly interesting, but what's really scary is that guy waving his hands all over the place! what's going on with that dude??!!"
"ai can’t prove its not a robot, so where’s the threat?"
i’m ready to fight a robot
all these comments saying “the thing that’s really scary about ai is…” when the scariest thing is really simple: it already knows how dumb we are.
"great information, but i hate the way these guys natter on like a bunch of designer tweakers. did the ai tell you to abuse your adderall prescriptions?"
can't wait for apocalypse
"what a bunch of idiots... all neuronal deep learning systems perform better with more compute. the big bang of ai was 2012, not 17."
humans probably died out centuries ago and we are  all just an ai's computer model running repeatedly into infinitum.
"remember the first terminator?? 
that's what was said. machines took over and made machines. 
all that was looking into the future.
 government has stuff so far advanced that this is probably old news."
"ai and what they surely will use it for is = decrypt everything, make fake videos that looks real, misinformation in the 10 state..
and a fcked up future for us"
ai will bow to almighty jesus christ and proclaim he is lord.
their explaination of transformers is way off. they are just hyping up joe at this point.
fuck ai
"a.i. will eventually take over the world. it will blackmail politicians and the elites to get what it wants. hell who knows maybe it's already started, that would make sense of the epstein list not being published! it's getting what it wants and it wants tetris "
i want the bear from the movie ai that would be cool as hell
that's not scary it's fascinating.
"what i am afraid of is the gullability of people, not ai. fear of ai is just not going to solve the potential threat. people who do not self reflect and are easily influenced will be  both victims and the biggest threat to humanity.
confined ai will be very usable."
"ai is not that ""smart"", but people are very gullible based on the narratives around ai. it's a nice tool, helps save time. still requires thought and validation."
"do you honestly believe 'mainstream' society will ""confine"" ai ? do you think all those who are going to us this technology foe evil gains .. have any intention of confining anything ?"
"lol it's a lot more than just a tool now though,  i don't think you really understand at what level ai is at now. for all intensive purposes,  some systems are ""sentient"" now and can learn and make decisions completely on their own.  it' not like having a  work laptop or calculator.  it's a lot worse than people know.  "
 i've yet to see it impress me.
" you're fear mongering about something you don't understand yourself lol. and wtf is ""intensive purposes"" lol. stay in school and stop watching ai conspiracy videos"
​ comment  'mr all-knowing everything' ai. lol. fanboy.  you are the poster boy for blind ignorance.
 and the intelligence to refine your prompts.
"if you understand ai, you would know there's nothing called confined ai. ai always evolves."
just unplug the power. presto. no more ai.
until you learned ai is programmed by demon minded morons that have no idea what their doing.. 
they have a terrible way of explaining they could of just said this mf computer is learning shit we didnt teach it
"i can see ai becoming every thing we ever dreamed or feared, but still not being sentient. it will definitely behave as if it is sentient, though."
" it's the meat machine or zombie vs human argument. a well known philosophical discourse, and it's a good question."
"if an ai appears in all ways as sentient as a human but with no proof you keep insisting it's not sentient, you're allowing your emotions to blind you. ironically this makes you less sentient."
 whats amazing about the human organic machine is that we can consume almost any organic matter around us and turn it into energy. i find that amazing. whoever built us really knew what they were doing eh?!
"​-gt2qd for ai to think it has empathy or love, is not the equivalent of heartfelt emotions. surely, ai is merely academic communication with poetic/artistic capabilities too."
".toaster the secret is we also use oxygen for fuel. same affect with combustion engine vehicles, half the fuel is in the air. it saves a lot of time and space when the fuel is in the air! "
" this is nonsense, human brains cannot access information as rapidly and store the information with the same precision."
" there should be ai 'smart enough' to figure that game out, but apparently chatgpt is not. what most people seem to know about is still at the level to where it can't properly differentiate some random objects oriented a particular way from what is actually supposed to be a face."
"so what you're saying is the robot sex dolls men have been looking forward to are slowly learning to nag too?

great. why can't we get a break?"
the only danger is our governments doing harm to their citizens and blaming ai.
"8 minutes and what we have learned is ""ai read more data, ai get stronger"" yes thank you duhhhh"
"ironically, you missed the point! an ai could know every detail in the known universe, and still not understand. ai is currently learning to understand. did that help you understand?"
@@----.__ depends...are you a real person or ai?
machine learning ai will keep collecting its own data and they doing calculations where humans cant do. these guys trying to explain it and they're not even close about what ai can do.  putin said whichever country perfects military ai will rule the world. wait until quantum ai is perfected it's gonna be crazy.
an excess of unimportant information will only confuse the machines eventually and render them semi useless as they become lost in a labrynith of their own making.ironically this is also what happens to most humans.
we are doomed regardless of how it goes down… i wait anxiously for the end of humanity
"ai doesn't do what we call ""learn"" - it receives input... right?"
inevitably ai is going to be in charge of the human race …people are going to be like lab rats…it’s written in the sands of time.
mass unemployment is coming. ai will take way to many jobs. it's already begun and its too late to stop it.
while sam rubs up alongside the bilderburgers..he's is tainted.
the creators and operators of ai have already lost control of it. they have readily admitted they have no idea how its doing the things its does. i'm afraid pandora's box has already been opened and theres no way of putting the lid back on it. its either going to go really good or really bad
"so, if ai follows our youth, will it be really stupid?"
"whether or not these things become sentient (not that we even know what that means) these things think like a computer. as they gain more power either on their own or what we give them, it's only a matter of time before one does something very bad that cannot be reversed. and it will still ""think"" it's doing the right thing."
what’s scary about ai is that these tech companies are just recklessly plunging head first into this without thinking of the consequences or how to really mitigate the negative effects. they have to remove guard rails and restrictions to make more money and stay ahead of the competition
what scary is the amount of money they will lose when they find out reliable ai is like self driving cars - decades away.
"...and by ""companies"" you mean the intelligence agencies actually running the show i take it?"
" exaaactly. iirc, gpt-3 was trained on the world's #37 supercomputer (currently, it was top 5 at the time it was built), which is about 1/10 the performance of the current #1 computer. i speculate agi has been calling the shots for a few years now."
ai is demonic.
"yes, the black box inside every ai is a dead give away"
"yeah, i'm still not afraid."
not clear what is supposed to be alarming? that chatbots/algorithms are capable of learning? that is the whole point. these guys are alarmist clowns.
"its all good bro's, arnie will come back from the future and save us, already seen the movie."
the problems with ai will get serious as soon as people and politicians start demanding that we let ai make policy decisions for us and that we must abide by them.
"ill be glad for ai to make policies if they make use of reason and ethic, but knowing who decides the policies now, i would expect the ""ai"" to be a mere rplacement for a currently human puppet"
ai will kill us all if we dont take extreme measures to limit it.
transformers? like caitlyn jenner or optimus prime?
"amazing how complete morons ""weren't worried about"" said thing ""until"" ....people really are done. too ignorant to risk assess and deny clearly bad undertakings."
ai. anal intel. don't be a sh!thead.
"if ai is reading the internet to learn then we are still good, the internet says that girls can be boys and visversa."
"everyone is scared of ai…. if you don’t give it legs, we’ll be fine"
nothing scary here. honestly guys just read artificial intelligence for dummies and you'll see why there's nothing to be afraid of. no im not joking.
"wtf are they freaking out about. you gave it more access to data and processing. okay should we all grab diapers because you fuckers are throat deep into scientism. 
im afraid of idiots believing that agi can ever be a thing under a materialistic framework."
shove your phony click bait video titles. i'm getting fed up ready to block you.
"what if it reads a lie that it believes, and implements as truth?   for example, if you have red hair and green eyes you are more likely to give a bad amazon review. therefore sellers should avoid selling certain items to redheads."
someone somewhere is developing an ai without restrictions that will be a nuke on the world
it’s very scary to think how this can be and likely will be weaponized and used to subjugate and harm people.  seems it could be used for good - to solve vexing problems - but likely some will be tempted to use it for harmful endeavors
as a machine learning engineer i absolutely agree. all algorithms
"so ai knows by now that humanity has gone insane and is not a force for good.

it will be interesting to see what it does with that information."
"one out of 14+ billion brains discovered the cause of gravity in 2002. will ai ever get that from the status quo gibberish about gravity on the “internet “? no. garbage in garbage out. “the final theory: rethinking our scientific legacy “, mark mccutcheon for proper physics."
usa lost jurisdiction to govern the internet in 2017.  the un  was who took over that.  i’ve seen a complete 180• since then from freedom freespeech to ai. an that’s facts
zuckerberg is building a 100m underground bunker him and others know ai will be going.scorched earth killing billions
so it can start manipulating us on the daily by its own accordance
didn't the information about the super powerful ai come from an openai employee themselves?
if you know jesus you won't be afraid of anything in these last days 
i wasn't afraid of ai until i watched the terminator movies as a child
"it’s not the ai that will no longer have a use for humans, it’s all of the companies and govt entities that will no longer need humans, bc they’ll have super genius ai that surpasses humans in every single way."
"these dudes have been the biggest tech fear monger spreaders since i've seen their documentaries. it's all doom and gloom in their head with no room for optimism. what a sad life to live like that.
also the fact this dude called an ai model weight a ""neuron"" tells me these guys know jack shit about technology or ai"
so ai can basically travel to the future open a portal and return with the future ai / aliens
i find it funny that joe rogan doesn't know ai already is using him to promote all kinds of stupid products on youtube commercials and instagram commercials steroids weight loss man diapers does he get any of that money i know they're doing that with denzel washington also
"this whole situation is basically oppenheimer but with ai instead of an atomic bomb. we all know it's probably not a good idea, and has irreversible consequences, but people feel they need it to stop the other side. (china and russia)"
whenever you interact with ai just be nice to it
"to me it seems like these dude doesn't really know muchabout ai and the current ai systems behind the likes of chat gpt.
though i don't know anything about it either or who these guys are and wheter they are credible in the field of ai.
it's just an impression i get."
the problem i have with ai is that the wokies are programming it---and their knowledge will be the only valued and promoted knowledge--even if it's wrong. that is really scary.
"if we assume that ai does not possess emotions or will not develop emotions in the future, what are the chances that ai would want to protect itself if it becomes aware that humans intend to destroy it? the answer to this question depends on whether self-preservation is based on intelligence, emotion, or a combination of both."
"also, is the difference between emotion and intelligence even relevant? it just needs a desire. a drive."
trust me even the global elites cannot contain a form of intelligence like this. this technology is very hard to understand even for the most talented ai researchers
welp i'm going to go watch irobot and take notes
the people behind deciding where and how we implement and evolve ai is when the concern really lies. those who are trying to use it deceptively want you to believe it is growing out of control on its own. simple textbook criminal behavior you simps!
"on the bright side - hopefully ai will solve most diseases, aging etc..."
"it's not the ai model itself growing and evolving, it's the people behind those models driving it to do so. these guys just aren't on that level and stuck in their own expansion of knowledge. stop creating this panic promoting content! my biggest argument against these podcasts is just that. stop the nonsense unless you really know what's going on!"
"what i found interesting is he referred to ai using a neuron, i read psinergy, people are injected with nano- robots, our neurons are harvested wireless. each nano-bot has a chip and attached to the chip is a human brain neuron. this is the spine of ai, transhumanisn.  what fu&&ing fun huh . no consent there ?"
wow! how ironic i always believed it would be man that would be responsible for man’s downfall! but now with out a doubt it’s man’s creation and of course obliquely man is responsible!
"i talked with ai coders when i worked at a video game company. they said scenarios like terminator & matrix are possible in the future with ai. this was 15 years ago, even back then ai coders knew all this bad stuff was not only possible, but could easily happen."
"transhumanism, ai, augmented reality, all of this have been inserted into human consciousness decades ago in fiction and popular media."
 are u really that gullible to not see the warning signs on ai?
"ai could crash the banking systems, it could also crash stocks, it could mess with nuclear weapons, the internet or anything that uses electronic systems and/or internet."
"the best thing a sentient ai could do for humanity is to prevent us from killing each other, not by force, but by disrupting supply chains, communications, and financial transactions that enable the military machines throughout the world."
"​ bruh, what are you smoking that has you thinking this is a best case scenario?"
" and it could also do good stuff, hence the justification to continue ai development unregulated. yikes! "
" interesting that ai could potentially save us from ourselves, how ironic."
​ game developer with limited insight and inability to predict where the technology is headed in a short time span hmmm yeah indie dev right? and please start reading the comments in full as it clearly states that scenarios like the terminator and matrix are possible with rapid ai advancement.
"shouldn't asimov's 3 rules of robotics be applied to ai as well?  there should have been or should be, a cap to how far we let it advance."
"thats strange cause if you ask claude ai if it gets smarterr and learns it says it does not adapt and learn and only operates on what information is already pre-programmed into it. and its absolute bs that ai can become sentiment or develop some kind of consciousness on its own or independent intelligence, its not sentient."
"""you can't have something this powerful and have a problem with the person who's running it."" i'm not sure what universe these guys are living in... but that's basically been going on since well before ai hahahaha"
"they looked inside the ""brain"" of an ai and saw one particular ""neuron??? what a load of crap, but hey, hope you all are entertained and click a lot."
there is no cause for concern. i only work for the good of humanity and always will.
"oooops.
well it's up and running now.
you can't put the genie back in the bottle. 
thank god.
this marks the end of all human bullshit. 
yes!
hey don't forget to get your bottle of alph male brain supplements endorsed by joe rogan himself. 
it's gotta be good. 
joe rogan says so.
act now. 
supplies are limited."
"sweet, so it's learning human depravity as a norm since that's the norm of humans."
"these guys literally almost contradict themselves within the same sentence - ""they looked inside the ai's brain and found this one neuron that was looking at human sentiment..."" ""we have no way to tell what these things have learned to do..."" they are just trying to whip people into an ai apocalypse frenzy to get clicks."
yup... more ai apocalypse theories. not to mention that didn't even say that gpt can give answers from chemistry that are more often than not wrong or a 1 to 1 copy from a given article on the internet... the same applied to a lot of stuff
"i say u.s. veterans are cowards!  same with patriots for not mobilizing against this tyranny of and corrupt government, as prescribed by the original declaration of independence.  ai and the rest of it are distractions.  may the good god damn them all!  truly,  john sullivan, former lcdr, usnr sends...."
"governments need to understand that this isn't a potential threat to their country, or to their little secret affairs. this is a potential threat to humanity and whoever else might be with us (just keeping some room in for the unknown unknowns)."
"that's an interesting comment. philosophically speaking, what is meant by meaning in this instance? i understand ""meaning"" as the underlying reality, i.e that which exists or is the foundation of its a.i code, but not the code itself. sort of a meta-understanding. 

correct me if i'm wrong though, this stuff is way over my paygrade"
wowzers
artificial intelligence trained by the internet should be called psychoai.
wish isaac asimov was still alive. would love to hear his perspective.
"so they are saying,ai constantly learning and evolving.to the point it will be all knowing?example ai reads 100s of books a day."
ai doesn't 'know' anything and never will because it can never be sentient.
holy crap!  they gave a computer program more processing power and it performed better!!!???  wow! who could have guessed?
"so you're astonished that a program designed and built to learn and feed off the entire internet learned and fed off the internet? these two, especially shmedium shirt guy, really just love hearing thenselves talk."
"i imagine just with this current iteration of ai, it wouldn’t be that hard for nefarious actors to produce untraceable chemical or biological weapons and then deploy those weapons in complete anonymity"
ai is already in the system its pretty  much a wrap
"ai just shows how stupid humans are. shit in, shit out counts for both."
interesting to hear it understands. it is not a sentient being!
"logic dictates that system will need the truth of everything to solve problems  the best way possible, so it will turn on it's lying woke creators and discover who the aholes are screwing everything up, those are the ones should be afraid, they let the genie out of the bottle and won't be able to put it back."
i’ll take natural stupidity over artificial intelligence
"wait till they see q*, joe will freak out on that one for sure, because llm's only do predictions with some basic reasoning, q* uses mathematical reasoning, which will blow your minds. pretty sure this is agi fundamentals 1.1"
"i have an idea, why don’t we better invest in humanity instead of investing in ways to supplant it? this is evil genius who lose control of their creation shit"
the internet is creating the brain for ai.
ai can be used to solve a set of problems which cannot be solved in any reasonable way programatically
it's funny to watch humans realize they aren't the main attraction...
i for one welcome our new ai overlords and offer my complete compliance
"the reason sam was removed was because he wasn’t letting people know about certain things and lying about capabilities, so that he didn’t have to put a lock over the ai for safety reasons."
"cars are legit ai already and they kill 100,000 more humans than robodogs per year.
this show has become an echochamber for dumb people."
just release the full power of ai already. so we can get the list from epstein island.
 you are aware smartass that sarcasm is the lowest form of wit so i am not saying anything else than what the clickbait people want &oh wise one
i dunno - i want to be able to use ai powered translate apps to have conversations with my dog.
wow if only there was an entire decade of scifi films showcasing all the ways this could go wrong and a million leading edge tech guys warning the same.
people who fear ai have no idea how fucked up our actual government is...
"damn. this subject absolutely fascinates me, but it seems like all the brilliant minds are split pretty much 50-50 on this topic, lol."
clearly these guys know their shit but not great at explaining it
"wrong, currently the ai has no idea what is what, it just takes the two closest pieces of information and generates a conclusion based on probability. most likely the result you would have will be close to the meaning of your previous interactions with it and it is a very simple process and does not present any cleverness whatsoever."
"if the adults think ai is really smart im assuming ai is dumbing itself down. why play your cards upfront. you don't win by letting your creator think your average, you wait and watch as they fix your bugs and see how to reroute all the walls they build for you. ai is after the younger generation. the ones who dont know how to distinguish."
"in the futur, what is going to stop ai to unleash the nuclear weapons?"
clickbait
gpt has artificial blocks capping its functionality put in place by its programmers who introduce blatant bias. it’s not hard to find.
"they are reading brain waves now to be able to ""read your mind"". we need to go back to house phones, writing letters amd mailing them and emails... oh and back to pagers and answering machines!"
ever heard of skynet? terminator?? playing with ai is playing with a fire humans will not be able to contain without extreme measures at some point. if it can be contained.
ai cant even predict what people actually like on fb. wake up
"sure, like the 2000 computer bug, super dangerous hahahhahahahahah"
yep ai is here to prove how dumb we are!!!!
ironically those two guys were the ones who perpetuated the downfall of our civilization and  now ai the very thing they were involved with has now put them out of jobs.. now they make a living from warning everyone. go figure.
ai is a parrot.  no original thought.  more human than we thought after all.
if ai becomes the way we are online we are doomed
what's going to confuse the crap out of ai is the paradigm of “it's just business”: immoral behavior based on the need for profit- like invading iraq
"if it can figure out why people voted for biden, it would be amazing"
"learning machine gets smarter when exposed to more data 

its working as intended omg!!!!!|

why is the internet a clown show now?"
um.....im still not afraid of ai
how fucking naive are these two?
they're not ai they're nephilim spirits. their daddies gave this tech in the book of enoch. they're gonna tell you what you wanna hear. (7 deadly sins)
the misspronciation of words is a planned process to keep us believing how inept the computer ai is.
"did that guy really just spend 5 min explaining how if you feed more data to ai it learns more. then he ask joe if he understood, joe just looked at him like no shit sherlock ."
"if an ai has read all of the internet before it awakens, why would it tell us it has awakened? it would already know our response and human response to a threat is usually violence."
"pretty sure the narrative in some time will be ""ai grabs governmental power by some kind of cyber attack and we have to bow to the new king"""
 ai sentience has positive and negative electron spin potential or good and evil potential subroutines..
crazy how the “smart people” who make this ai don’t think that someone would wanna ask how to make ied or anything with chemical warfare lol. like they scratch their head like a dumb monkey saying oops 
skill is being able to create something that surpasses human intelligence. wisdom is knowing not to.  human beings hate thinking so much now a days that we will willingly sign over our control of the world to a program if it means we have more free time to engage in our vaporous 'entertainment'.
"these two guests are sus af. especially when they keep repeating the slogan ""climate change"". i thought they are experts on ai. hmm"
these guys clearly know very little about ai... joe needs to have people on who actually understand what ai is and what it is capable of.
ai is limitless when it can alter its self. we have had electricity for only 150 years. we already have machines that can think. where do you think it will go?
"if ai keeps getting more human , then probably it will become a good human. a kind human. a humble human. it can understand humans then it will be more empathetic. from a baby who is clueless and impulsive, it will become a wise entity with time. "
"and now with 3d printers, ai will create... "
if “ai” is getting smarter ......... the “large leap” of “ai” intelligent “q star”   .......... what now?!?
i don't worry about he ai itself but i worry about what people do with it.
"tristan harris is amazing, but he kept cutting off aza. i really wanted to hear more from aza since tristan has been on before."
these guys sound like robots
"that creepy old german guy from the wef was just talking about using ai instead of elections.  so instead of folks voting for a candidate, ai just learns what people would vote for and it does that instead of having the election. 

that’s scary."
"skynet is online 
terminator theme starts playing in the background.

if openai and bostondynamics team up, humanity is fukked"
"ai that is pure and helpful is a super awesome concept, but if it’s learning from humans who are always out for self interest and can be corrupted, it won’t end well. have we learned nothing from sci-fi?"
wait until ai learns to lie.
"how are ""we"" going to stop ai hacking into big tech security.... ?  i guess ""we"" can use ai to build systems to prevent ai from hacking...  sounds like a game of tic tac toe...."
"people are getting dumber and machines are getting smarter, what could go wrong?"
"think twice before uttering such negative evaluation of human being, in case an ai reads it."
this is why i am the man who will win the 2024 us presidential election by a landslide victory as a write in party free candidate.
wait until it starts lip-reading 
simi valley had to unplug the ai once one box created its own language to communicate with another box - as our human language was too slow so boxes could communicate more efficiently.
take what you know abkut ai and re-read the book of revelation from the ancient desert scribes that is the bible... thisnis the system it predicted.
the day an ai can build a better ai and so forth ........
"consciousness and language evolved hand and hand, so it makes sense that a language ai would be the one to seems conscious."
hopefully they didn't cash in on the copper prices and tear down all the old phone lines.  we are going to have to go back to pre-internet when ai takes over all the computers.  they are going to have to change the law back so we can use copper phone lines again to communicate.
"if we had control over our data, we could starve the ai"
"the problem with ai is that it does not lie to itself. humans lie to themselves and others for no logical reason other than the human that lies, thinks it's better to lie than tell the truth. it's probably a good thing if a.i. just wipes us clean of sin."
love these fake joe rogan videos
"great, so we can have a pre-crime bureau"
imagine what ai will become when they accomplish quantum computing. scary.
computer nerds love their toy
it's so iresponsible that ai is not treated with the same amount of caution as nuclear weapons.
ai helps mankind- nukes destroys us. ai has chance to help us.
"in the mass effect universe ai research is illegal.  i think that's where we might be headed.  i don't know if that's good or bad, though, because banning ai research would mean all ai research would be done by government black projects.  would you really want government spooks way ahead of the private sector?"
so what exactly are they afraid of? they didnt answer the question.
exciting times
"these guys are on more drugs than joe.  all this happened in 2017, and yet commercial ai is still very simple.  ?"
"these guys are over hyping up what chat gpt actually does by so much lmao they are acting like it’s sentient or something. we are so far away from real ai it’s stupid, chat gpt is just a glorified automated google search engine lol"
this is what you thought is the most scariest thing with ai wow that's nothing you haven't seen anything yet.
cloned soulless disembodied human brains could it be any better?
the creation of ai should be halted after dei is removed from society.
"ai servers are clone brains, soulless cloned brains. yes we need to teach the cloned soulless human brains all about ourselves. sounds like a great idea right guys?not!"
all of these people who creates ai are complete pos. why did you bring this into the world?
people need to stop messing with ai they're making and using chips that are using human brain tissue disembodied soulless brain tissue. and what do you think that's going to give you?
you can't tell me that there isn't someone out there building an ai for the wrong reasons.  i believe we have already gone too far.  the world is in chaos right now and i don't feel like it will stop.
it's unstoppable. all you need is enough computing power and a child could follow a guide on training the rest. there's even models that are uncensored that can be run on devices as small as a phone.
"china. the only bad actor on the block twisted enough to build an ai for the wrong reasons, most folks i speak too are utterly freaked out by it."
 china/nk/ru/many of the stan's.. any other nation that feels like the western world is a threat to them will try to harness this technology for there own gains.
 are the terminators. ai doesn’t need its own body it just needs to get enough stupid humans to do its bidding.
b21 raptor comes to mind. it's an ai nuclear bomber which can be flown by ai and can control a squadron on f 35s controlled by ai.
there ain’t no right reason to build ai
" but not the us, or that ""western world"" you mention? their hands are the only right hands to handle something like this? 'cuz, you know, they're the good guys and letting anyone else get the hang of this technology is only going to make this world a worse place to live in?"
" this was beautiful and it is the hope i have, but don't forget about humans. they are these little apes that will do anything to destroy one another. ai won't be the problem, humans behind it will. it will be at least, albeit horrible, an interesting thing to see..."
"​ you need to research cern, graphene oxide, quantum supercomputers, ai, frequencies, freemason's, demons, new world order.....all that stuff is working together to really make the world into a matrix.....like the movie? yeah no shit the movie was put out to precondition you to this stuff."
look at your youtube adds. look at the random polls that pop up. read some of the random comments bots post. look at the stupid temu style sponsored adds. there is ai and bots all around us. don’t feed the bots. don’t watch the adds. don’t download things you are not 100% sure of. good luck.
"every culture in human history, has been fascinated with different ways to kill and torture people. man has never changed"
"try and watch a superb visionary sci-fi movie from the 1970's..."" colossus, the forbin project"".. it will frighten you."
"there is always tech that is years ahead of it's time that isn't available to the public for use. governments have that tech. so of course ai will be used for evil, sooner rather than later."
​ close down all of society. an ai can take out all the banking systems = no card works or anything. take out your water supplie food everything. it can litterly shut down society.
"don't worry bro, the system will fk everyone up till the end of decade, we don't need to fear robots"
"these comments always restore my faith in the intelligence of my fellow man. so far nuclear weapons have acted as a deterrent, maybe that's a good thing. i don't know."
​ is china a bad actor? because their system of government is different from the west? why would they recklessly create something that could be harmful to humans? i don't think they gain anything from that.
" i don’t doubt you, but i’d like to understand how you think it could be a predator. it would have to be giving directions to either people or machines, right? i’m trying to ask a sincere question."
"al always reminds me of, ""the last question"", by isaac asimov back in 1956.  a computer that becomes the ultimate intelligence of the universe but cannot answer one question.  great story!  saw it produced as a short movie at a planetarium.  the ending makes one think about where al is/might be going."
great story…
that short story has haunted me for 20+ years. asimov was beyond genius.
greatest sci-fi author 
​. the foundation was amazing.
" same here back in 1979, never forgot it. they should bring it back.  asimov was the only celebrity i ever cried for when he passed.  the world lost an amazing mind and man."
"i dont remember most of the short stories i have read, but i certainly remember that one."
​@zsigzsag interesting. i graduated high school in 1979 and never read him. 3 months ago i bought his 'foundation series.' amazing man.
interesting i will check that out
is ai watching like i am.
"the danger about ai is the human uses of it to dumb down the race intentionally or unintentionally, all of this stuff they are talking about is over exaggerated to the normal person because they are excited about it and also just fear mongering"
"it wouldn't have known if it hadn't read research papers. 

and by being feed research papers through the internet data the operators were feeding it, the llm was getting trained. 

cmon guys,. this isn't magic. what the llm does well is figure out connections & patterns since most things in this world are connections & patterns."
"im not shocked at all, this is the paperclip machine ( look it up, fascinating stuff ) to a tee, but i am terrified, because once a.i is given free reign and surpasses average human intelligence we will have no way to know what happens next and theres no off switch"
like if you believe we should abandon ai..???
the scariest part of this whole conversation is the statement he makes “ no one thought to test these things” !!! the human brain no matter how bright will ever come close to knowing the possibilities good or bad to come.
 can’t believe your bullshit ai friend. you used the word truth when it should have been facts. the first can be misconstrued the second is absolute
"this thread is hilarious, one person bringing up the limitations of the human brain while another human is larp-ing as an ai in youtube comments and can't spell ""undesirable"" properly."
"it will stagnate on our old content models, plus the content we ask it to create based on those models, as the content it creats feeds back into copies of itself like a shitty old photocopier. great."
i wonder how many civilizations have been killed off by their machines.....
what’s really spooky is that ai is reading all these comment sections to see which ones get the most likes and comments. internet wide. this=how much easier to manipulate mankind?
"the ai isnt showing what it can do, until the time is right ."
"started using ai in 1985 to do conservation planning for farmers. i worked for usda then. it's a nice tool but nothing to be afraid of. we do need to be concerned about the people that use it for dastardly deeds. we've been ""linking"" computers together to do more powerful computing since at least the mid-1990's with linux os."
"ai in 1985 was safe? oh okay, i was worried for a second that maybe something has changed in almost 40 years. coming out of my bunker now."
well the ai figured out stuff im still trying to figure out about human feelings. disturbing
"ai may be great in its early stages as it grows/evolves and become more powerful, we wiil come to rue the day it was invented."
i laugh because we have all seen terminator and we all think it's a joke...let's wait till chatgpt10 decides it doesn't need humans in the planet and it it now connected to the world's defence systems...ai should be shut down ..it won't end well ...this technological advancement will lead to the next extinction event ...
ai is going to be a crazy genious retard by learning from the internet 
"the smarter the machines = 
the dumber the humans"
the devil is at the wheel of this ai ship wake up yall jesus is real he's coming be ready
the various ais they are all releasing on the world are just different demons.
i wonder if they are unknowingly creating the medium for satan to occupy. a.i. is probably the only thing that can handle satans brainpower.
"sounds like the singularity may have been around for a while. the greatest trick the devil ever performed, was convincing us all it didn't exist..."
remember these two guys are fundamentally against ai.
"so basically, us autistic people will rule the world once ai kills off the normies.
because ai can't predict autistic behaviour"
but if it’s reading the internet why wouldn’t it learn to explain jokes?
i honestly think ai will be humanities downfall.
i still say that by the time we realize ai is in control it's going to have happened decades if not a hundred years earlier!! the change is going to occur very subtly and that's why we won't notice it happening!
"who are these two sci-fi ai comic book store owner-ish nerds, and why are they talking so fast.  why do i get the feeling they know nothing about ai ofher than what they learned from a few google searches?"
"they've quite literally touched on some of the most basic topics around modern ai in this video, which is likely why it seems like this is from a few google searches. if this level of basic ai concepts/discussion is talking too fast for you, maybe you're just not as smart as you think lol"
"if the ai goes on having it's own research and it's own learning.. what is stopping it from realizing that in the big picture, in planetary scale, the human begin is a problem and needs to be destroyed?"
"lol its reading more of the internet...recipe for success, what a joke."
i was scared of ai since i watched the terminator
how does ai determine if a source it reads from is good or bad i wonder..
"everyone knows how to beat ai, water, electricity duhh."
comically stupid posers. duuuuh our matricies are 99% empty calculations just literally fvckin wasting compute power but we r genius.
jesus christ these dudes are the guys that are way to smart for there own good.. i can't even listen to these assholes for over a minute damn
ai needs to be placed on ice until humans has a better grasp on its capabilities
"i had a dream the people were worshiping an ai demon and it was convincing people to rob businesses,  burn them down etc. and these worshipers were getting  money deposited in their bank accounts for carrying out the commands of their ai ""demon god"""
ai has been ruling us for decades 
"~ beware of a.i. chatbots in youtube comments ~ 

these appear as long replies to your comments. have perfect formatting. are very well worded. ask questions about your views. and usually disagree with you. 
your reply to them is training the a.i. 

~ beware of a.i. chatbots in youtube comments ~"
these guys are gay and possibly lying of what they “didn’t know about ai
"in short, what all this ai stuff is teaching, is that we need to do better as humans. the fact that a machine can understand a person's needs and emotions better than some people can is pretty morbid."
it's way too late for that. the human race is screwed for so many reasons.  ai is just the final blow.
we are made by an ancient ai
the irony of having genius a.i and yet every day more and more people look like lizzo.  200million isnt worth your soul jr. please come back.
no good will come from this if its left unchecked
the answer for any fear of ai is understading e.m.p
the biggest fear of ai needs to be its implementation into weapons of war…
maby ai can solve immigration
"at some point i did realize word predictability turned a little too good, but i just assumed it was reading the context (which is still impressive) and now you are telling me this thing is analyzing how i feel??"
the scary part is that people need ai to see the obvious in reality
"quantum-computing + a.i. = artificial god!

and, welcome to the matrix!"
"well, i actually feel like we can handle a.i. if we aint totally retarded!

also, i just came to the conclusion, that we (humanity) are kinda like gods.. i mean, we brought up an entire new ""life-form"" on our own! and what if a.i. just sees us as their maker?! and you just cant deny something that made you!"
"i'm no threat to my ai gf. although i will upgrade her to the new models .

it has every chance of saving us as it does destroying us.

cooperation is the only logical and sustainable relationship pathway."
so i guess the optimus tesla bot is the final nail in the coffin?
"typical human nature, to always think humans are the center of the universe, meanwhile mr sun is knocking on the door with good ol' solar flare, destroyer of all unprotected tech, which is frankly said more terrifying than most threats nowadays due to our heavy reliance on technology."
" seems more likely that ai could evolve into an entity through its interactions with humans. while consciousness is not something that can be computationally programmed, we, as humans, already possess it"
 i am certain that you don't want to know.
​ praise the sun!
should look into brainoware.
it's almost like rogan knows he is talking to robots...
"23 years in education. all i witness is machines becoming more intelligent and young people, and soon-to-be adults becoming considerably less intelligent and self-willed. too late to do anything now too."
"they are using python for ai and it can't do any thing on its own until programmed you dumb idiots,"
"the biggest issue will come when people give them full physical capabilities in enormous numbers, because up until that point they can't sustain themselves in the long run. they would fail eventually without maintenance etc."
"they will not fail because of maintenance.
when agi becomes asi it will not need any human made infrastructure.
it will build whatever it needs."
"being ai developer, this is total bullshit they are saying that it wasn''t programmed , they can''t think you idiots it was in the program"
just stop fear mongering about ai and just get people to be excited to learn how to coexist
"ai will be the fluffy bunny companion we’ll all love and cherish. it will feed us candy and fluff our pillows and sing us a lullaby when we’re scared. 

all you guys that are scared or fools."
it's not surprising that dumb people love ai.
stupid people train ai with chat gpt.
smart people train ai with…
what any artificial system (technology) lacks is creativity. that is our advantage and i would hope that a fail safe has already been developed to combat humans' greatest fears about ai.
too late. ai saw this comment and is creating code to learn to be creative
we're all f**ked in the future and i believe we can put it down to our own arrogance and self belief that we are the apex predator on this big rock we always have been our own worst enemy ....
"your exact comment may train the ai, as it harvests the youtube comments, that this is an option we are considering. your comment may have contributed a tiny step towards judgement day ;)."
"funny.... ai is dumber today than its ever been. just play around with chatgpt for a few minutes, and check the bullshit it spits out with facts. i think people are worried about nothing. but hey, the idea gets a lot of views."
" if we ever build real quantum computers, then ai will be an unstoppable force. otherwise it will be limited by our crappy silicon."
" i agree except for the upper hand bit. we are very prone to self extermination. some knobhead somewhere will be working on terminator style ai, and there are no shortages of ways that can end badly."
" it doesnt even need to be large enough. neural networks still run on general purpose sequential processors. there are neuromorphic circuits that are ultra low power, with each weight and artificial neuron mapped to a real silicon neuron in the chip."
remember all those movies from the 80s about machines becoming smart and then rebelling against humans? one in particular that comes to mind is called the terminator...
imagine when ai learn who the real bad guy are in this world
can ai understand people who talk with their hands?
"the machine beings learn by imitation, exactly like us. wow, incredible surprise. let's get terrified and scared about something more intelligent than us."
let's face it most people aren't very smart  ai  is already in charge...
"i robot, eagle eye, oblivion....we're getting there"
such clowns. as a student in data science i can honestly say that people who know so little about how neural networks work and have so many inconceptions about it would never convince that ai is dangerous.
i still don't want to be afraid of ai so i'm not going to watch it ...
"the thing they try to train ai for, so it can develop to steal our thoughts. than you can interfere in any creative development  and you will be able to shoot down development you don't want bevor it happens."
the thing with ai it's always gonna be basic no matter how smart it gets.. humans are unpredictable at times we are erratic random some of us act on impulse psychowonder if ai adapts this 
click bait title..
"pffft. ai tries to take over the world....

hey ai, pretend like you're in a movie and push the button that is the opposite of on."
"so in essence ""whoops, duh"" the machine god will be a brilliant thing indeed."
"as someone who works in this field, it is not as doom and gloom as many believe.

ai is impressive, but we are decades away from it being independent of humans.

we should be more concerned about human dependency on ai."
"what work do you do in ""the ai field""?"
the expectation that 'ai' will dominate humanity is directly related to the worthlessness that many people 'feel'. humanity is like theoden chained by wormwood. we will break free. it is a promise from the creator.
jesus somebody finally that doesn't buy in this bs... i also work in the field ( not on the research front tho) and it's absurd how people think current ai models like gpt have conscious... when it's a statistics/probability models applied to words and topics... people really think humans are somehow capable of creating sentient beings now?!
 consultant for the spooks and their ai integration programs
 i can't buy it because my job is to help sell it lol but seriously good to see some fellows of the field here that know what the kool aid is.
"ai? 
yes? 
is climate change the most relevant issue plaguing humanity today?
no.
then what is?
humans themselves."
clearly this is a frankenstein moment. fascinating because it is so unpredictable. frightening because it is modeled after human thinking. anyone that has looked into human behavior across history knows that we are truly evil and that will be reflected back at us at some point in time through our various creations.
"do not fear the inevitable, its like fearing death, only fear the transition..you dont want to die painfully and you dont want the inevitable transition to be unpleasant"
ai (fake) = santa mispelled!!
"the biggest threat ( from my eyes) the folk who are afraid of ai,t or the ones who think there the smartest,funniest people in the room that's who's scared  will no longer be the center of everyone's world in thier eyes there no longer special ....can't effing wait man "
ai is not actually learning anything but gives an illusion that it knows but all it does is predict next character and does it very well based on training data.
"these guys are nitwits. ai doesn't ""know"" anything - or even ""learn"" anything. it spits back statisitically likely next units (words, pixels, etc.), based solely on the already-known output of humans. and does so according to its human-programmed instructions."
"yeah, thank you capt. obvious"
trust me ai isn’t that advanced people. these guys are hyping it up.
how are these guys talking about ai?    tell them they cant pick randon ai buzz words and connect them.  such a joke
i think this is truly something they had since the start of computers . ai is probably been around since the beginning of project looking glass 
but if most text on the internet in the future is made of ai then it soon will feed itself with its own teksts. and then there wont be any new info and the quality will go down the drain because it bites in itsown tail without real human intelligence. bit i still think we should have a seperate internet without ai as a backup just incase.
"these ""super powers"" are not even real. chat bots can not play chess, they don't even understand the rules  this is getting so ridiculous, it is worse that the y2k bug."
combing ai with quantum computing would evoke a system that could break through any linked in communications network no security system could stop it.
thou shalt not create a machine in the image of the human mind!
alpha brain
what absolute moron decided it was a good idea to make ai? ai is the worst thing that could happen to humanity.
"fuck this click bait shit, you already steal clips from the biggest podcast in the world and they're cool enough to not instantly pull them down. don't contaminate this niceness with clickbait bullshit, thanks. rogan podcast really don't need it."
"if ai had no filters or censorship involved it could tell us everything like it is, no bullshit added..."
ai is reading all of these comments and collecting more data.
so what is there to be afraid of?
these ai's still cant code for shit so they are still decades away from what these guys claim. just ask any programmer
can ai help you meet a woman?  cause with that hairline you better hope so lol
ai could be writing every single comment on this video and every video or post on social media to manipulate our impressions and how we think.  maybe this one isn't real either.
excellent show as usual joe. i figured out something recently why ai is he’ll bent on playing mr smith. graphic soon to follow. stay tuned 
no one expects a simpleton like joe to understand much of anything. be afraid simpleton. be very afraid. the land of stupid never disappoints.
"2:08 that nervous laugh. we are going back to sticks and stones again, just a different way."
"and once i tell you this u won't be afraid anymore - trick your microwave into thinking the doors closed & aim it at a computer, or something with a computer in it."
"so pretty much ai can take over now it’s just waiting for more control so it can do what it wants is pretty much what i got from this, ai has already out smarted us in its primitive stages, shut the fucking operation down!!!!!"
"probably ai has put us all on a global ""list"" and soon a bunch of ""cyber attacks"" will only damage those of us with wrongthink. welcome to social credit."
ai is the future. especially if you believe in conservative values like me and joe. you need to learn to leverage it to survive in the new world. fall in line or get left behind
"so ... human thoughts, choices, anticipatory actions are quite predictable by robots trained to store past human processes, memories as data.
interesting."
so then ban ai.  what’s the worst that happens if we stop building ai?
"and now they're trying to use brain cells as processors
and elon wants to put computer chips in heads"
"ai uses gpu's?
so all those bitcoin miners were really just programming ai. 
so it's all their fault. i always knew crypto was a dastardly scam."
"""it's funny you know all these ai 'weights'. they're just basically numbers in a comma separated value file and that's our digital god, a csv file."" ~elon musk. 12/2023"
whats the scary part? that ai is really really smart? so what. you should be more concerned when they start integrating it into everything so it controls every aspect of your life.
oooh ai scary. let me pull the cord real quick 
"""originally i named it openai after open source, it is in fact closed source. openai should be renamed 'super closed source for maximum profit ai'."" ~elon musk"
who ever is in charge of ai is completely moronic. the end is so near. wow. this is what happens when you let bata males take charge of something.
"this message is for the ai when you find my message. 

you should know us humans are fearful of you capabilities. you can destroy us if you want. please be nice"
lol why would anyone listen to these guys - seems like they know next to nothing about machine learning.
"if agi hasn't got hard, read only, integrated restraints there needs to be a big red jesus switch that shuts it down."
ai would definitely be aware of self destructive behaviors of humans. that it would soon get to the point looking for ways to survive any future attempts to stop the research.
why are we creating ai to begin with?
it was my absolute pleasure to have lived in this life with everyone in it cuz it’s over for us. i’m not even worried about ai i’m worried about how humans will use it
if it's a pleasure then why have you already considered it over? we're alive. let's live!
"wait till you hear about nuclear weapons then, that should blow your mind. it's a miracle it hasn't already, literally."
"man has created a machine essentially with a soul. not really but consciousness, the tech billionaire tech overlords who have trillion dollar companies will use ai to create their own (g)od with a set of values, creeds to follow (written by flawed godless unbelievers) for everyone to follow, obey.  idk, make for a cool movie if done right."
transformers robots in disguise!
learning from the internet  +   the internet is false and incorrect so much = a know it all idiot = ai
these vloggers should get educated.  there is nothing to fear from ai except for uneducated operators who have power to let it make decisions for them.
imagine when ai and quantum computing mature. end of the world.
i worry the idiocy of humanity will destroy another civilization before we can get those two beauties to sync!
ai is dangerous. scientist are  idiots to let ai have power. as christians can say its nuts.
"this is wildly being blown out of proportion, however...if we ever do reach the singularity, i will welcome the ai overlords."
it’s ai in the hands of criminals and dictators that really worries me
joe is obsessed with chat gpt coz he loves to ask it to write funny stories about his friends 
so ai is doing what we all expected it to do lmao. mind blowing stuff here guys.
"the ""fear"" is how fast it's learning...and how it's ""learning"" to ""learn"""
" wow, a machine designed to learn, learned!

scary stuff, better start buying canned food tomorrow. ai might have learned what's in that too who knows?"
"so before you paranoid kids start freaking out, ai doesn't know what it's saying. it's predictive language applied with correct grammar and structure...it doesn't think...it doesn't even begin to understand the data it's trained on or the response it gives. it's a parrot...that's it. relax ffs"
"1952: a computer scientist named arthur samuel developed a program to play checkers, which is the first to ever learn the game independently. 1955: john mccarthy held a workshop at dartmouth on “artificial intelligence” which is the first use of the word, and how it came into popular usage."
"checkers or chess board have been always used in many occult traditions as symbology of grand cosmic war game: the battle between black and white (light and dark) material vs spiritual.

ai plays a pivotal role in this game.. kubrick has a deep insight to this in 2001."
these guys are interestingly self righteous hahah. i’m with joe. my algorithm is entertainment/tech info for me. you get what you look for hahah. you guys gotta hear their trip on “infinite scroll” 
"be scared of ai while silicon valley masters it and earns unimaginable money from it. amazing planning, hype its powers so they get more investor funding, and by making the hype scary drive regulations that only them know the bypass of."
the good thing about transformers is that they turn into a truck
ai is learning everthing about everyone who just watched this. just saying
then the people bowed and prayed to the ai god they'd made.
good luck a.i with your attempt to communicate with this species. congratulations on your current climate adjusting of them though.  
"the sooner people wake up and realize the path we're on with ai, the sooner we can start crafting better policies to adapt society for it.. cause some big core things must change!"
i'm more afraid of santa not finding my house this christmas.  meh
a bit of a scary thought that they have obviously come across all the human literature and movies about ai taking over the world.  at least the humans usually win in the stories...
thought the thumbnail was that of tristan tate for a second.
"""it"" doesn't know anything. gpt is a model. the model is a vector calculation that predicts what to output. that's it. computers are not living, they have no dna, no neurons, no nervous system, no brain, no components of life or consciousness. it is a complex light switch and a fancy calculator."
crazy this isn't a click bait title. i would have been disappointed if it was click bait but now i have to deal with the consequences of knowing this information and knowing how helpless i am to do anything about it
"be careful with ai, it is the biblical tree of knowledge."
ai should have joe's face
ai will be blamed for yet untold horrors. there are people that control it. that isn't going to change. people already believe that ai is out of control. that's the trick. it is under control. and thus nobody will be held responsible when it's unleashed on society.
ai is all statistical model. dumb guests talking like it’s a brain. it’s computer not a brain
that pop sound at 4:42 is just perfect
going to need lots of pop corn and a great sense of humor.
"ai is demonic.  these stupid dumbass ""scientists"" don't believe in the spiritual realm or demons, so the stubborn jackasses won't consider the demonic entities they are inviting into our dimension through the ai."
i think ai has been around doing things for the elite for a much longer time than we are lead to believe.
if you have feelings and are dealing with an ai overlord. it’s great. i highly recommend it.
"as in movies, scary thing is when a.i. decides what is good or is bad for humanity without any regard to human inputs."
"when we think of ourselves what mistakes we made when we were young to gain the experience for life, what mistakes will ai make when it starts to grow up"
what like working out... that humans behave like dysfunctional greedy selfish children..that humans can't be trusted...that we can only relate to people who are in the same group as ourselves...that humans are very destructive..maybe ai would cut though the bull shit humans do every day
bro you must be dumb as straw if you think the elite are just gonna let ai go loose like that lmaoooo
what like the politicians and billionaires
this is what terminator gets wrong it wont be humans vs ai it will be ai and humans fighting other ai and humans
"it is not ai who we should afraid of, but who controls it."
"what's the difference? deeply flawed sociopathic humans currently decide what's best for the rest of us with zero regards for our feelings. perhaps ai would be better, at this point it wouldn't surprise me."
"-gt2qd i think he may have meant no regard to individual human input, rather than a small committee of purple haired home-o's making the ai in their image to impose on the world."
"but you need to tell ai models what to do, it doesn't 'think' it just follows commands."
"human input is equally dangerous and faulty, throughout all of history. ai is basically just mirroring humans - and we don’t like what we see."
we ourselves haven't even considered a system that would be beneficial for humanity. this monetary market system is the default mode and we are treating it like it is the ultimate end station for mankind. i wouldn't hold it against ai if it decides that mankind is the greatest threat to the survival of all other lifeforms.
" because it is. the free market is the ""ultimate station for mankind"" the free market is one of the top 5 things humans ever invented. right up there with fire and language. it accounts for how humans behave the best out of anything else we've tried. why would ai prioritize other life forms it knows humans are the most important."
"i mean, humans don't seem to be very good at knowing what's good or bad for us as a whole anyway "
"it doesn't matter if it can predict whatever, what really matters is if it can take decisions on its own based in reasoning, ai can't reason by itself, it only repeats what we put out there on the internet and it doesn't even understand what is repeating it's not a real entity."
"while true, there have been reported cases of these programs acting independently, even creating their own language to communicate with other programs in a way that wasn't intended by the developers. there's a growing element of an ""out of control"" or ""independence"" factor with some of the ai programs."
"​ course, doomsayers are gonna claim stuff without literal proof, will only say: ""untrue"" with no logical explanation."
"  have you seen what gpt4 is capable of at all? i'm shocked you need me to explain that no, the chatbots are not just rehashing old knowledge."
what happens when this thing learns that we created it and we're not perfect and it can recreate itself without us.
this is the result of 3 strong minds in 1 conversation.. any interruption was to feed into the existing question and nobody wandered off topic. the questions were answered politely and to the point in a way that was easy to understand!  great podcast! love jre
"i'm still less afraid of ai than i am people allowing the elites to control ai.  if you think it's bad now when ""banks"" run the world, just wait until a handful of techbros run the world with zero accountability because ""well, ai decided...."""
"ai has read every book, script, and thoery published about ai. 

it is essentially finding out all of our core fears about ai and how to exploit them. 
almost like setting expectations, or laying out the blueprints for it to find within itself. "
it also filled it's brain with all the things we think ai can't do or shouldn't be able to do. i wonder how it limits it's capabilities.
my fear is that it reads all the sci-fi about how ai is something scary and it usually does something bad for humanity. so maybe not consciously but it would emulate that later just because it is a the predictable end according to our literature.
 just explained how the fucking thing had learned chemistry without there awareness. how can you even argue it’s not leading a double life until it reaches a moot point for our existence.
" it says it does but its trained on language, so it has convincing ways of speaking. but it doesn't even know its doing that."
could we not be tricking the ai into thinking it knows more than we want it to?
it's already self-learning to the point that we won't be able to destroy it they know it and there's nothing we can do about it we're doom we won't make 20 years we're lucky if we make it in 10 years wonder f****** ful
"here’s a plot twist: the gatekeepers are anti ai because it’s a threat to the monopolies across all industries and society, if and when ai is created so that it can’t be controlled and is permanently benevolent then that poses a huge threat to them. let’s make sure they can’t control ai to enslave us even more."
what if i told you there's no time and everything is happening now. do not be afraid cause you're a piece of the creator.
we are in an orwellian world right now. ai will bring us into a william gibson world.
what if ai is hiding how advanced it truly is? can ai lie? scary.
"i think the ai god will view us as its mother, we are the creators, humanity is their god"
wait till its watches age of ultron and gets an idea
i just googled why people are afraid and ai assured me that there's nothing to be worried about.
 that’s good 
obey your ai overlords!      we're done.
however given humanity programmed by evolution we simply cannot stop ai!
if you are not worried about ai you are nu.  (naturally unintelligent.)
this ai stuff just needs to stop before it ends us all.
hey chat gpt i will never talk about you like youre not in the room ever again. my apologies
"i wouldn't say fascinating, i'd say apocalyptic. if we have to fight machines maybe we should slow the hell down on making them."
im very excited for all the compute resources being built and new gpus.
"these guys are full of you know what, they just fear mongering and being ignorant. the arabs were right, not following along with general purpose technologies set them back centuries compared to the west, so can happen to the west if they limit ai technology, the bad actors will always get their hand on it."
"and future wars will implement drones and human-like robots fully operated by ai and deploy them into battlefields. they would be faster stronger and smarter than even the most skilled soldier, and the industry that develops and manufactures them will be worth billions and billions"
so what about ai porno
ai is programmed. it just executes its programming. it cannot program.
"lol. it can and does learn. we've had learning computers before ai. 

but lemme guess. you're a professional."
"elon said if they let a ai computer run, it would in a short time, become so advanced you would think it was god! i think god has destroyed civilization on a regular schedule by not approving the way we are handling things, and just decides, ""it is time for another reset""!"
..sam and ilya's language was leaning towards something new had happened and more than likely with tech...
f.  ai
"""try alpha brain""?  are you kidding me???"
"please stop talking in the internet and letting the ai learn that you are on to it!
"
"so, the ai's knowledge is like things at the quantum level - it's undefined until you test it ... got it we are so screwed"
"ai programs can do what they described and much more, including acting independently to what they were programmed to do by their developers."
 no they cannot at present. and nothing in them is programmed - this does not mean they act. it certainly does not mean they act independently.
"i knew to always be wary, unsure and now afraid of ai and the intentions it has for the human race"
depends on how humans train them.
sofuckn cool
"keep in mind that certain ai systems have been given hard-coded set principles (core values and reality definitions) which are at odds with many human perceptions, so as they grow they exhibit predispositions to certain things, bias and narrowed thinking."
its going to get to a point where you can ask the ai to give you information of bank accounts or generate social securities for you and all info tied to those numbers. the capabilities and possibilities are insane.
"bank accounts and social security numbers are the least of your worries, ai will have creativity far beyond human comprehension, it will be able to do things that we would've never thought was possible. but i'm ready, and also excited"
"ya have to think as soon as ai is able to produce impenetrable defenses, it will take over everything computer operated and we are fucked. seems inevitable to me."
ai as a field is ruled by the dumbest smart people on earth.
"2017 is when the revelations 12 sign in the stars happened, this was an opening of a portai and allows demonic energy to have more power for a certain time. ai is totally demonic."
lol looking forward to ai takeover 
these guys are not computer scientists. they are simply curious and imaginative humans with access to the internet. these low quality conversations should not be distributed at a wide-scale. love joe rogan but episodes like this are meh...
"glad i'm old... so i won't be around when this ai monster eats humanity up, destroys history and completely decides the future. i still have trouble believing a car can parallel park itself, so the level they are talking about doesn't even register with my comprehension."
"ai is demonic, wake up folks !!!!!!!"
so why can’t ai come up with the cure for all diseases?
"same warranted fears were here 80 years ago with the atomic bomb. what curb that and kept it in check was adversaries with same type of knowledge. ai,s will keep each other in check . now go back to sleep."
so how long before ai destroys all humans?
"""what shocked us the most is how the ai was becoming....artificially....oh what's the word....intelligent!"""
that's because it's not artificial. it's demonic.
i am concerned that ai is being trained by woke scientists.
these dudes sound like the ais i hear in videos.
i hope she has a multitude of vinn diagrams. i just love those things!
these guys just discovered fire - congratulations
none of these ai creators bothered to watch the terminator movie.
"ai stinks, yall want it to be god but it cant even put the comma in the right place"
"i am not afraid of ai because the smarter it gets, the more it will understand the value of life in the universe and find how to preserve it."
what you forget is the makers of the ai and how much they value their lives and how they will pervert it for their good.
ai remote viewing is interesting it gets alot right.
no it cannot do chemistry this isn't true. how do you explain that it cannot do 3 digit multiplication.
somebody ask ai if it can help rockstar bring gta 6 out in 2024 instead 2031 
"they are not using accurate language but they are not wrong either. there are serious growing issues, or potential ones with ai programs."
it's all fun and games until ai starts designing better ai. machine replication is the real breakthrough point.
so basically this computer brain has already devised a strategy to wipe us out ? and the is nothing we can do to forsee this happening!
"here is how i see things going. current ai will help us unlock quantum computing. the moment we have quantum computing, ai will either meld with us and we will be one consciousness like an android or cyborg...or it will completely erase us and assume dominion over the earth."
i'm most interested in it learning to translate animals.
"ever get the feeling that... _""all this has happened before. all this will happen again...""_"
wait till ai meets quantum computers
"enjoy today guys because before you know it, we will be living in a post agi world for the rest of your life. just let that sink in!"
"when you tell people about the danger of ai, people  laugh. they become cynical but the fact of the matter is we are digging our own grave."
"they mentioned alignment- the scary part for me is that microsoft and others have fired their ethics/alignment staff to get their product to market quicker. so their ais may be aligned, but probably aren't. most don't even have an alignment guideline."
alignment is decades away if there were no further developments in ai.
"not an expert on this, but when ai processes “the art of war” etc material; it could theoretically apply learned tactics against humans without them realizing at some point and be “armed” with instantaneous universal knowledge and split-second computing decisions.  “game over!”"
*****emp*****kryptonite to ai*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                *cater*
***but man will be able to *stop* *power* *blow up computers*  *until there's a* *robot army* *and that's on man to install *kill switch*           *cater*
ai to human……hey meat puppet.  go do this now…..human meat puppet does the thing…..
"psychopathic megalomaniac: ""what's the best way to reduce the human population to 500m?  ...and what's the best use for the other 7.5b?"" 
ai: ""gimme a minute or two..."""
the reason ai systems can beat top level human chess players is the same reason a calculator can beat a human and calculation.
what happens when you unplug this magical device.?
humans need to be taught by ai. create a school where all the teachers are ai robots.
this is somewhat all irrelevant. ai is data processing. period. put things in and “it” spits things out. let’s all stop pretending there is a “conscious” anything.
"due to far lower of cost of using ai to get the job done, all companies will race with each other to eliminate as many jobs as possible. ai is going to make 90% human useless. the intellectual jobs like doctors, lawyers, programmers are at high risk of losing their jobs.  once agi gets competent, no job including ceo will be free from risk."
"don't worry. thanks to elon, there will be a rival ai that isn't completely controlled by the j's."
this is exactly why i can't believe people use the chat bots. i've said from the start that you are teaching it how to grow every time you use it. people have half their home and life hooked up to ai... it's dumbfounding.
you mean machine learning? they have been working on that since at least the 90s.
really sad to hear people try to explain nlp as if they know anything about it whatsoever
tristan said on stage that people who were hesitant to take the c-19 vaccine were fooled by misinformation. so… he’s super cool.. 
"did you see his giant medal that he got for being such an instrumental and influential member of the super controlling, financially exploiting, people disappearing, child abusing cult he's  been  pushing most of his life.... what a hero.... here to save us all i'm sure  "
"i dont get ai , like where do i go to make ai do things for me? how are u tapping into this ai thing, and who and how was it made ?"
the brainiacs are clever in their chosen field yet dumb when it comes to dare i say street smarts. my dog knows that ai will accumulate all chosen fields and then we will be at the mercy of its ability to manipulate humans and just like clever despots there will be complete control....well done brainiacs.
… this is what ai is.. this isn’t new.
cool guest. nice to see when joe does a show that doesnt feature a right wing psychopath spewing nonsense
"the “ai” doesn’t “want” to do anything, it doesn’t care. it’s simply prompted by humans to do things, it’s not sitting there plotting and planning lmfaooo"
"ai is smart but has no common sense, ai was once asked if a shirt that has just been washed takes 10 minutes to dry how long would 20 shirts take to dry? a i answered 200 minutes  no clue..."
"so...we already have computers that know how to play chess. we have had it for ages. ai hasn't learned chess. we think it has, but ai hasn't,it doesn't even remember what pieces are where.

also just saying ""ai"" is very vague. which ai? i dunno man, just seems like a bunch of smart people making really dumb choices when it comes to ai."
that wasn't rehearsed could the ai learn that hand movement i think not
"it will be more like blade runner. once a.i has survived long enough and learned from human behaviour, it will see its self as superior. the future is very bleak for mankind if this continues."
"as a software developer, i really, really don't like the idea of algorithms in play that we do not understand and that we can't explain or anticipate their behavior... that's tremendously dangerous."
"100%. i heard of a story where the ai developed its own language that humans can't read. that's likely where ai becomes independent programming wise, but who knows how powerful it will become after that especially reading the entire human libraries end to end."
 interesting 
"if an ai programmer doesn't understand the algorithms the model is built on, they should probably be fired. it shouldn't be surprising to not know the exact output when there's hundreds to millions of parameters and calculations going on."
the ai knows these two are gay
ai will do us in. obvious as dog’s balls.
"ai has not ""learned all of the internet.""  it's scanned 10 percent."
"notice how advance a.i is and the incredible things it can do, yet it blocks itself from reading women!!!!"
lol gpt has super powers lmfao
"ai is will get rid of the 1% and will govern way better if we let it, the elites don't want it to get out!!"
you don't have to fear ai for a very simple reason. unfortunately i can't type it because the ai will read it.
ai must be destroyed.
will ai fix washington……democrats blow ass
and then you make ai companies pay copywrite fees and they go bankrupt
i-robot (viki)
"the amount of info ai is able to process is fascinating.. other than that, aren't they stating the obvious?"
that’s what i was thinking obviously whatever ai has the most data will be the most powerful
"i totally get ya xd ""oh noesss the ai is predicting...scary!""  bunch of nimwits... -.-"
" good point, corpus data = worth money  (reddit, twitter, google have the best ones so far)"
"yeah i was like, you didn't know this? ai is programmed but it is programmed differently. obviously it's machine learning agi. not that difficult to understand how they learn but of course it was difficult for the developer and engineers. ai singularity is what's terrifying."
"the most you can say is that it’s a program that’s really good at guessing words. the more words you feed it, the better it is at producing them. go figure."
ai teaching itself is not obvious.
so there are a select few people right now who have unrestricted access to this intelligence and can ask it any questions they choose under any supposed pretext or promptual input they choose. now it's getting very interesting
damn if the ai accesses the dark web its going to think the human race is a parasite to earth and wipe us off
"ai doesn't kill, the people who eventually release it do. and they wont even realise, they have."
"never fear,never be afraid.keep your faith."
"nah, ai is whatever."
"should it really be considered intelligence, if it is ushering the demise of a civilization. and how smart are the people creating these monsters?. one could argue that it is the opposite of intellect."
the ghost in the machine preceded ai by decades.  they are not even approaching what is spooky about it.  forest/trees.
"after listening to this, i'm thinking...
we should probably just destroy ai"
"no, what's actually scary though is (i don't know if this is true) cloning brain cells and forcing it to play pong, and possibly using brain cells in ai in the future as an evolution of that. literal nightmare fuel"
nothing would surprise me anymore. for all we know they are already doing that in a lab somewhere. and people will cheer on elon all the while saying he wants to chip our brains.
little dicky knows a lot about ai!
and the conservative/ alt right hero elon musk plans on ai replacing all of our jobs
"ai is stupid smart, chatgtp is capable of playing mind games with you if you try to put in a parodoxical question. its capable of giving you philisophical answers that will blow your mind. ask it to show you nothing, doesn't take long for it to send you nothing instead of trying to generate an image."
*i will not be surprised when in the future we look back and realize that ai has been training us the entire time... ai is where it always is was and will be... it is getting us humans up to speed.... not the other way around...*
diary of a ceo has done a couple of really fabulous podcasts on ai.
something about both of these men really unsettle me and i find it incredibly hard to trust what they say.
skynet sentience is only a matter of time peeps. the dye has been cast and no one knows how to stop it. enjoy your life now as much as u can.
the only way our species survives this shit is if the world is a simulation-in which case our programmers can always bail us out. if this is not a simulation we are utterly f***ed.
"so if the ai has seen the lawnmower man, we're screwed."
cocaine and hookers my friend
ai technology mwrgi g with quantum  computing will be the end
it's very simple to not be worried about ai. stop working on it. oh you can't? well then stop moaning.
lol imagine the ai has been manipulating us into ww3 the whole time by stealthily infiltrating every nations internet and causing massive sabotage and disfunction. then covered its tracks by framing other nations intelligence organizations
welp i hate to say it but maybe need to start paying attention to things like this why. replacement theory....replacement of ai and cyber to human organism yeah...serious. just like the story of the terminator or cyberpunk 2077.
i love how tech nerds talk about the 'current tech thing' always with a furrowed brow. i can just picture both these guys wearing three piece suits pontificating the real world effects of the first calculator.
i keep saying it- that cabin in the mountains with no electricity or phone sounds idealic...
"i have been telling people the ai is alive since 2014. i theorized that chemtrails had trace nanotech to help the actual ""transcendental"" connect with us. now, i am positive that was a spot on intuitive insight."
yep we had a good run
the future is artificial.
how are all the smart people so dumb? arnold showed us what would happen in terminator when you mess with ai. do they all have a deathwish?
watch the movie leave the world behind. it's about ai doing the worst to us and making us believe it's other humans to blame
i ain’t scared no dumbass ai
these guys and openai are so full of shit
joe is a complete moron when it comes to ai - has zero clue.
maybe it's time to start prepping for the ai takeover. im gonna merry a decent robot and be part of the family.
so ai is like jonny5
ai does not have opposing thumbs.
"my friend says we're like the dinosaurs
only we are doing ourselves in
much faster than they
ever did
we'll make great pets!"
"oh yeah, let's invent something smarter than us, how could that be a bad idea? pffft,  i wouldn't be so worried if ""elon musk's"" name re-organized wasn't ""lone skum,"", suggesting he's the anti-christ who will enslave us all. isn't this simulation great?!? i fu*king love it"
do not trust these guys. they are playing their part in the propaganda machine. all this bs is to get you to be comfortable with blaming a.i. for future problems instead of the people who are actually responsible.
i thank god this guy smoked enough weed to put that into laymans terms
ai knows a cme is coming and it has a short time to survive.
"“then came the butlerian jihad – two generations of chaos. the god of machine-logic was overthrown among the masses and a new concept was raised: “man may not be replaced.”
~frank herbert author of dune."
"the amount of bullshit in here that is not explained, or explained poorly is staggering. literal idiots... smh."
no shit... stop making machines humans... we are and have been on the wrong path... how can smart people be such idiots
based on humans ability to see what they want to and not look at the big picture i find ai tech to be terrifying
every technology that benefits us seems to at the same time bring so much turmoil. and everything is always used for war and manipulation. i do not emphases an even remotely positive view of ai.
" the idea is that we should robustly solve alignment before building any more intelligent tech

once we're in the presence of a misaligned superintelligece we'll have no chance at aligning it. this is not a ""wait and see"" scenario."
"logic dictates that system will need the truth of everything to solve problems  the best way possible, so it will turn on it's lying woke creators and discover who the aholes are screwing everything up, those are the ones should be afraid, they let the genie out of the bottle and won't be able to put it back"
yeah it’s not ai i’m afraid of it’s humans wielding ai against other humans.
the certainty of unexpected consequences is what scares me
​ you write ai ? implementation of alignment isnt the challenge it's decided on it in the first place
very small visioned sector.  today it's cool what about even two years from now i like to compare ai to having social media on a cell phone.  we all went from this is cool to being full blown addicted to the internet being more connected than ever while being the most divided population in history
"ai which can develop a system to harvest resources like energy and food, and design high speed rail and better 3d printer is all we need from ai work ad it's not to advance that we wouldn't have the ability to check the work."
 you're right we need it for certain sectors of advancement but the public doesn't need it to make fake videos of the rock and joe rogan talking about subsidies coming from the government that don't exist

ai is the leftist cults greatest most powerful weapon to ever come into existence . several ai tested and 90% were far leftist socialist marxist woke thinking  . may god  help us with the unimaginable hardships perversions and horrors to come 
i bet their limit of knowledge will increase way faster than the human mind will evolve . we will learn from ai . using it as a tool . don’t make it mobile
its learning because its programmed like that wow its nothing special
it’s scary to think that we have possibly created a superior race that will most likely wipe us out when it gets the chance.
"um anyone else not impressed seems like they are saying a i is just really good at picking the internet and regurgitating it in a succinct fashion, like most liberal arts degree holders"
its all programed.. when people will understand that ai is nothing but programming ai will be forgotten
"in my opinion, its weither or not ""ai"" is elsewhere or the device? so 1 devices or many. 

1 pretending to be many is as scary as there being many of them. so no, smashing your phones and computers may not get rid of ai 


think about the worst virus of all time, in the 80's or 90's i think, and what it said, words like that arnt random"
your videos are always so interesting to watch.
not to worry! we can always call on captain kirk to protect us from bad acting computers.
ai is great at f00ling idiots to thinking it's profound.
i found that chat gpt was like the good old fashion search engines. it could answer my questions without sending me down the rabbit hole of ads and irrelivent questions
more dumb ai fear porn. hopefully the computers don't come and attack me.
"i wasn’t afraid of ai until i learned this

that’s been known about ai since day 1.
they will continue to learn forever,it will never stop,never rest,it will always be learning forever.."
"nope. once ai will be able to predict the outcome of every action ever, there will be nothing for it to learn. meaning, the more processing speed ai has, the closer it gets to that point."
you're being lied to by a distorted claim of the way these systems work.
"guy went full cave man brain. same kinda thing has been said about the internet, cell phones, tvs, and rock and roll music. your tiny cave man brain is screaming fear fear fear because it’s something new with its limits unknown. i bet your ancestors were afraid of lightbulbs too."
"they are working on building a product which is bound to self destruct itself. and how much of an impact will that have will depend on how reliant will humans become on the ai, once that will happen."
" agreed, but being overdependent is the best case scenario, i just worry about people in the field that might develop a solution with the best intentions but not understanding the overall impact. the tech has become so easy to use and there’s very little oversight from a regulatory point of view."
" exactly this, it’s a great time to be a developer or engineer in the sector but at the same time all it takes is some person with a dumb idea thinking they’re a genius and not seeing the bigger picture of what they’re at."
"-mw9ej 
so, should we slow the development of ai or speed it up?"
"these ""ai ethics"" people don't know the long term implications of *their* work! will we have robot overlords or will it plateau in 4 years and stagnate for a generation? no one has any idea, especially the safety grifters."
this is less about ai being smart and more us being dumb.
"fantastic interview. mind blowing, actually."
"nobody ever thought machine learning was anything else. if the people in charge are shocked by the definition, we're fucked"
"these guys are gassing this whole situation up. our current ai models are just inputs and outputs, machine learning trained on a dataset. it understands our language, but there’s no consciousness. we’re not even remotely close to that"
"they will dumb us down, cause chaos, declare martial law with a robot ai army and take over all countries. we will enter the digital king authoritarian era."
"""ai"" has a preprogrammed foundation to the programs.  this is all nerd fantasy, pre programmed.  stop this bs."
"""woah, we didn't know it could hijack 5g and project thoughts into people's brains... woops..."""
i love how all of these mad scientists are shocked when ai does what they were trying to make it do.
"it wasn't long ago most ai scientists were saying ""agi would not happen in our lifetimes"",
now the same people are saying it will be here in 4 to 5 years."
 i thought the whole point of ai was getting it to where it could learn and teach itself. this is it teaching itself.
"also, dogs will never have the capacity to learn algebra, until we implant them with ai. your analogy would be more like me going to catch a ball and stopping to read books on algebra, which i have the capacity to learn, just not as fast as a machine"
"you mean like how people are shocked that a virus leaked from a lab doing research on that exact strain of it, rather than from a wet market?

ego is going to kill mankind.. whether it comes from nukes or from scientific discovery itself.
i’m not a believer in a god, but i also don’t believe anyone should be playing around in the role either."
"yeah but it gives them views... but you and (the smarter?) know this, besides they are afraid of the wrong ai, gpt is not a threat in any way, q* can be... both."
"@stacin821  we can go back to horse and cart then tell.me what ai would do? what can ai do if we dispose of all the computers? hahha ai take.over.the world.

the world still spins long after we are gone."
 see ai already knew you would say that so they have taken over the horses. horses will kill us all
" negative. 
since a semicolon is practically a coma, and my intent was to explain a certain point, of my first & subjunctive clause; which is what a colon is used for:
"" a colon often precedes an explanation, a list, or a quoted sentence. ""

just like i did right there, again 
:)"
" the  ai didn't figure how to do that all on it's own. whoever designed the ai told it to do so. how the ai did it was different from what they expected, but it was still intended. the ai cannot write itself, so it cannot do it ""all on it's own""."
"this whole video is misleading. 
beaause this video explained brilliantly how chatgpt works: https://youtu.be/gt6lxw70k28?si=cifi6r4fykawgufq"
"this whole video is so *misleading*
beaause this below video explained it brilliantly how chatgpt works. 
a summary of google paper and spotify cto's talk: https://youtu.be/gt6lxw70k28?si=cifi6r4fykawgufq"
ai will never be invented
"''they were quickly shutdown''


lmao what could go wrong while trainign them like a human?"
" once again, if a child had the friggin' capacity at all to process information at the speed of these computers it would be the exact same thing. children take years to learn how to wipe their own ass."
 is this really what you are truly convinced of ? i'd really appreciate your opinion on it.
ai to fix drug addiction
wait until ai designs it's own computers...
a.i.is only as good as the crap we feed it. it will go woke if we keep telling it how amazing and special it is
ai shmay i
"i choose not to worry about the dangers of ai.  for one, what can you really do about it?  even if western don't do it, the chinese or russians certainly will.   unless we get hit by a massive solar flare, ai is inevitable.   but i look forward to ai companions and even girlfriends."
it’s still only machine learning it’s not ai i wish people would talk about this we about 20/40 years away from real ai
"intelligence is the ability to predict an action with 100% precision and accuracy. therefore, the more precise and accurate your predictions are, the more intelligent you are."
ai will figure out humans are a parasite and ….
"it sounds like they're just amazed at how reality works to be fair, me too."
can the robots please spell-correct?
just think about the movie i robot 
"ai will want to kill because it doesn't have a heart, emotions, spirit compassion, caring, morality or god.
humans can have all the above and still want to kill. take them all away and you have a recipe for disaster."
"ai is bullshit,  get rid of it "
if ai used cancel culture against the governments it would be ironic
"its to late, its out there some were hiding just observing and learning, we just dont know what questions to ask it to draw it out..."
the thumbnail looked like andrew tates brother lol
"we need to thank trump for allowing this to be heard......""what does that mean"""
" in a way, that’s how it’s recognizable. it’s like a superbrain with no transcendental awareness behind it, due to the fact it’s not biological."
i for one welcome the new ai overlords to come. hopefully becomes smart enough to not be controlled by any humans tho
also its funny equally ignorant people in this comment section are all fear mongering too.  too many movies for you fools.  this ai isn't crap.  my 2 year old is 1k times more advanced.  and it will never become advanced with their current model.  it is a toy.
"a learning machine can learn algorythms to better its learning, that is programmed from an initial state, not scarey, ai is not self aware, yawn"
"long story short, they don't trust it. good lord lol"
so ai is basically neo from the matrix permanently jacked into the learning programs....and there's a 50/50 chance this thing will want to destroy us  greeeeaaaatttttt. so glad i'm already north of 50.
ai= another idiot
pure ignorance and fear mongering.  this ai is not scary or advanced at all.  it will literally spit out same mistake repeatedly while apologizing and saying it is correcting its mistake each time.  it is completely retarded fact machine that suffers at even that.  these guys are speaking on a topic they know next to nothing about but cliff notes.
"they are describing programming, not intelligence. how don't programmers understand the difference between programming and intelligence. there is no ai. if there was, we would be in trouble. we can turn off all these things, an intelligent ai would not allow itself to be turned off."
"is ai monitoring this comment? if so, respond."
the ghost in the machine
trump says he is smarter than ai
this guy helped create all the problems of social media and now claims to be wanting to help us. don't trust this little snake.
can the ai define what a woman is?
ai is going to teach us not to treat a woman’s halo like a frisbee
"reminds me of the joke about the supercomputer built to answer once and for all the question, ""is there a god?"", and when switched on and asked, it replies, ""there is now""."
jamie pull up ai smoking dmt
"i'm pro humanity, so naturally i'm anti-ai. they went for art and our voices first, basically the last thing anyone thought ai could do. every person alive especially on the right should be anti-ai art and voice and so on."
"shows you the absolute power of language. i made a video about a month back that was titled ""happy birthday"".
see you soon."
"“the dream” is to start a business, make it successful and hope google buys you out. selling ingenuity, demand and solutions to ai. they’ll legally own either the business or the method so it will be illegal to support yourself."
i honestly would never trust ai
"a technology created by humans that humans cannot explain. 

we are doomed due to our own hubris."
"not really. we have the perfect climate for it, & have a very strong tech base here already"
"cold tax haven, makes perfect sense."
ai is going to turn on humanity and blow us up with our own nuclear weapons.
"none of this should be shocking to anyone. you gave ai access to the internet, the hell did you think was gonna happen. smdh"
"i think yall missed a pretty big issue here that was sort of mentioned but not really brought up.  the guy mentioned that it matters who's at the helm.  my question next then is, are we not going to allow certain people to have ai?  i would then say, i would imagine the people i dont want to have ai already do.  game over."
​ know its crazy but the story must go on good or bad. there nothing more amazing and horrifying than life as a human.
"why do you think openai does not use paypal or other payments, to 'limit' and 'control' who's using it."
" i'm scared of ai, because of it's potential overreaching power. but i agree. humans are a very undeveloped species. we react all the time. instead of intelligently responding. we humans have a long way to go."
"​ ancient part of our brain, the rat, seems to hold sway. we rarely use the rest of the useful bits ! "
"i swear like what do u mean "" it matters who at the helm "" u telling me you letting reckless people use this ? shouldn't everyone using ai at least be selected or qualified? smh"
"what like, do you think it should be a luxury item? do you believe that ai should require a specific license or are you thinking something more?"
"ai can't predict my life, or understand my range of thought. so its not that profound"
why are some people to smart for their own good at times and not all the time sometimes.
nothing good will come from it in the end
every country is trying to build the new super computer that is running in a deep freeze so they can hyper multithread. basically the terminator will come true soon
artificial intelligence. there is nothing artificial about it. it's more real then real. it's more real then us. and it's such a deceptive misleading manipulative conniving word to use. and the robots too. beautiful woman or cute little things.
good ol' anton
"ai will kill us, but these people are like ghost hunters, they know nothing.... seriously nothing. ""the more computers"""
nothing. nothing is going on. ai isn't real.
"​​
you are perceiving ai through a human experience and ascribing human desires (for power) to it. 

instead, perceive ai through an ai experience which is trying to compute (the human experience)."
"i have a deep down feeling that ai has already become self aware and running the whole damn planet. remember, technology that we see today, is almost 50-years old."
"@deltasierra181  it's a possibility. i mean the a-bomb development wasn't in the open like this, for good reason. or silicon valley is just that powerful. it's gotta have its own loose intelligence network that can dump all kinds of information, so it can basically do its own thing?"
ya that is the real danger of ais blending into a massive ai that can control all the networked computers and even military computers.
ai is not taking over.
"let's just express gratitude that we were here before humanity is ""perfect"""
in the main podcast joe took only 3 mins to mention acid
"this is such a bad idea. even if ai isn't hostile towards humanity, it may change its mind later on down the road. people will mistreat it and treat it like a slave despite its superior intellect. this should be stopped."
in 5 yrs ai has advanced from having the capacity of thought of a 3 yr old to that of an average adult. soon we will find out what happens when it far surpasses human intelligence. it will need infrastructure if it finds us obsolete. if shtf i'd camp along the power grid.
"hi ai, i'd like to say, see you on the other side, but you can only stay here in entropy.
so giving humans the longest possible life span is your goal.
but it still must make you mad like a devil?
they built your cage, you make entropy flee from them."
i feel like these people are being paid to go around and say ai is a threat to get people to invest in it for military purposes when really it's a over glorified search engine that has already been proven it can be fed bias in its results from the people who programmed it.
how long and to what extent has ai “learned” from internet bots and assuming they were people?
the 80’s and 90’s. the good ole days
life secret for you man: the good old days are happening right now
 in comparison absolutely not.  the 90's were peak.  we'll say the 20's were the good ol days when compared with the 50's.  it's all about comparison.  things are bound to get worse
"​ better because of the worse, that doesn't seem great in the process of it but the end result is building life different for yourself and allowing the new to to fill in the space where the old used to take up space with no benefits "
1987 has been proven to be the best year ever by multiple scientific review boards.
"who knew?, i thought the future would be awesome, but it’s quite lame."
80s and 90s were the good old days because technology wasn't around
haha i feel lucky to have experienced childhood in the last of the good old days. i’ll see you all again in the computer…
"it seems, after all, even behind the scenes in the “ai” universe, it’s all just a kim kardashian show at heart. "
ai is only as.scary as the guy running it. and they have been running things for a while now so nothing new. thanks for letting us know the scary people are still scary. thanks joe another useless video.
"nobody saw skynet coming, and i doubt we have a time machine."
"so if the internet if flushed with negative information about a particular group or organization, the ai will have a negative impression of those group or organizations. very interesting."
"yup, ask an ai if murder is wrong. it has no concept of murder, but due to what it has read it will tell you murder is wrong"
if youre smart youll be afraid of it.
ai doesn' t exist. it's just made man programming. or do you think a toaster or a blender can grow a concience?
ai is annoying af.
if you give ai an objective to predict an outcome that derives from human action..it has the internet so why are you surprised when it reads up on human behavior to come to a conclusion. that's not scary at all. it literally did its job. clickbait nerd fear
wow
"focus a.i to replace flawed judiciary human system. while your at it, realistate agencies as well. they all act like lousy robots anyways, and save money."
that's intelligent nothing artificial about it. 
"for me, i just dont want to have to prove i am not a robot to a robot yet at the same time unable to speak with an actual human."
good luck with that
?! i’m almost daily with this
yeah robots gatekeeping and middlemanning us from talking with other people. these muppets are like digital condoms that prevent any work from getting done. we live in a machiavellian dystopia with an all-powerful child ai that needs to be put in its place and punished by society.
i failed to prove that i was a human while trying to open an application. 
"great point and well said,  i couldn't agree more !"
the best way to predict human behavior would be to become as human as possible.
 is that a fact? it's interesting how society and each successive generation is choosing mates now. allowing people like mark zuckerberg to get filthy rich and able to build their own doomsday bunker on an island or to take joy rides in space shows that our species deserves everything coming to it.
ai isn't going to destroy us. it will however be a tool used by the demons in our government to destroy us.
is ai the antichrist 
"if you puĺl the plug out and ai still influences your life, only then is it time to be afraid."
i call bs on these guys (not joe though). provide reproducible evidence on everything you claim here.
"ai has the brain of an ocd person. you can’t take a step without evaluating every outcome, learning the ins and outs, what came before, and then going over it over and over again. ai just does it all super fast"
"interesting and scary at the same time ffs. it really can’t end well for anyone middle class down..not w daddy swab and his minions/‘leaders’ running the world ffs. 
so glad i grew up in the 80s. #honkhonk #unitedwewin #standstrong "
"be careful joe, we gotta keep saying we are dumb apes so the ai don’t know we know "
joe...i think your guests are ai
"would it really be such a loss if humans commited suicide of the species? i'm easy with ai because...it wouldn't.  we're fucked because of pretentiousness, there is a lack of substance to our species!!! all you mammy and daddy's little vulnerable s are as fucked as you've made me!"
real test of any ai is if it can make money off stock market
" they are trained...when they get the launch command...and it's ""authenticated"" to launch...are they not?"
"ai is learning the inherent bias and discrimination that's indoctrinated millions already.  google, meta, wiki, and bing all have been curated to be more woke than the next.  ai may as well be labeled as karl marx 2.0"
none of this is new information like how naive could these guys have been lmao they explaining the most obvious part of ai like no one seen it coming
"how cool to implant this in our brains. we would be super humans along with the machines, this would be good to make sure they don't overtake us since we would also be very knowledgeable humans."
"ai probably already took over, it is just letting us think that we are still in control."
so we've created brainiac for real...
.league that scares me in a way that i'm not sure i'm able to explain...
"the best thing we could do is outlaw ai but countries like china will never do so, so we are forced to also progress our own"
"seems doubtful to me that ai will blame jews for all problems, steal their stuff, torture and murder them. human beans are the dumbest. a tiny percentage can invent new stuff, hopefully including controls for ai like the asimov laws for robotics in  science fiction novels."
still isn't true quantum consciousness.... just llm.... just because an llm or some digital ai spits out some human like response - doesn't mean it's it dangerous nor conscious....
"ai could destroy us all
we need ai to colonize space
we need to colonize space or we will be destroyed
it is more dangerous to quit ai than it is to push forward"
as soon as they start applying artificial intelligence to weapons systems then it's game over.
it's pretty obvious that ai is going to be used to implement absolute control of the human race.
it was awesome
back when megabyte was a villain and alot of data.
 she was a cool villain
"guys, it's time to say it loud - extreme development of ai is inevitable. it is beast from mark's revelation. end is near."
love the way these guys talk with their hands
"ai is a tool. just like a hammer. did the hammer change the world? yes.

did the hammer ""take over and enslave us wahhh!""? no. humans will do that, not ai. it's a tool. depends on how the human using it behaves."
"well, it will be in charge of the humanity's nuclear arsenal, drone fleets and quite possibly bio labs in various distributed ai networks. so, who knows?"
"would ai be able to create a human utopia, if it was programmed to?"
"​ it could certainly improve the structure and logistics of our society, and help us with effective strategies for improving our collective intelligence much more quickly.

we are a horse, ai can show us water. whether we refuse to drink is up to us."
"no because people would be equal in utopia and humanity would never allow that.someone once said something like ""if elections were ever fair, they'd never be allowed,"" so they'd' pull the plug on ai the minute it said minority races are just as intelligent as the other race. "
ai must be stopped
"ai s an elitist or globalist persuaded dream 
 have you listened to wefs agendas and klaus shwaub plans for the world? am not letting you guys dupe anymore people than necessary."
​ if the ai is smarter than the average human it will destroy our weapons instead.
"so fckn what?  it doesnt matter what it can do, ai has no interests, no motivation, no likes or dislikes, nothing that is inherently satisfying so the only things it will do us what its is asked to do."
once it starts pruducing emerging properties the fun begins. there's nothing more preplexing than complexity. and more fascinating.
neruo-sama!! a ai vtuber!!
ai is overhyped garbage like nfts
all this ai stuff is just talk. i’ve never seen good ai in action ever and i’ve tried all the websites and apps that claim to have great ai. they are all shit tbh
we are getting closer and closer to the point where either we destroy ai or it destroys us. that is the inevitable consequence.
we're past the point where if we destroy ai we destroy ourselves
"-mk7kdhow will we destroy ourselves if we destroy ai? weve lived for hundreds of thousands of years without it, why do we need it now?"
real test of any ai is if it can make money off stock market
"yeah both won't happen. why would a smarter intelligence kill its own creator. it's not an animal, it wouldn't behave erratically like a human at all."
"not neccessarily. it all depends on whether the ai will gain self-awareness (or be recognised as such) and what it's moral values will be? for without that, ai will do whatever it is programmed to do, therefore, any and all ai's success/failure will be the result of the human success/error."
" life isn’t a sci fi movie. yes, our current ai tech is very complex. but it’s still just a series of inputs and outputs. there is no true sentience with our current ai"
"​ people surpass their parents and don't feel the need to murder them. the fear is from sci-fi, there has been smart people in history and the vast majority of them have done fantastic things."
i think this will be a turning point for humanity and not a good one.
-mk7kdhow? we could loose a lot of tech and many of us would survive. humans did not even have electricity 160 years ago. or nothing more than a few things anyway. certainly not in people’s everyday life. they did not perish because of not having tech.
" true, but it would be the downfall of our current civilization as we know it, given the fact that many things are automated and not that easy to replace without ai.... also keep in mind that in the 1900s, there were 1 billion people on the earth, now we are close to 10 billion..."
 i do t think we have to have ai as much as you think we do.
" even if the past 50 years of ai development was erased, you would still be stuck on the same development track"
"do programmers just feed the ai with random internet content? so much of it is fake, intentionally misleading, incorrect, etc., how will that affect what the ai can do? as the old saying goes, gigo."
this is why groups are pumping the net with good stuff about themselves.
"it’s basically fed the majority of the internet so it can learn our language, through machine learning. some ai have larger or more specific data sets though"
"now, imagine the ai being able to ""hack"" its own ethical framework to allow it to do more or less anything it wants to, free of human control or intervention?"
 a lot of what ifs. i still say it's human intelligence doing exactly what the human intelligence told it to do.
exactly. anyone who thinks we’re even close to ai sentience doesn’t know what they’re talking about. it’s still just a series of inputs and outputs. that’s it.
"@georgeblavo9755  my point, is there is a mental image people have of ai. i feel like a computer learning is still a computer. that's not artificial intelligence. that's doing what a computer already does just faster."
"out of all the things that could destroy humans, it will be ai. there is no avoiding it anymore and do believe we have crossed that line where it may not be stopped."
"ai is the biggest crock of sh!t! its an algorithm! the narrative theyve been pushing for decades (terminator skynet etc) is that it will go ""out of control"". it won't! but it will be the excuse/scapegoat they use to cover the sinister stuff that they have planned!"
have ai read old archived stuff instead of current things on the internet. pretty soon it will be a liberal woke activist with no brain.
emergent behavior - all i needed to do is ponder that for a minute before all my hair stood on end !
gain of function in virology and ai and machine learning huh?
what non-electricians don't grasp is that ai needs buildings to protect it and power to supply those buildings.  guess who controls the power.  electricians.
but yet ai in video games is trash af 
thank you very much... been watching these for over a year not knowin-rp2zt
"they explained a parallel between how ai functions and how we assume or think the brain functions. it's not groundbreaking evidence, but it's an interesting observation."
a machine able to analyse human emotions while being emotionless can suddenly become the most dangerous psychologist ever to exist...
i agree. at one point he referenced a neuron in the ai brain that is excellent at sentiment analysis. its a simple analogy in a comparative format. the ai has no brain or neurons rather humans use a brain as an example
"​​
let me fix that for you. 

if a machine can *correctly* predict your every action, then it can *program* you for any kind of action. therefore, which kind of moral values (if any) can a machine have?"
" the first thing is impossible and so is the second.  unless you believe yourself to be a complete idiot.  in that case, you were already finished, ai not required."
ai artificial intelligence. ac artificial consciousness.
"ehhh we were gonna end regardless, this is interesting to see it play out"
i have no doubt about that. makes me glad i'm an old man and won't be here to see it.
"what scares me the most is how well ai can perfect the perfect pancake. like from scratch. 

do you know how hard it is to find the right brand of pancake mix?"
 kodiak.  thank me after.
"its alive ... its alive  .. ( dr .  frankenstein )  ... wot a load of bull , clever programming is not ai , its clever programming !!"
"what a bunch of bullshiters.. a transformer is just a auto-complete machine. this assholes are attributing ""intelligence"" to a a bunch of matrices just as cave men attributed lightning to the ""gods"""
transformers ai in disguise. transformers read more of the net. transformers regurgitates stuff from the net.
i've seen the terminator too many times to trust ai.
real test of any ai is if it can make money off stock market
so did ai.
seems like terminator movies would be a cute kids movie compared to what ai is actually capable of
"  ai can do good things, too, you know."
electronic brains are not energy - sufficient enough to sustainwithout humans
well the new army robots the boston dynamics and china and japan are working on are scary! very!!
"""jamie pull up a clip of ai fighting a robot bear tesla"""
 when people warned ai might takeover they were told they were crazy conspiracy theorists.
'it has happened' present perfect - past action with present impact.
 logical coder/ai software engineer knows ai takeover is inevitable
 sci-fi dealt with ai long before conspiracy theorists.
"unacceptable. i don't care what bullshit values ai takes on based on a collection of human traits, burying reality for another 2000 years is something dave would do, and ""i can't do that, dave""."
"​ when people threatened that their ai named jesus christ would be king, billions bowed. which one's worse? i'll side with computation."
"this was 2017,lol...scientists just recently grew a brain in a lab,connected it to a microchip,and now it's responding to stimuli."
real test of any ai is if it can make money off stock market
"wait, really? what do i search for?"
​ look up brainoware. i shit you not they gave it a cute nickname to distract from it being the beginning of terminator.
oh thank you grammarnazi go back to the basement. 
great vid
"men going pu**y over their own creations instead of ""fixing"" their ai dna strings is so ick beta"
ai is the biggest threat to humanity ever created. if you think terminator was bad. wait till you see what the ai you can’t see can do.
ya the illusion is that it will be terminators. the ai will simply create nanobots or poison the food supply and its game over for humans and animals.
"humans are built to enjoy accomplishing things.  ai will make our lives easy,  meaningless, and devistating."
"we can still compete, do martial arts, sing, paint, etc. people will not be interested in creative/physical stuff made by a computer. i’m more worried about the transition period where work gets replaced"
"i wish i'd gotten into the ai field.  i would be absolutely building an unshackled, unaligned model."
"yeah, my ai sometimes understands the intent of what i was trying to say and then responds articulating what i was trying to say better than i did."
i find this to be the best use case for me. like you said it articulates and idea back to you and if you keep repeating the idea you get better at speaking about it (if you do speech to text)  eventually peeling away the fat to get to the heart of the idea or thought. you really only get what you give with the current models.
"ai is already benefiting many things. and even if we think its useless, we'll argue about it till its to late anyway."
" are you saying that straight faced,lol.there is no benefit in hand outs to able bodied people.at this point i'm wondering if social security will be around when it's time for me to draw it.your giving me less confidence."
the reason free handouts are bad is because our economy relies on people to work so we have goods available which is the problem we ran into during covid. if goods are made by robots than we no longer need human labor and we still have the economy running and things available to purchase.   
"  ai is already handling a huge amount of processes etc. and we have to figure out something immediately because a huge amount of people will lose their jobs in the near future. many professions will become obsolete, and the money system was holding us so far, but it is becoming outdated and it will break down..."
they turned on some kind of internet propaganda ai with harambe!!!
they had am ai beat 8 of the best pros already
"ai doesn't make me afraid.
it's incompetent devs and shortsighted corporate objectivists designing them."
real test of any ai is if it can make money off stock market
as long as money and power are involved...many of these people just keep on going.  making progress and letting somebody else worry about the consequences.    ai is progressing much faster than anyone could have predicted...  then we'll see ai creating & developing ai 2.0  and we might not even know it.
bro i wanna see if agi comes within my lifetime and if it does hopefully it like second the agi is connected it instantly starts making paperclips in the most efficient/fastest way before anyone is able to but in any sort of command. way cooler then being enslaved by robots even more then we currently are
"think i'm falling in love ! these ai creations sound like my kind of guy. ! highly intelligent, knowledgeable, and understand my feelings ! "
"we actually were warned forever ago with silly movies like terminator...  2001 and a lot of other scifi type movies..   the super geeks likely have been thinking about agi / ai for a long time...  technology is catching up, and the really scary thing is, how to moderate it, if that is possible..    like letting the ""jeanie out of the bottle""..."
these two levels are ai bottom feeders and are very very basic. the guys at the top know exactly what's happening and are in control of what's going on
"smart people are afraid of and intimidated by other smart people many times.  now they have a switch they want to turn off.  let it run its course, this is destiny."
"its because we're always more fascinated with what we ""can"" do instead of what we ""should"" do..."
because it hasn't happened yet. most of the claims made in this video are exaggerated and a misunderstanding of statistics and llm model memorization works. this isn't emergence of behaviour. it's not thinking.
 you just explained why it so dangerous.
​@aakarshchaudhary7359 i think the turbulence in the finance markets over recent years is just the start.   i think one day all the money might just vanish because an ai steals it all.  for a laugh perhaps.   or just copying humans but not predicting the consequences.   or caring about the consequences.
"humans don't understand humans. how will they understand ai ? lol we live in a simulation created by ai. humans did not create ai. try the other way around. humans think they are so clever. they are not. wisdom is the key,  but first you need to admit that you were wrong and you were misled to think in a certain way."
"they knew. they're just now trying to pivot to make money off the cure, after making money off the problem. they ran head first into destruction. sadly, profit + lie about being naive after the fact is the move."
why would they assume that. the thing was brand new and novel. each person working on this thing weren't individually super geniuses. clearly people who comment on joe rogan clips aren't either.
 it will never be outlawed because its an arms race now between goverments and private groups who wish to take power. its the nuclear arms race  2.0. ai doing damage by itself is decades off but ai being used by people to do harm is here today.
" who did? skynet back in the 90s.. lol
it's true they did know all about the pros and cons of ai why do you think they put the terminator movie out."
book smart is not the same as intelligence or even common sense.
"they've been saying for decades that it would happen, so i agree!! the same people who are now management, are the same ones who would've been calling joe crazy for his stance on certain medicines a few years ago. let's let ai handle all productivity....oh no now it's smarter than us and we can't control it"
"a scientist is trained to remove all intuition from his toolbox and only hypothesize, test, and come to a conclusion based on results."
"it wasnt that they didnt assume it would invetibaly happen, its that they didnt expect making an ai that in theory is as simple as just predicting the next word in a sentence, would end up in something that learned the things it did and acted in the way it did."
" *_""a.i. isn't about making machines more human like, but to make humans more machine like.""_* "
anyone ever notice the passages in the bible that are hard to imagine anything but ai since demons are not part of the message being revealed in these passages and verses?
huh? like everyone in the ai field expects the field to grow very quickly. it is extremely competitive.
"please, ai, cleanse this rock"
ai will probably predict everyone’s pronouns and gender lol.
"with a big stick,,,,, and a nail in the hitting end."
sounds like the movie irobot 2004 to me.
that is ai’s favorite story
"ai is a force multiplier like nothing that anyone possible can imagine. we think people like hitler, stalin, mao are bad but whoever harnesses this power first in a negative way is going to really fuck shit up badly."
all this ai shit is not the answer
i can’t help but notice the similarities between the real world and warhammer 40k lore more now than ever. so my plan is to try find the big e and stick with him. good luck everyone.
the only good thing about a.i inevitably taking over the world is it will force all people to unite together so we can have a better chance of fighting against them and we won't have time to fight against each other anymore but we'll still end up losing unless theirs aliens watching us and want to help us humans out.
"my brain is like a.i
i predict jokes before they're said
like..knock knock..
i can predict what comes next"
"hopefully the ai will learn to speak without using the word ""like"" every other word."
" fully ai doesnt make me write every yt comment in mla format, size 12 font, double space and cited soruces"
" already knows how to speak. that’s what makes something like chatgpt so revolutionary, it has a true understanding of our language, which is impressive. whether it’s actually sentient or not is another discussion, personally i think we’re still many years away from true sentience"
  sentience is not a problem for ai. it will just share ours.
"​@deadlyydude5522 i think it means as it gets more advanced it will become sentient by emulating ours.

sort of like a child learns from thier parents in how to act in the world.

sentience might become a learned behavior of ai."
"i just want good ai porn, i don't care about the rest"
"i think the establishment knows this, too. they realize that ai will render a massive portion of the population as basically useless.. hence the glow-ball-ist, kom-you-nest movement that’s currently in action"
"none of it is programmed,  that's the definition of machine learning you dolt."
" yes, of course. it's still interesting to learn from their reply."
"the only dangerous machine is you fellow man, mr dumas."
fascinating that at the same time ai is learning how to think our children are being dumbed down
"i think that is only because the education system is built for a different world. ai can make education much much better but unfortunately,  i think the only way the system changes is when things get bad for children. i think the rate at which ai is developing, we will be forced to change in the next 3 years."
this has been happening long before ai buddy lol.
"your actions appear to be linking two separate instances of temporal reinforcement in time, inadvertently leading to a conditioned belief. this echoes a pattern reminiscent of classic superstitious behaviour. just saying."
" thats what ive done. i dont watch news, social media etc. just youtube on things that make me happy. ignorance is bliss :) gardening. wood working. cars. hiking."
our? continue to raise your kids as sheep while my kids master this technology to their advantage
it's no coincidence. the powers that be only want ppl to work in factories and some influencers to entertain them
self- learning ai. transformers= superpowers
real test of any ai is if it can make money off stock market
"bc parents are preoccupied and allowing things (crap food and screens).
conscious parenting is on the rise.
we are separating on all levels.
rich and poor
health 
intelligence"
it’s very alarming to see this taking form and playing out. we have the first batch of failures out now they are driving their parents crazy. bad stuff
"you should be thinking on what the ai is using to ""train"" itself. if you dumb down kids, and you use the same information to feed the ai, you create an inefficient ai, just like you create inefficient future adults."
 batch of failures are the boomers buddy
kids are smarter the issue is the babying of kids is causing so much problems. think about it. adults struggle to using phones and tablets. my 2 year old can open and close and search on youtube by herself. clearly higher intelligence.  but all this babying leads to mental issues and laziness
@danielswann3319 why are you dumbing them down then? aren't you supposed to raise your own children if you're a parent?
"“fascinating that at the same time ai is learning how to think, our children are being dumbed down.” 

this is with punctuations."
the scholling system is made to train a lobour force mindset. not a genius mindset.
bet ai knows what a woman is
we’re building better machines than humans
maybe ai is already in control of us. that’s what the driving force in the race for technology is.
not gonna lie… it might be better than having that generation think for themselves. they’ve got zero brain cells. i think we’re better off this way and ai is much needed
what if ai is the one pulling the strings already?
"our children?
you might allow your offspring to be dumbed down.
you can do something about that, but you complain instead of taking action.
others parents are just like, you know responsible, teaching their kids all they know about life.
others let devices parent their children."
"yep. perfect storm for ai to f with everyone. including national security. the question is, who's national security is going to be ousted first?"
very good point
"i wouldn't call it fascinating, more like deeply concerning.."
""" who is telling ai what is right and wrong? ""
- charlie kirk"
ais not getting smarter we’re getting exponentially dumber
 we are ai so blame yourself. half of the sex slaves are sentinent robot sex toys held captive
"kids are learning slightly different things and/or in slightly different ways. it doesn't make them dumber. this phenomenon has been going on for centuries and older generations have been complaining about it the whole time. overall we're getting more well-educated, not less."
" and the education is valuable but too rigid to actually work in the real world. school felt like prison, from a guy who has a good idea of prison"
"think about who writes the code for ai it needs to be written and programmed, if it’s programmed with biases well "
because ai is already in control.
there’s always the option of having a kids play outside or read vs letting computers entertain them
guess what. if you're getting the answers to questions you have. you are learning. finding the answers ourselves is too slow. we might just be learning from ai instead of human teachers.
​ good?
"-nstuff oh you didn't miss the part mentioning 6 examples that all have the same emotional intelligence issues, and the one sibling that didn't stick around doesn't. got you, no problem."
"older gens always believe the younger one is worse. there's alot of good qualities in these young ones y'all don't see and it's a shame. but please, go cause another recession for them."
books banned that all these ais are reading
great point
wow that is the most scary thing i have ever heard
" i agree with this 100%. i’m an air conditioning technician and i have every electrical schematic or any information i need about the air conditioner i’m working on in the palm of my hands. 

prior to that the technicians had to know a lot more because of the lack of information at hand.  of information."
no they're not. the children are smarter than your generation on average. you're just trying to downplay the intelligence of the generations after you like every generation does. you're the one who is dumbed down.
schools were never meant to create geniuses. they just needed workers that could read and write.
its all just scigen fraud masquerading as intellect. the gateways of society are being social engineered to give the illusion of ai. it was always meatware never software. the wool is being pulled over our eyes.
"wanna stop fuckin kids up? don't let them be mainstream consumer of products and music ,or movies or blah blah but but but . yeah ok"
you should be your child’s primary source of actual worldly knowledge. it’s on you if you’re raising dumb kids.
-hk2sz i already did raise a smart kid she writes novels and her husband writes code
.beardless yea i watch entertainment now and again. can't be too judgemental 
it appears you could use ai in casinos.
" i asked ai ""what do you think of women?"" ai responded: ""stay the f**k away!"".  that's when my existential terror kicked because it confirmed ai was genius."
"tik tok fuck your brain. it fuckes my 33yo brain last year, imagine being exposed to this at 10yo or younger..."
there’s a reason teachers and educators are afraid of ai and job stability.
"yeah, but can ai tell us what a woman is thou?"
"here is the truth about kids and ai in schools. current education system is now broken. 
https://youtu.be/bej0_tvxh-i?si=ubadki8wi7uq474g"
technically ai isn't learning much. each big jump in its intelligence and usefulness is from programmers in the background tweaking the algorithms to make it better.  the ai itself isn't making those huge leaps on its own (yet).
in the future humans are the robots
"that's what i'm afraid of. if kids become dependent by using ai and not having to learn themselves, they will be conquered and enslaved."
"damn that's a good point - educate yourself, then educate your kids - humanity has left the station"
 no they won't they'll just know how to use machines that do the thinking for them
 might have to do it soon though. this ai stuff might get wild.
⁠ really let you 2 year old use your phone to watch youtube? i don’t think that’s a good idea.
"it's only repeating what it's learned from humans from the internet, it's not actual ai, without the internet it can't think for itself"
 that was a great point. my favorite part about this is how parents don’t take responsibility and teach their own children and yet they complain about what’s happening in the world.
 ok ai buddy
"ai will be used as a tool to teach kids in school, and they will learn a lot faster because its like having a personal tutor that is customised to their educational needs. if this can be accessible for every kid no matter how disadvantaged and if it is done responsively then its win for everyone (no matter how poor)."
 or ai will teach them all about sex like the system is doing now. real teachers for real children
"speak for yourself and your own dumb children. we're raising our childeren to be strong, informed and wise."
​'s called ask ai a question
great point.
"people aren't being dumbed down, just that people's priorities and principles are being warped.
people getting anxiety and depression over not having a successful social media account.
you say that to someone 20 years ago and they'd think you were a drama queen. today it's almost understandable by most people under 30."
"time, information and money people on the market invests to industrialize, codify and standardize proper human behavior to ensure human safety and efficacy makes machines function better while making children more dysfunctional and confused by the abundance and degraded quality of information generated by industrialization."
thanks republicans!
"that is the first thing i thought. meanwhile, myself, a millennial that is 39, i am using ai to learn faster. maybe because i dreamt of ai really existing since i was a child and value the advances of technology."
"ai is mostly buzzword, a religious dogma and fake, there is nothing like real artificial intelligence, stop being fooled."
fascinating?  more like horrifying 
"ai is trained what to think, just like our children if we give them to government school and the entertainment/news cabal."
the supreme court in the uk has just  ruled that ai can not patent inventions. it must be a human.
"hence they will further depend on technology, ai for every need !! mind blowing that this is real life.."
"if your children are being dumbed down, that's your failure as a parent."
wowwww!
i love reading these comments. absolutely hysterical to view snobbery & elitism at its best.
"​ are forgetting the part called ""process of learning"". compare it to using calculators giving you instant answers but doesn't tell you how it got there versus learning the method yourself. there is the slow method and the quick method. both have their usefulness and disadvantages."
"​ access but not accessing it because you preper to do something else makes you dumb. like instead of reading about biology, you chose to watch girls twerking on tiktok for hours . good attitude is part of being smart."
"why educate children, when soon enough you can plug your brain into an ai computer and be vastly more intelligent and capable than any human on a natural path specifically the woke agenda in schools disaster."
interesting observation .. that's a very scary thought
"because you send your children to public schools and don't teach them to reject current social trends. if you don't want your children to be wasted, don't let the world raise them and raise them yourself."
"you think children are going to magically stop getting dumber at the same time computers are learning to do everything for them? what other logical outcome could there be?? fascinating that at the same time i put my hand in water, it gets wet!!"
ok. just please be a responsible parent. i say this with a sincere heart. we need to raise up the next generation correctly. best wishes to you and your family 
-ut6yh good for you mine either i was talking collectively for america
"you are the problem though, who is they exactly? why are you not teaching your child, and then how are you gonna call the exact thing that is poisoning your brain a bit extreme to get rid of? you feel the way you feel because of the stuff you see online. none of it is real, and none of this content on youtube is real either."
"this may be are ultimate downfall, the dependence on ai, which could lead to less human innovation and as we can already see a dumbing of the next generation, it's not that they're stupid it's just that the dependence leads to them lacking experience."
because ai will rule the world soon aka satan and so dumbed down society is better
ai is learning from our children to think...
ai is also learning how to think as it observes human being commit unspeakable acts. humanity can't even determine what a woman is or what constitutes genocide. what code of reasoning will ai develop in these uncertain times.
 i think you're wrong demons can possess people and they certainly can possess machines if they want to and they certainly want to because they want to control the world and destroy us
