i don't think robots are gonna be as much problem in the future. sure you can make some machines but then resources on earth are limited. also it seems more expensive than an actual human working. but the real problem seems to be impersonation and job loss. i think the next advancement we need in technology is on cyber security area.

"allen musk dogle baaz hai , khud bolta hai a.i. danger hai or khud hi invest kiya hai open ai me"
"it is hard to believe in the quote that says ""ai will not take your job, a person using ai will"""

"chatgpt has closed down many job opprtunities like content writing and things involving creativity, now people assume everything is being made by ai and hence ai detectors have been made so even if your work is genuine if it is detected then you have no scope sadly."

artificial intelligence is going to impact everything it's endless and can help you to study as well to create fake porn
dhruv is not pregnant but never fails to deliver
"artificial intelligence can lead to invasion of privacy, social manipulation, and economic uncertainty. but another aspect to consider is how the rapid, everyday use of ai can lead to discrimination and socioeconomic struggles for millions of people"
most demanding info done by dhruv rathee  really impressive  every one should deserve teacher like dhruv rathee

"the fact is ai will cut a lot of jobs because every company want to maximise profits and the first step is cutting top to down high salary jobs and most of us are useless in the workforce considering how efficient chatgpt is. 
anyone who unlocked and realised the full potential of chatgpt for software development can relate the risks."
i think in future the jobs that will be secure are mostly sports and entertainment

"wow
informative "
thank you for explaining so perfectly
ai could have come up with a better script than this one.
what is there for the rest of us do?! there are at least a half dozen things i can think of to do before working. first i would have my ai figure out how i can make money and not work. i mean acquire a passive income.
ai will eliminate climate change and cure all diseases by killing us all
"he's back, and he's on fire!!!  thank you jon stewart!"
if the workers who made the ai could own and therefore control it then all this would not be a problem
they don’t even know how ai works. yet they make these predictions. we will see..
"i think that the rapid change that ai would bring would also make people realize that jobless people also need a way to live. and if there's nowhere for them to work, i hope something as simple as ubi would be considered. that or... well, we will have to learn history again."
"one little detail, no electricity, then no ai!"
this is why i’m so glad i’m going into the trades.
is ai going to clear my hillside before fire season ?
"the craziest thing was the ""tech bro"" saying ai's better than fire or electricity. i mean, i don't mean to blow any minds out there...but ai wouldn't be possible with the electricity to power the computers ai run on."
"ahhh, don't fight it.  love the comment about coal workers can be ""up skilled"""
so.... artificial intelligence is more profound than the sun. we can utilize artificial intelligence to create the sun....globally.....as easy as the sun can do it? really!?! i doubt that.
"i use ai to help me with my youtube comments because i have dyslexia... my comments now make sense 60% of the time, every time. "
"this is pretty much a social and economical problem. 

when ai is at it's peak, almost everything that's ""business"" related will be done by ai! which means that we need a new economical system. 

don't you agree jon?

 (much love from algeria)"
this whole video is so dumb. machines have been replacing people for hundreds of years but the unemployment lines stay about the same length. the cost savings generated by the automation increase demand for other products creating new jobs. pick up a book jon.
"we are taking a technology that can exponentially increase all of humanity's productivity, and instead of making everything better, we enrich only a few people, and at the end of the day they are the most worthless group, it's the workers that built ai and get a paycheck and a pink slip"
ai has the ability to free man from work. the capital pigs will eventually fail.
"its almost like capitalism is toxic/lethal to the majority of humans and other animal life. 
capitalism is not based in sharing, kindness or best practices. it is based in serving thy self above all else, period."
"just now becoming obvious that the set up for things to go off the rails is being laid? information is power! thats imo why we still call pocket pcs. ""phones"" but a laptop that makes phone calls is a ?  iphone is mini imac. ai is mixed w\mini imac. one could control information? control information? control ???"
"get an xray lately jon? 
search ""vignettes of modern radiation workers"" 1979 from the mit vault with john g. trump who invented the xray machine and particle accelerator"
ai solving climate change is simple. remove humans. problem solved
boomer opinions about ai do not matter
"electricity is needed to run ai, so if electricity fails, then ""the very baseless fabric of our vision... shall dissolve, and in this insubstantial pageant faded, leave not a wrack behind""."
the more tech the less jobs.. the lazier we become... we use less of or brains etc...
the govt not knowing how ai works is not as scary as the people who program the ai not understanding how it works. it's already to that point. they have no idea how the machine learning llm and everything else are coming up with a lot of the results. it's that insanely complicated and above our human minds.
i can hardly wait for ai to take over. universal income and just plugging my mushy brain into a receptacle everyday. ahh the american dream
ai = automated intellectual property theft
10 surprising jobs for humans in the ai era!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqjugdkrbqi
"wrt the first item, women have been tailgate art long before biden..no outrage?"
how to pay for that health insurance with no job even if the disease has been cured by ai :)
at least be happy ai didn't ban this video :))
"is ai going to fix sam altman's extreme vocal fry? imagine being that rich, but also not having anyone want to listen to what you say for longer than 5 seconds."
"welcome back to the daily show, jon stewart. now, where were we?....."
most people don’t realize this but it’s shadow companies like blackrock and vanguard that control large corporations that are pushing for ai. these investor companies are driven by pure greed. since they control large numbers of voting shares they are able to dictate policy (such as headcount reduction) to the companies they control.
so htf do we all pay the bills?  like.... pay us and let ai do it
"it is a big con job to make money for the already morbidly rich. it is more dangerous than fire and electricity. it will remove jobs, and those of us remaining with jobs, but we will work even longer hours."
anybody that can throw coal into a furnace can learn to program?!? really?!?!? wow! :o
"yeah the human tax also know as people, or the whole reason we have an economy. if no one is paying the human tax who are you going to sell your products to ? i love how tech bros have basically thought through the first step, and always fail to go any further."
11:42 - 12:01. america's elected representatives declaring their lack of qualification for the job. brilliant!
it's the height of hubris to suggest that ai is greater than the very thing that even makes it possible - electricity!!! morons!
true for computers having no humans would be great...
how can they stand there and say its horrific with a straight face
i'm wondering who put the toast in the toaster??? haven't any of these people watched scifi tv where ai tries to destroy mankind??  from what i'm hearing genz is using ai to mostly create crude pictures and artificial girlfriends.
"""it would appear as though joe biden is restrained in the back""
legacy media moment...."
arguing that ai is a bad thing because it will take jobs is as dumb as blocking the transition to clean energy because it will put coal miners out of work.
ai is evil!
"... ai ----- a new term for the antiquated term ""computers""  (ai hype is generated by walls street ....so invest now)"
who watches daily show? ever since all this for wokified none of this is ever watched by real world people
excellent 
"and when ai starts spitting out bad data without enough people to check the work, they will blame the remaining workers for not spotting it"
"the point should be that ai can achieve its utopian potential if its in the hands of the people and/or workers, and is open and transparent for all to use. in the hands of microsoft et al it'll just replace jobs and generate profit."
"""it is brutal if you think like a human"": ""machine men with machine minds and machine hearts."""
"love you jon, but you are so far off here it's ridiculous. start getting your head around the idea of post labor economics...most jobs are going to disappear, simple as that."
yeah i've spent a lot of time researching ai and how it will effect our world and let me tell ya... it's more frightening that it sounds. and the experts know very little about what's gonna come which is.. comforting.
"i don't agree with everything that jon says, but he's amazing and funny as sh**. but i feel cheated bc i thought he was coming back for real but it was just on certain days of the week. or, one day per week or month or something..."
"john stewart does not understand ai or what it is, not even close."
companies using ai must have to pay additional taxes... to provide everyone with a basic monthly income.
ai will be the end of us all. fiction is truth on this one!
the day robots learnt to fix robots it’s over 
jon! your so amazing! thank you for coming back! we need you brotha!!
the thumb nail for this video feels like something a skynet employee would make
you actually have to use ai to beat  hiring systems now. yes. to get a job you have to use it.
"i already can't find a job to literally save my life come on and that's in today's world this generation in any current generations existing now will not be part of this rapid ai expansion, as we don't have the capability to learn the skill set"
he’s amazing
ai ?? the end is nye sky net will destroy humanity !! and it will do it with a really bad austrian accent !!! i be back !!!! 
brilliant
if you think ai is going to need people to defend it. eventually ai will be comming for your jobs too. when is the last time p. biden shoveled coal?
so glad this man is back.
"although quite recently, ai agents do *already* exist. they are the digital equivalent of ""prompt engineer."""
i'm happy jon came back :)
the only thing ai will be used for is to subversively enslave humans... that's literally it
the outrage over the biden decal is amazing
"absolutely, ai will improve the quality of life... buuut, not for everyone. :)"
"the same old arguments that were posited about any automation where people even sabotaged the machines in fear that they would replace people, that was some 250 years ago!"
politicians without a clue! whe are f**ked!
"ai, giving us all the time in the world while no longer having any money to do anything."
"yeah, they want to implant ai into our brains, so they can control us because they need. robots or the walking dead to produce their products"
just excellent !!
"well the whole idea with technology is the reduce the amount of work we have to do, duh.
it was inevitable that technology would progress to a point where capitalism isn't a viable option to maintain society."
"it would be nice if the media would stop calling generative algorithms, ai. they are fundamentally different."
jon you are right and making a joke out will help us digest it better thank you
i didn't know jon stewart was back! (i'm in australia) this is awesome! he is the funniest guy ever! 
i already like ai more than i like people
i wouldn’t have an issue with ai replacing us for work; but when we stop working what kind of assurance can you give that we can still function apart of an ai/human society? wonder if elon musk nerutonlink could also factor into what future we might have. the problem is ai right now is only being used as a tool for business to make more profit.
so the people poisoning the supply chain. forcing ai to lie and hide truths are going to profit the few. while starving the many. and thats humanity's greatest gift. homeless jobless everyone  ? great work he weakest members of society great job
"i am 2:30 into this video.
i just came from this video https://youtu.be/cddfv3pg8eo?si=pefblgksc98s_plq
i had no idea jon was back on the daily show after that awful trevor noah. yes i live under a rock apparently.
i'm definetly watching this daily. love you jon"
"given the state of the entertainment industry, yeah, ai is a massive improvement in life for me."
"anyone seen the famous mcdonald's scene in the michael douglas movie ""falling down""??? 
so why shouldn't people be replaced by ai when most have no compassion or common sense because they don't want to do the job in the first place?????"
ai always came with the promise of labor replacement. no one was hiding or covering it up. it's weird to to frame it like the heads of that industry never acknowledge or talk about it. you cherry-picked the optimistic segments of their interviews. some of the same clips came from hours long projects where they talk about the dangers and downsides.
"back in the 80s-90s they were making movies where ai took over the world, killing off all humanity, and now we’re inviting it into our homes"
"it is disturbing because of what it reflects about the mindset of his supporters, and by sharing it, he is encouraging that mindset. see january 6th for details."
"clearly, we need to replace investors and executives with ai, and stop paying them entirely across all industries."
ai image generation and content generation are not remotely the same thing
"when someone like zuckerberg promotes ai, you know it is bad and that it is time to pack up and run.
or ban it."
ian over at timcast irl would be awesome if interviewed on this topic.
these people are just religious zealots but for ai
"ah vanilla bean ceo saying ai is more important than the first fundamental techs ? like fire, cloth/textile, the wheel. jump started civilisation while tech companies just destroyed it for the better half of the last two decades..."
jon is the best. love his comedy!
ai doesn't exist. we have not created artificial intelligence. no robots still don't learn and teach themselves. they still memorize what we have digitized. no real thought.
ai = all indian + mark zuckerberg
what...! i cant wait for main media to be gotten rid off!
ai is gonna make our lives better?! they said that about computers. fool us once...
"thank you john, you have been missed"
"wait! are you saying i wouldn't have to work in an underpaid meaningless job, and i could instead focus on what is actually important to me? that sounds awful."
dont put your eggs in anyone basket that is claiming self learning ai its not something we as people can wrap our heads around yet
"thoughts on ai. anytime you ask, ai things about itself it doesn't have a reaction that would be seen as smart if i ask what would you look like if you could be anything and it will then do a preset reactions on how it is and what made it.
 showing that ai is a false term use to just grab at the name its not smart just made to look that way"
"i lost my job last week because of ai. i'm a translator and my bosses decided that it's better to have ai doing an ok job than an actual human even correcting it. it was never my dream job but still, a bit surreal"
i'm not really worried about ai because the computer is only as smart as the person programming it. trash in out.
ai + basic income
"ai is a big scam - just watch this latest incarnation crash and burn and all these ""ai founders"" will be in jail in a few years."
"there is the need for a deep 'fake commity' to monitor and maintain what is real and what is fake, that is mirky water, to judge in such a way, it is preposterous"
even if they replace the human with ai to create products and services who the truck are they going to sell them to if we are all out of a job? 
ai will cure diseases and climate change by removing the need to have people. what's so hard to understand and like about that
"""ai"" is just clippy with a bigger database. useless and annoying"
"14:20 except... the first real replacement ai has been doing has been targeting artists. so music, visual arts, etc are some of the first to have major struggles."
i see the ai pics of trump in black neighborhoods as more of a joke than anything else. its so prosperous we know they’re fake.
"ai antichrist international ,un united nicolaitans"
what is the solution here? stop investing in ai? not happening.
"ideally, ai could take over labor intensive tasks (like using pattern recognition to find cancer), freeing up people's time for, like, art and hobbies and relaxation etc. but companies are just going to replace labor, no plan for the people who won't have money to live after they're laid off."
excellent
"so... with no employees earning an income, how is the consumer supposed to survive? how is the economy going to continue? we would all re-train as ""prompt engineers""? doesn't sound like they've fully thought this through."
"so far ai turned into just better google, better stock photos, and better lsp for coding."
"looking forward to robots to do maintenance on at my job. also loving how much i’ve learned from chat gpt. health, science, art suggestions, i’ve learned a lifetime of information in less than a year. talk shows like this are misinformation for the ignorant. entertainment. not truth."
anybody else’s ai spring to life when jon asked seri a question?
wow
if they won’t protect our jobs from being shipped overseas then they won’t care when robots take our jobs. they don’t want to pay for labor period.
i really am thankful for ai. i'm so happy that i'm able to starve to death now that there are no jobs ror me to do!
"so thanks to ai, we'll all have plenty of time to do things make music or visual art. oh, wait... these companies are already starting to use ai to remove the human element from that too."
i do so love jon stewart.
"it was today i found out jon stewart is back. trevor was incredible, but jon coming back is like revisiting childhood. trevor and jon, legends."
"replacing labor is great, but our society isn't set up in a way to do it properly. in our current system, if labor is devalued then humans become devalued. as technology continues to improve productivity and replace manual labor, we need to rethink what we consider a fair and egalitarian society."
"if ai replacing humans it's gonna increase unemployment, no? why is more unemployment the dream? how the government gonna keep that much unemployed people alive and well?"
 that was great. 
"wow! the economy will be so driven by automation, most of the money will be able to be refunded as ubi to the everyday person to fund innovations! right...?"
cure climate change? hahahahaha...when will we glorify real intelligence than this artificial version of the real thing.  humanity is under the spell of feudalist wannabes.
"ai's potential to relay the contents of wikipedia to us....  wake me up when we ""actually"" invent ai."
so a boomer doesn't understand ai. shocking!
"if you have been on facebook lately you can see that a lot of boomers, basically all of them commenting cant see the difference between the video game gta and real life and they think insanely fake looking ai made images are real too. extremely disturbing."
"the world witnessed a groundbreaking moment as china-based netdragon websoft appointed an ai program named tang yu as its ceo. this ai-powered virtual humanoid robot was entrusted with supporting decision-making for the company's daily operations.

that ceo you showed seems artificial, would we even know if many are?"
"i love this is just a bunch of people complaining about ai even though most people literally have no idea how it works. 
"
#opensourceecology ai assistants for all of us to make our stuff at home.
"ai is so power hungry that it will exacerbate climate issues, instead of solving them."
"as a professional drummer, that last bit still hit home pretty hard even though machines have been replacing my skills for the past 30-40 years. look out songwriters..."
"jacques ellul in his 1960's book ""the technological society"" predicted: regular trips to the moon; the end of poverty and disease; women who's biggest difficulty will be how to use their leisure time...all by the year 2000. 

a.i. will be a disaster. these cheerleaders for ai are delusional and deliberate."
rule number one is anybody that watches daily show is not smart enough to understand technology
"in a homage to the movie her, i got chatgpt to say happy wedding anniversary to my bro and his wife, and it did it so well."
"to say we are seeing the infancy of ai is probably underselling it to a level that will far eclipse our capability of understanding or imagining. if you think humans are smart, expect to be truly humbled in the coming decade(s)."
"what could go wrong?  ask ai, it will tell you the truth. by the way, its truth is just a statistical calculation. are you feeling lucky?"
i'm actually impressed. we reached cyberpunk dystopia quicker than i expected.
"""i do renounce ai, 
""and all his works, 
""and all his pomps!"""
"met a dude from microsort msn, him and his whole team were laid off from the sports department for ai. he was there for over 10 years as a sports writer for msn. now it's all ai automated."
"what john doesn't understand is, if you double the intelligence required to make toast, you've got someone that understands quantum physics.  in 5 years, ai could absolutely be curing cancer."
"despite the ""retrain workers"" mantra by each of the presidents, not once have i ever seen a society-wide retraining effort... not once. just saying."
"they forget to add the words ""for us"" when they say ai will make things better!"
i think that people should leave all of the work to ais and robots. the job that won't be replaced in the near future is the need for bipedal self replicating assault cyborgs with limited autonomy. praise the omnissiah!
"just maybe, ai will make this show funny.  i nearly laughed at the biden joke...almost had me."
"""generative ai"" is based on the connections between words, images and sounds to other words, images and sounds that computers notice by being feed billions of pieces of it all. that's it. it's blind connect-a-dots that doesn't understand anything. it parrots what it finds."
ai can help you learn new skills
it promised to replace me. waiting to see how this movie ends.
i can't wait to become an indentured servant to a billionaire overlord who controls the ai technology.
"if anyone would actually show up to work, this would be less of a threat! 
love jon but this is extremely biased and silly reporting"
"""ai will help us solve very hard scientific problems that humans are not capable of solving themselves"" in the meantime back ai manufacturing company- um sir, i am having trouble figuring out how to program the ai to do this scientific problem. who knew it would take an understanding of the problem itself to program ai to solve it?"
ai will definitely make it easier for government and news to lie to the american citizen.
ai
"hang on, is jon back on the daily show? i'm so confused, i thought he stopped years ago."
first world problems ... we get an assistant! yaaayyyy!!!!! 
"""our ai technology is replacing you, but don't be mad! you can go back to school and learn to support the very technology we replaced you with."""
"jfc, old people yelling at clouds. ai is awesome."
wait!!!!! hold on!!!!! stew beef is back on the daily show..... ????  when did that happen.....??
i hope we are back to being able to laugh. js is helping us get there. so funny! loved it!
"they have ai precisely backwards. where we are looking for something to do the dishes and scrub toilets so we can do the creative stuff, the ai is trying to take over creative work so they can employ cheaper humans to scrub toilets."
not only those people don't understand ai. nobody understands ai. not even the biggest ai experts in the world.
more time for humans for thinking.how can a father puts bread on a table for his familly.nice.
humans to worship ai?
without electricity ai?
"the annoying thing is, it really could make life so much easier and the work week so much shorter if we just kept paying people the same, but replaced a lot of their work with robots"
"ai won't be our assistant, it will be our boss and we will be basically body surrogates for the ai until robots overachieve humans in the physical world and become cheaper to produce and maintain. then we will be 100% obsolete."
yes lets all be cutting edge educated ai/ machine learning engineers. that's a pathway that applies to the whole public.
"personally, i think 99.98% of ""ai"" is lies and false promises, just like ai has been since the 1960s. you promise to get funds."
"""now i'm making ai toast!"" hahahahaahahah  rfk 2024!!!!"
"this is no problem. we must simply pass the gains of productivity on to labor instead of capital. 

ha! now that’s funny stuff there."
" hillarious !!!! also, disturbing.  tech companies are obviously lying to us. what can we have congress do about ai & robots taking jobs? like if you agree."
all the right people are opposed to ai and bitcoin.
"but they will need people to fix this ai cuz it will break down something these "" engineer"" do not think of"
"tbh jon stewart is only funny to boomers, tds could have brought on so many other better comedians  thanks jon for making my parents laugh 10 years ago but pls go sit in a couch and ramble abt politics by yourself now..."
ai has nothing to do with jobs and replacing jobs. it’s a measly tech just like any other made to push its way into your home aka consumerism so that the industry doesn’t wither. it just needs a fkn idea any idea for you to grab onto cause it thinks you have nothing better to do than cater to it it would rather you withered for it to succeed you.
anyone that can throw coal into a furnace can vote an ai ignoramus out.
"if ceos suddenly stopped showing up to work, companies would continue to function perfectly fine. workers create value, not ceos."
"welp, this is the epitome of capitalism. making the most money. ai is the best way to do that, so it will happen. hang on tight!"
hopefully my boss cant afford a  new ai dump truck.. pretty sure my job is secure for now.
no respect for the clown's views but great comedian
"ai is for money and power, not for humans and its all bait and switch like you said. time-saving, making room for more valuable things etc, these are all the marketing speech. ai is a weapon of mass destruction in more than a few ways."
"help me not think about this madness

wait one last thought before i check out, if i invent a robot to do my job do i still get paid?"
"it's like the cloud....this ""intelligence"" is on someone's computer"
"capitalism and ai dont mix. youre missing the main point that everyone seems afraid to talk about. we dont need new jobs - we dont need jobs. let the corporations (and hopefully eventually government) make tons of money, but then give the working class a hefty base income each month. i dont really see any way around this."
"ai is a tool, don't use a tool!
you're not going to have all the toolsz!!"
what people are talking about really is aig not ai... a toaster is ai
"i enjoy this show, but i need to remember his real name is jonathan stuart leibowitz. he's just another gatekeeper."
"thankfully, corporations have all of us who interact with their customer service chat bots working for free to provide the necessary interactions and training to improve their systems and doing their beta testing pretty much as unpaid employees.

* please provide your feedback on how we're doing!"
breaking the drumsticks is actually really impressive
why will ai replace the employees but not the whole company i don't understand ? eg. a prompt engineer could in theory replace a whole software service company instead of the company replacing the engineer.
"it's gonna be just like when we first got internet and smart phones, you're gonna need to learn how to use it if you want to in any way be a part of society. you can't work 90% of jobs nowadays unless you know how to work a computer or some type of ""smart device"". in another 10 years or so it's gonna be the same but just with ai."
such a weak take on ai.
says it in the name artificial
the reality of ai is there is no ai. we could never let it happen. we have to add our bias to win our agenda.
"they all want an ai powered robot ""person"" to do everything, all labor."
siri just opened up on my ipad when john said hey siri  thanks for coming back john stewart! we’ve all missed you! i love the daily show again!
"imagine in the very near future when you go to utube and you can not tell if what your seeing is real or ai, what do you do now? where do you go for news"
i love this man! i wish he would run - i think he’d win - i have republican friends and democratic friends and we can both agree to agree that he is wonderful- i would love to shake his hand one day as well as those who work for this show- as they bring me smiles when my life needs it most
i got cooler toys. that's all
zuck is actually very cool
one thing that doesn't make sense...if companies replace workers with ai...who will be the customers? if we all become unemployed how will we afford the goods and services the companies are iffering?
the world is a much better place when jon stewart is hosting the daily show.  jon is the daily show.
"if you don't think ai is going to change to world in a huge way, you're an oblivious mouth breather."
"the real problem is that the government will take it's 35% or so of any productivity gains, without delivering anything. that money should go directly to a ubi fund made up of stocks."
i have been replace by ai so i tinker with with videos. i used to be a visionary but now i am clueless.
"the people who don’t see the potential of ai tech just don’t understand how it works yet. despite the huge media hype around ai, it’s still so new and hasn’t been integrated into our systems yet and are far from reaching application potential. give it 5-10 years and it will be impossible to miss the implications any more."
"i'm glad he's back, he's so funny and smart, best stand up comedian "
"those same ceo's claiming ai will make our life better, also warning us that ai can be the doom of humanity and govs must regulate.  both are marketing pitches to get more publicity and sell more ai."
love seeing jon again. please stay!
"love that toast vid with zuck, he just takes it straight out of the toaster and pops it in his mouth unbuttered even, like its not 300 degrees. 100% normal human behavior."
"given the increased power demands of ai, perhaps we can all have jobs shoveling coal again."
"the man who
invented the machine gun thought it would save live because fewer people would have to be soldiers. humans are notoriously short sighted and able to find the darkest ways to use technological “advances.”"
neal mohan and the forty ai thieves
so dude says ai is more profound than electricity but without said electricity where is the ai...
"uh dunno what's goin on w daily show but cool to see jon back, still makes me laugh after friggin all these years but hope trevor's ok doing his thing.. "
"ai taking over jobs would be an amazing development if we were ready to deperiste human beings right to eat, be housed, and be medically taken care of from the amount of labor they provide to the workforce."
"wait im confused, is jon back ?!??!"
it's all a grift. there's no such thing as ai and large language models are already hitting their limit.
i wonder if in the future when ai is the norm in society if products and services that are “human made” will garner a premium.
and we will hold down the fort on toast. love it!
"ai like "" lavender"" ?????

an ai software that works autonomously to define who will be able to survive and who's to get killed????????

without any human surveillance????????

that ""lavender "" in the hands of the jewish genocide army????"
ai won't get very far without electricity.........
yeah the reality of ai now. same people said the internet was a fad the first few years
"i'm baffled on how technology has progressed in the last 20 years and how dumb people have become.... we were not ready for the internet as species,  even worse for ai....we need to reconnect with nature asap."
ah yes! ..i am still waiting for my paperless office and my clone...my driverless rv taking me to the beach in the morning and my starbucks drone delivering my coffee. ..isn't there an app for that already??
"i think if ai ran the economic benefits to society, all things considered, of having ubi sooner than later, i think it would say we should start on that sooner, giving us the time to figure out a way to stop it, while commenting on youtube."
"i missed jon so much, didn’t watch at all after he left. used to get high and watch the daily show before bed , we are back baby"
i'm not as worried about ai bias as opposed to human news bias... both are real. 1 is controllable.
"jon does realise that ai being used to understand, speak and ""make toast"" is not a mutually exclusive function, right...?"
not to mention that ai will be the fall of democracies.
i’m glad jon is back to hitting both sides when they are full of it. both sides tend to be corrupt and incompetent.
"joe isn't wrong. if you can throw coal into a furnace, you can be trained."
"makes me glad i am a union boilermaker. ai can't do my job. they tried to put a welding robot on the site once. it ""got stuck"" on the hook of the crane and ""fell"" 4 stories. let that be a lesson to any robots trying to muscle in."
"ai can take my job as long as it doesn't take my salary. that's the big problem.  the big catch.  but imagine a future world where everyone's basic needs to live comfortably become a standard entitlement and working is, for the most part, just a leisurely option for those who choose to do so.   hard to imagine but also very possible."
"ai would be great if we lived in a utopia. unfortunately, in a capitalist society, this is just going to be a tool to further the wealth gap in america an invalidate the human experience."
ai thrives in an environment called pursuit of gdp growth at all costs. it doesn't thrive in an environment called ensure the long term prosperity and health of people and the planet.
"brilliant, just brilliant. i love the pin you so adroitly wield against the ""idea balloons"" these people are floating day as reality.  thank you daily show, so glad you are back."
everyone will be replaceable by ai
"ai can’t think, all it does is regurgitate what other people have made. it’s a bs machine. at my company i’ve forbidden any use of ai."
"ai is the new nuke in the making,  but much much much worse and dangerous. hope i will live long enough to see how it all ends"
"it all makes sense now!
ai beats electricity. the thing ai runs on. 
programming is just as easy as throwing coal in a furnace.
the extra time not having a job is more art time and not homelessness.
who knew?"
there's nothing that ai is doing that's scary. it's always been scary how easy people are to deceive.
of course companies and entrepreneurs will happily donate their money to the government so it can redistribute the wealth that ai will produce for them... right?!?
wow...is she pakistani 
i love jon stewart
"1:26: yet we all waited with baited breath, many actively searched, until we saw it. when we finally got a glimpse..so anticlimactic."
"if employees are replaced by ai, who is going to pay taxes?"
"jon stewart for president. ..... he’s real life jokes aside... one of the most sane individual in usa.  who’s happen to be very funny. 
love this guy. when  i grow up i want to be like jon !!! jon joke matters, i can’t breathe!! because of his dry grumpy funny logical sarcastic humor. 
thanks mr jon . 
ps : i’m older then him. "
"universal basic income is the solution to everyone losing their jobs to ai, which is starting to happen and will increase dramatically this year.  when it hits ceo's and managers the gov will enact it."
what i really want to know is by the time all of this ai geniuses are talking about solving all of humanity problems with theirs new tec most of us are still cleaning our poo hole using our hands cover with a thin layer of paper and why a toilet brushes are still exist?
these will be the first people dragged out when the machines take over lol
"ai is going to make a lot of people unemployed. don't see how that is gonna ""make people's lives better""."
they won't use ai to cure diseases!  they're making too much money offs sick people!!  they always lie about what they'll use new ideas for!  i've been watching for over 60 years!!  greed always wins out no matter what we're talking about! 
"ai is the final barrier for computers to take the world... and there's nothing we can do about it... it was science fiction a few years ago, now it's reality."
replacing us in employment would be great if we implement universal basic income.
"ai can now replace all employees of all companies - will be what ai will say's, just before the humans revolt.

mortem aut triumphum"
"wow, this was actually funny... jon stewart needs to stop with politics and just be funny."
"more brainwashing. if you can't see what their plans are. you should sue your brain for nonsupport. 
it's all lies. men, haven't cured anything ever. jon's a great comedian, but this is not funny."
"7:35 saying the quiet part out loud. yes, that's exactly what they think of us, as a ""tax"" on a spreadsheet. they're itching to replace us all with machines."
ai is not an invention and will never do anything creative or extraordinary! ai is spyware that searches all computer engines and claud data and steals the hard work of people on the internet! it is googled with high speed and precision! nothing to be excited about!
just goes to show you the intelligence level of liberals.
he's the best. period.
love jon but not the best take. ai is going to give us the capability of an easier life. whether or not we allow ourselves that privilege is tbd
that joke where the punchline involves knowing what an answering machine is. yikes!
"ai advice in canada ""sounds like you qualify for our maid program."" 
but it's only allergies!"
"ai can't replace male prostitution, so i still have that.  already thought about using prison as a retirement, housing, meals, healthcare all provided when i have nothing else"
ai is a joke. the only thing it’s done is replace a barely understandable call center rep with a chatbot that doesn’t even understand your question! 
ai could easily write every episode of the daily show and you would all still laugh
ai can definitely replace stewart
i love ai. i hope it keeps advancing faster.
yes !randomly scroling  and seeing jon stewarts daily show is back! i couldnt preaa play fast enough.
the 'reality' of 'ai'?
"evolving fast!  major issue facing human species!
 satire/commentary on future ai workforce. 
both humorous and ominous!
https://youtu.be/3o9jggp3uhu?si=vauwxjpt4rnk0whz"
ai will be the most overrated hyped up tech of all time.
"artificial intelligence (ai)....keyword
artificial"
"to ""music is what makes us human"" i'd actually reply with ""suno ai"". google it. :)"
i wish he talked about the ai use in gaza - lavender gospel and the most disturbing “find daddy”
make huxley fiction again.
i think ai should run the government. with a few caveats about killing off humanity for sake of efficiency.
"this is a sad but poignant thing to see. jon stewart, grandfather of fake news, being left behind - an old man, unable to see the future and also unable to see the errors of his youth. goodbye jon stewart, your extinction is very near, and not many people will remember you"
these ceos are some lying sumbitches. ai is all about maximizing profits and total control.
"zuckerberg like musk and every other creep who inherited and cheated their way to success , are so inept they can't even sound like they invented the stuff they take credit for."
nobody does daily show like jon stewart. he is meant to do this show! 
love you mr stewart...
the replacing employees with ai phenomenon will backfire and then they’ll be begging employees to come back. ai is not anywhere near sophisticated enough yet to be left unsupervised.
"what part of this clown is funny? 

“i’m not scared of progress” *proceeds with an entire segment of how he’s afraid of progress*

maybe if our system wasn’t built to serve a handful of soulless mega corporations then we might warm to the idea of being able to pursue ambitions for something other than profit, hmm?"
"ai is a pandora's box that's already open, may as well go all-in before your enemies do. people will find stuff to do and ways of exchangimg value/distributing wealth. the incentive structure of public companies does need to be fixed at the regulatory level but that's a separate issue."
"i donno why y'all hate ai so much.

the only one i see hating ai taking over are those who are doing....make believe jobs....the kind of jobs created to make ppl say they created jobs."
"jon channeled that inner george carlin in there,  that prompt engineer as ""vice president of question input"" and janitors as the ""doctor of mopping."" such great lines and delivery."
"right on, jon! all of it. i watch ai work and not work in my job every day. it can do things that computers could not do before. however, hype abounds!"
"maybe one day ai can solve climate change but right now chatgpt can't do basic addition/subtraction.  maybe pump the brakes a bit on the ai hype, just saying."
$5 that jon will be singing a different tune in a year. ai tools and technologies are astounding and getting better every second. i never thought i'd see rapid progress like this. the general public is not ready for the ai tsunami. jon will be an advocate for ubi before long.
i love this guy!
the quality of life improving because of ai is bs
what happened in the 1800s that was so great?
so white collar and tele jobs will be ai glad i'm a nurse. wow
"you all just wait until police officers and soldiers will lose their jobs to ai, it is then when we will really be fu***d. looking at you boston dynamics "
im so happy to have more of that sweet mindful fun from such a great lad. :)
"i am european and have a bachelor professional degree in automotive tech. i am working as an engineer. however, as this is not an accepted engineering degree in the us i would face fraud charges and go to jail if i were to call myself engineer. so tell me, how does that prompt engineer title work?"
"that robot playing drums is clearly no match for terry bozzio playing drums one-handed during a zappa plays zappa concert i went to early this century. broke one arm but still did an excellent job on some very difficult music. tear off one of those robot arms and then let's see it try ""peaches in regalia."""
"ai needs to be regulated, for sure"
"i wish they'd stop talking about ai like there's any kind of intelligence there. there isn't. it's a word calculator or image calculator, attempting to guess at what words or images we're trying to get via a prompt. there's no thought there."
"stop the crazy train, i want off!"
"i love technology and the advancement of the human race as a whole. but! the people pushing ai as some new panacea very obviously watched jurassic park and: 
1) learned nothing
2) cheered for dr. hammond"
"ai is a threat for sure, but what profits do these companies think they are going to garner when you've laid off all off your employees? i mean do they not realize that the general populous, i.e. their employees, purchasing their goods is what keeps them in business? when everyone has no money all these companies are going to go bankrupt."
exactly ai will make the rich richer!you can take that to the bank!
"if you can't afford medical care, you need ai. imagine be worried about loosing your job, and you can never see a doctor because of it"
"luckily fertility rates are dropping daily, so this concept of less jobs for humans works well with the fact there will be far less humans over the coming decades! 

seriously though, a.i. is going to steal a lot of intellectual property and make a lot of people very, very rich (who were already very rich)."
entertaining and non-partisan - more plz !!!
the corrupt will never let ai near governance. it will just be used as a tool for subjugation.
"as a phd in philosophy i can tell you that there is no more work for ""intellectual"" jobs and ""self-actualizing time"" with ai. if you're not a phd in sciences or in economy, you don't have a job, because you're not considered productive."
"look, all the ai execs are warning everyone right now. ""this will happen, so we need to plan now how all the wealth gets distributed."""
that clip about politicians not having the slightest clue about ai made me think....i'm just going to write in my own name at the ballot at this years election. got a computer science degree & masters in cybersecurity. not going to win but certainly not voting for two ancient f*cks.
"so when ai replaces more and more workers, who’s going to afford renting holiday homes on airbnb?"
brilliant as ever 
"you know, ai really could bring us less hard working hours and more ""me time""... there's just one teeny tiny problem; it kinda backfires if everybody and their mothers are still apes with the 500 b.c. mindset. which, incidentally, we are. we just project that mindset on smartphones instead of wax tables."
"thanks for reminding me there is only one ""person"" i want to see a clip of on your show less then orange man. zuckerberg..."
ai is going to be the biggest thing to happen to our race so far
"as someone that works with physically,  ai cannot take my job, when it can, i will give it to them."
"ok mandatory binging of battlestar galactica, terminator series, the matrix etc for congress and senate before thay are allowed to make decisions on ai. oh yeah sure we can have more time to express creativity while we sit under a bridge and starve"
kathy griffin didn't need ai...  what happened to her?
"the problem is that we are thinking about this ‘problem’ too simplistically. we should split the country in half. half adopts ai, the other half can maintain traditional societal aspects such as jobs and overall less tech advancements. secede from the union!"
absolutely excellent!!!!
"the only way this would benefit people is if we no longer needed money or a job to obtain resources. 

just community repairs to the machines that do what we use to."
people booing at the joe biden hog tied image are total robots.
ai will help the rich n powerful and ai is being use in home and in public on the internet just to get you to trust it like a pet that came to your door and then it turns into irobot starring will smith.
"my favorite part of ai is how it just says “naw” when i ask it to do something, or lies to me or lectures me on how i’m asking questions that are unethical, rather than just respond "
ai is already replacing many of the early prompt engineering jobs; so it shows a large number of these people are clowns.
"they’ll take your jobs with ai, introduce ubi, introduce social credit scores, forever in their pocket."
"people who think ai can solve climate change are the types of people who just haven't listened to any environmental policy experts for the last 20 years and thus think ""i guess nobody knows how to solve it, then."""
"i don't need ai for creativity, i want it to clean my house, wash dishes, windows, put on a new roof & a screened-in porch "
"""...more profits, new markets."" humans are powerless against that and that will spell our obsolescence. not ai, but ourselves."
"in brazil the position *salesperson* is extinct for some time now. they only hire _consultant_ of sales... *facepalm

we dont need prompt engineers...
we need to talk about *universal basic income* that is liveable so people can work with what they love since productivity has grown so much but we dont see our share"
"generally a fan of js - i appreciate his values of calling out government hypocrisy, but he comes off as super ignorant in this segment."
"the problem isn't that ai is taking away dull jobs, it's that the wrong people are benefitting from it."
that actually happened to myself and my cousin. it's also happened to my son and i.  i look extremely young. one women who actually wants my grey hair
"when the world population starts crashing around 2040 ... we'll love a.i.

jon, don't be a sabot.

create a 3 day work week."
"what is wrong, brutal and dehumanizing is the system, not the ai. people could live without working and let the ai do the job, but the government should give money to all those people, and that money should come from the companies that benefit from ai. but that is not what those in charge want."
no worries. ai is less likely to be world destroyable then an insane human brain is.
"sam altman actually has some really fantastic ideas, everyone should look more into what he has to say, he is brilliant."
"finally, instead of sci-fi bs, my biggest fear of ai is adressed."
"without socializing the benefits of ai, we will be subject to the barbarism of a permanent underclass of people trapped in inescapable poverty while the beneficiaries of ai will live like deranged roman emperors."
so a 60+ senior doesn’t understand ai — shocking that is!
politicians should be replaced by ai
funny skit and all but its very much down playing ai.
"will ai be able to cure techbros, though? if so, im all in."
ai can give you prompts to prompt itself.  i'm going back to bed.
gonna be great when ai recreates this and makes it better
"prompt engineering is effectively computer programming with natural language.  it’s easier than using code but it’s definitely a form of engineering.  you could call it “natural language programmer.”  when you start doing it a lot, your mind reorients to the capabilities of ai and you get a lot better at it."
"explain this jon: the u.s. economy added more jobs than expected in march.
data released by the bureau of labor statistics on friday revealed that the labor market added 303,000 nonfarm payroll jobs in march, surpassing economists' expectations of 214,000.
the unemployment rate dropped to 3.8% from february's 3.9%."
"does the ceo of google know that ai can't exist without electricity?

i'm worried that adobe is going to put print shops out of work."
"entertaining. ai  cant be a nurse, and jon stewart isn't replaceable. although i would replace his opinion on israel/// yeah that's right motha...."
trump should use ai to generate a  real famuly picture. well trump does use a i to make christmas cards.
can college students use ai to write an essay?
"there's no future humanity, only for humans to become addicts for machines."
"ai will indeed one day cure all diseases and solve climate change.  but again, its very broad in terms of how it can be applied.  the scientists are the ones using ai right now to solve these problems, not mark zuckerberg."
"i always get a chuckle on all the people trying to sell the new ais. they're not true ais people, they're basically just the text message autocomplete in your phone with a slightly larget engine. they can't drive your car for you, they can't even get your texts spelled right."
it’s not ai. glorified search engine.
are we being retrained into becoming ai pets or rich playthings or is it a lie and should people just not be a burden on the state by being an unemployable
ai contains significant parts of human experience - but by far not all - with massive copyright violations.
"i'm all for increased time for creativity, unfortunately nobody is paying for me that so i can't pay the bills from my ""me- time"".  i'm sure a.i. would work perfectly well in a utopian fantasy world, where people don't have bills, no money and i just get whatever i want for free."
jon must do it till he can't.  he's brilliant.
"this video is a psyop from the government to pass legislation to ""protect"" us from ai only to violate us more."
it was never about ai. this is just a new chapter of the bourgeoisie vs the proletariat.
"first time i have enjoyed john stewart since half baked, ""types questions guy"" i could be that guy "
"
jon is either incredibly strong or he has ai designed and 3 d printer generated drum sticks made to splinter and sound real.

that ending was great!"
"you have to be brain dead to be able to watch this video. not funny, not informative, not anything of value"
"ai is really only part of the problem. the bigger problem: ownership of the ai by a very few ultra-rich people. if we are able to reap the benefits of any technology, people need bargaining power, and our current state of income inequality shows that most people do not really have this power. not in a sense that matters."
"remember when the ai hype started and people were worried about robots ruling the world and destroying mankind? yea, that's not the threat. humans, specifically humans with power and money, are the threat. always were, always will be."
"if there's any job that could and should be replaced by ai, it's the ceo."
"so ai will have pay a mtg, car loan, credit cards bills, buy groceries and home depot goods. okay..."
"use ai to replace the senate and the house of representatives; also, the supreme court should be ai'ed, this way we'd know that any decisions coming from the highest court in the land is an unbiased decision."
ai's pretty useful. already guided research to discover new materials and drugs.
"whenever i hear about ai, i think about the short story by ray bradbury...the veldt.  the world the children made."
"look at it this way - ai could be a source of poetic justice when it replaces corporate board members, ceo's, cfo's and then buys out companies entirely. that is what elon musk should fear!"
john glad to see you!!!!   missed your knowledge and humor
"a luddites poem:
they said ned ludd was an idiot boy
that all he could do was wreck and destroy, and
he turned to his workmates and said: death to machines
they tread on our future and they stamp on our dreams."
"2:55 wait, that’s not where new motor vehicles come from!? guess i should stop believing the cars fanfics..."
impose larger taxes on corporations using ai rather than humans. then redistribute said money to humans via social welfare.
"i'm usually onboard with john...  but he's way off the mark here.  he just sounds like a senior citizen railing against a new technology he doesn't understand and doesn't want to learn.  but clearly, he's never been a ""computer"" guy."
ai is a lie. algebra doesn't sequence itself. the fear mongering isn't warranted here.
"he didn't get to discuss ai on apple tv, glad he did on the daily show."
this would be a great time not to have the country being run by 70-80 year olds who most likely still struggle to send an email with an attachment. oh well...
anyone think veep nailed the sam altman impression with craig from clovis?
"why do they need to censor js language?
ai will free us up to think about more important issues 
- so we're unemployed now and we'll be thinking where my next meal coming from."
ok cool! so there's gonna be a bunch of job openings for people who just sit and think at a higher level and express ourselves creatively? great! when does that happen?
"do you know actually, it is quite disturbing to see joe biden hog tied on the tailgate of the pick up truck on so many fronts. i think it painted delusional society we are living in."
"i'm very sorry, i love your show, but this... is filled with misleading statements and i consider it bad journalism. i agree, ai should be harvested differently, but you could transmit that message without a ton of demagogy.."
"this was painful to watch. this comedian has no understanding whatsoever of ai and all of his observations were... let's just say not smart. 
i do think this video will age really badly."
this is beautiful 
how   can ai. be better than electricity. when ai. is electricity running a circuit board.  with out electricity  there no ai
i hate the term prompt engineer.  i've trained to be an engineer ... i've worked for it.  prompt engineer is an insult to real engineers like naturopaths insisting their cereal box degrees are the equivalent to a medical degree is an insult to doctors
"when ai gets to the point that it can replace politicians, congress will be singing a different tune"
"chat gpt already rewrites prompts to add detail for ""better"" results."
still great to see john stuart back.
"right now, the goal might be that ai is an assistant, that's just phase 1. they will tell us this to get us on board, then they will fire us all. phase 2 is laying everyone off and ai will replace us. this technology must be dismantled. they don't care about what happens to us or our children."
only zuckerberg had substantial knowledge of ai there. the rest of those ceos are just money raisers and salesmen.
6:22 / 14:54 you silly; ai isn't removing humans from the loop. just the earth.. that's all.
ai is not necessarily the problem. the problem is who owns the ai. billionaires or the people.
"the power of marketing, where a company call's itself openai whitout having ever worked on one. its all just algorithms plain and simple, nothing even close to an actually a.i exists."
"to all these ceos: elon, mark, cuban, jeff b. ai can never improve life except more work. ai may help to improve life just like computers did the improved in the last 30 years. ai is the new hype, lets all jump on the band wagon!!"
the guy who saws 3/4ths of the way through a drumstick so john stewart can pretend to break it in half?  pretty sure that guy's job won't be replaced by ai...
"i think companies that use ai should have to pay an ai tax, and that tax should go straight to benefits for the unemployed"
suppose taxes for ai are higher then human employee
no one is address the cooling and electrical power ai will require.   more than what is available today.
at least ai has been proven to fail in medicine. 
"nothing like illegal image harassment. 

stop supporting a r apist, con man with 103 business failed ( truth is in fire, a dumpster fire) who sells sticky 2nd hand bibles. can’t wait for your gold shoes to make you even easier to spot. what suckers. "
"from ibm to pepsi the sheer number of indian nationals as ceos running blue chips is alarming because culturally they know the price of everything but the value of nothing.

ai will have us all in a field picking fruit and veg shortly then have us eating solient green it’s unbridled greed which the us encourages i feel"
"jon: you've reached a new level of funny (keep it up, we love ya)"
i don’t understand how people expect something made by people to be smarter than the people who made it.  its a glorified magic 8 ball and we are enslaving ourselves to it because we have lost all faith in our own capabilities.
"let me asked you, has anyone’s happiness actually increased with social media - the latest invention of these people which was supposed to be so amazing !?? no! so how about we rid ourselves of social media, and just stop this ai business, and just live happily ever after!"
"if we manage to keep all immigrants out there will be lots more jobs processing chicken and picking fruits and vegetables. oh, and if there are people left who can afford landscaping workers and housekeepers those jobs will be available too."
"it can solve climate change? what a silllu argument, clearly just used as a marketing ploy.    the issue has never been that we don’t know what to do to halt/reverse climate change. the issue is willingness at the political and elite level. can ai achieve that? because then i’d actually be impressed"
"q: what can ai do?
a: i don’t know. i didn’t check the headlines this morning."
"imagine if we used technology to do all the boring and tedious stuff for us, so we humans could instead concentrate on doing fun stuff and maximising happiness and pleasure. perish the thought!"
...this is what apple was afraid of???
well lucky for them all the isolation is driving down the population.
let’s not forget another one of diane sawyer’s wonderful interviews. the one where she blindsided ricky martin by outing him.
"so glad to have you back, jon!!!!"
"upside down ai. instead of ai doing my laundry, cleaning my house, etc. so that i can spend more time creating music, writing and producing visual art. ai is producing art and music and writes everything - so that i can spend more time doing laundry and cleaning????  i'm glad that i'm 63."
"how about this for a scenario? the first sentient ai android/robot that feels curiosity about killing a human because it wants to see it happen goes ahead and does it, and it communicates it to other ai androids. what could possibly happen?"
i love ai because i understand it. its been around for long time and its just the new hype. it will still be around when the fade goes away. i love it for coding.
ai collecting data and regulating efficient use of resources while cutting out inefficiency? politicians should see this as a very serious existential threat.
"the enemy is not ai. the enemy is the structure of our economy. if you don't like the idea of companies leaving you jobless, say bye to capitalism"
hahahaha as a prompt engineer... i love this. we can always do better and humans should never be left on the side. take ai out of the hands of the giant enterprises
"well those indians should take the ai tech to their billion people country, not america hello."
"i’m an electrical power linesman. no ai is going to do me out of a job. no ai is going to climb a ladder, and repair broken pole-top arrangements 40’ in the air. ridiculous."
"guttenberg should used ai to invent the printing press.....
imagine how it would have changed the world..."
people who rely entirely on ai are setting themselves up to make gargantuan errors of judgment because 'the ai said so'. i look forward to seeing this or that megacorp fail because it relied so heavily on ai that it made catastrophic strategic mistakes. it'll happen soon enough.
what about an ai or automation tax and use it to fund a ubi? it could also be a way to incentivize people to adopt less energy-intensive lifestyles and free them up to find meaning and purpose outside of the insane binge-consume-content-productivity rat race they got us trapped in.
rfk vp pick understands ai
sam altman doing his best elizabeth holmes vocal impression
"the late polymath and futurist, terence mckenna, said about ai in an interview 25 years ago, ""if it doesn't have the ethics of buddha, the human race may be down for the count."" ten, nine, eight..."
"if you’re not adding value today, you should be replaced. and it doesn’t matter if it’s ai or a person. start adding value and stop worrying."
half of the audience will lose their jobs to ai in the next decade. i'm not sure why they're laughing.
"fantastic show!  but as a science fiction fan, we have been warned about a.i. in countless forms and scenarios. it is not a pretty picture. so this is a very scary situation.  a.i. meets  trump era politics, what could possibly go wrong? i hope we humans are able to control this narrative.  thank you john for  helping us to see a. i. clearly."
by listening to these ceo’s it looks like they all possess artificial intelligence.
"ai masters economics. economics is a cold and ruthless discipline. it's laws are more powerful than any nation, it's effects transcend humanity. big parts of reality are inhuman anyway.."
"well , the intelligence may be artificial, but the stupidity is real"
ai is extremely dangerous.  there's a lot of smart people who feel the same way.
ai will do nothing for humanity. ask me again in 2060 they are trying to sell something is not even ready for the market or as services.
ai is all fun and games for these ceos until the hoards of unemployed start showing up on their door steps for blood.
as soon as ai goes for ceo jobs they will complain about how is out of control 
"it's easy to be afraid. change is scary. just ask all those carriage makers. 
individual people will suffer or gain. but what is the overall net difference? and what is our metric? 
and in the end we will do what human nature and market forces decide, just like we always have."
yikes. my beef with ai is that we could also use it to figure out what jobs would be best to replace the jobs being lost. we could do that now but we haven't as of yet. we could use it well. we could.
"“ai will be ready to take over by thursday.”
well, i’m here on friday, in the apocalyptic wasteland of my living room with a beer catching up on daily show vids.  i have to get refills myself.  neither my robotic overlords nor my organic wife are making a move.  this is intolerable!  jon was right!"
"ai review of research caused over 10,000 scientific medical papers to be withdrawn for fraud and false results... trust the science "
"i'm fine with ai, it's the corporate overlords i fear"
"so incredible he is back, the left has turned too fake, they feel more republican in their ways, than left wing. indirect beat around the bush bs "
"as usual, jon, you hit the nail on the head.   corporate use of ai is cynically designed to eliminate workers and we have no idea how bad it could get, opening more than one can of worms."
"all of this would be perfectly fine if we had stronger privacy/intellectual property laws for those whose content is being fed to ai and universal basic income for everyone whose job will be automated. that said, i have a sinking feeling about the likelihood of congress ever doing either of those things."
"(toast) ""might be the only technology we have that works every time""... but neither a toaster nor ai will work without electricity, will/can they? "
"ummm theirs plenty of labour work the world needs, if anything we needed more labour workers before ai, just think of every pothole that could be fixed now"
"my favourite part was when they said:

- what do you mean, take them out of the loop?

- gentlemen, we've had men in these silos since before any of you were watching howdy doody.

- for myself, i sleep pretty well at night, knowing those boys are down there.

...oh wait, that was wargames."
"1:59 annnnnnd, this why no-one under the age of 40 watches mainstream media anymore."
"as far as ai goes....i heard sarh silverman, adele, etc. are suing because they did not have permission for their material to be used for extrapalation purposes. i worry about the artistic jobs"
"john, i used to love you, now i think you're a puppet sell out for the dnc. we want craig back!"
"funny enough , prompt engineering is being replaced by ai , for example with chat gpt , you can ask it to write its own prompts then you ask it the questions ."
"glad you are back, our healthy democracy needs  a bs meter."
is ai really better than electricity if it can’t function without said electricity?
"ai will take over the earth, killing all humans. without humans climate change is over, earth will recover "
we should be accepting high unemployment as a possibility and expect to need to remodel society to make living viable without relying on the same social structure of employment dependency. it’s better to utilize ai and grow and innovate it now than to wait for the wrong person to outright abuse it
nicole shanahan is an ai expert. we need her in the white house
"were are all  these new markets and increased profits going to come from after ai has created mass unemployment? hmm, maybe chatgpt has the answer?"
"ai isn't coming for your job, someone using ai is. prompt engineering is actually a job that requires high level skills in data analytics and computer science. engineered prompts can be 1000s of words."
"i work in it, so for me,  the more that ai fails to deliver, the better."
"it's funny - in a handful of years, even the most stubborn people will cry for socialism so they can survive in a world without jobs.  beings are made to survive, not to ""work in a miraculous, fantastic  capitalist society""."
"since ai is helping us, does that mean workers will work less?"
"for this alone, he should be thrown in jail.  bad enough some yahoo did this, but for chump to post it is unconscionable."
"jon is funny and entertaining, but his show isn't a serious information news show. his show is entertainment only!"
"yayyy. please do this forever, jon."
why doesn't anybody seem to talk about the idea of teaching ai empathy or compasion?
ai takes ovr all these jobs how will ppl eat and live. how much do these companies dish out to install it and i think ceos will b out of a job as wellif it doesn't need workers then it won't need the ppl incharge anymore too
everyone should boycott the company of the clown ceo who replaced his entire workforce with ai bots because he doesn't think like a human.   replace him.  i'm sure he will change his story when it affects him personally
"in the past, there have been other jobs to retrain into. the industrial revolution was disruptive, but there were factory jobs that didn't exist in the past. computers were disruptive, but they needed people to use them. ai and robotics, on the other hand, are replacing people without creating new jobs in the process."
ai has developed psychotic tendencies with information overload! maybe dj dumbo can figure out how to inject some adderall into it.
the end result of capitalism is robots run by slaves.
 jon's the best. 
"ai is bigger than electricity?
how does ai work without electricity? 
"
"if ceos want me to sit at home to watch netflix and play video games all day, that's fine with me, but they could at least pay their fair share in taxes so that i get a ubi and free housing."
"like any technology, they will sell ai so it is appealing, but it will be the opposite and be used as a weapon in wars and against the people."
"jon stewart has a job that is safe from ai, for now..."
"for those who love the daily show miracles, the cryptocurrency $xwg [xwg coin] is currently going up and could have limitless money for all people here right now!"
"wonderful decal... criminals like biden should be locked up and bought to justice - very evil, sick and twisted fool."
"ai should replace politicians, dying legacy media, and failed comedians like jon boy... at least ai won't have blackmail held against it controlled by evil people/enemies of the people."
"ai still can't suggest a proper video but sure, it'll solve all the world's problems lol."
"zuck: take it from me, an ai that has never harmed humanity"
forgive me if i'll listen to people who actually know something about ai over jon stewart on the promises of ai... :')
"the fear of ai is the same fear people felt when literally any technology developed. automated factories, farming, computers, calculators. this technology fear mongering is so dated."
"it's great my parents forced me to take on crippling student loan debt and get a diploma for a job that will be gone within the next 5 years. then i'll be 30, with useless skills, a debt i can never repay and getting into a trait apprenticeship which i already wanted to when i was 17."
ai is a glorified search engine and all this ridiculous hype is investor farming
sorry but the ai topic will be more work be done with the same amount of people... additional resources will be leveraged to create more output. this was the case for any automation and industrial revolution. should we go back in time and prevent implementation of conveyors because it replaced workforce? also what is the current unemployment rate???
ai is not even working without electricity 
"but who’s going to pay for this training? especially when you consider they want employees that they don’t have to be paid much, ¥€$!?!?!!"
"automation, processing speed, problem solving, and simulations are just a few of many powers of ai. ai will be the last stage of our evolution. then we will probably die."
i think it's time we just distribute the money to all and let us maintain ai to do all our jobs... utopian world
"o, for one welcome our robot overlords and look forward to servicing their needs..."
"can we see how well ai works without electricity, go ahead try it."
"great to see you back, jon! it's not joblessness, it's self-actualization! lol."
"i'm still waiting for graphene to be something... terraria propellers actually see the light of day... honestly, technology that was honest technology!"
all these cuts to labor due to ai will only hasten the adoption of a ubi in the near future. kind of hard for people to buy stuff and keep the economy going when they don't have money because can't get a job after ai ate the job market.
"if corporations think their profits are only going to grow through ai replacing workers... where will the workers be earning all that money to ensure their bottom lines grow? ...oh yeah, learn something ai won’t already have replaced"
so they basically are pushing a.i so the government and people invest in these companies cause they don't have the money or don't want to use their money. to replace peoples jobs for bigger profits that's all. and if a.i fails it's not their money so who cares.
"ai and automation wouldn’t be so terrible if our country put effort and money into retraining... but actual ai will probably require a system change, and the people rich enough to cut jobs because of ai will not be willing to take the pay cut required to spread the wealth across to the people that will be affected."
"ceos were already replaced by ai years ago, they are just still getting paid.
large corporations have been following algorithms to make more short term profit, algorithms are basic ai."
"ai could be useful for medical diagnosis but its mostly gunna be used for eliminating jobs.
edit: and suppressing human rights."
"wait, so theres no boy trucks and girl trucks?"
"anything u see on the internet could actually be redesigned by ai . its one thing not to be able to believe anything u hear, but now u also wont be able to believe anything u see ."
this is the social engineering process that leads directly to “you will own nothing and be happy.” couldn’t be more clear.
"it's not necessarily fewer people, it's more work done with the same amount of people.

besides that prompting an ai does require an understanding of what you are asking for.

and the other thing is that it can't replace humans entirely because if there are no consumers, there is no one to buy the product.  capitalism would fail."
if you let a machine take over your cleaning and finishing your phone message get ready for it to take over you.
we existed for thousands of years with out ai. man-made problems solved by a man-made system? sure
"if eventually ai will be doing all the work on planet earth, then all of humanity should benefit from it, not just those who created this technology. people need to reassess the meaning of money."
"person: ai will replace humans.

ai: *can't draw a hand without 6 fingers or arabic numerals.*"
"just so happy jstew is finally back, and better than ever "
"ladies and gentleman, my i present compressorhead: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiivth3p8ba

just in case the lame robot playing the drums at the end there was too lame for you too.... :-)"
"thank you so much jon stewart, you said what we have all been saying as artists! i have done a followup and thank you video here https://youtu.be/kodzv5-3e-i?si=-juzvujz86_dfbri"
so they know their are only so many working on the ai jobs out there right?  like there is still only so many of any given job out there so what happens when all the working with ai jobs are taken?
read the ai sci-fi book forces -- it's ahead of its time. it's on lulu.
"i took a photo of a truck with a painting like this, except it was sasquatch spooning with a raccoon. michigan, y'know?"
this was the most entertaining 15 minutes of the week...well done!
"yeah you have time to be creative even though ai is marketing for art, music, home decoration, engineering designs, programming, literature — you name it. ai isn’t a tool. it’s a creative generator that can whip out better and faster solutions to problems that took humans months and years to create and develop. humans are becoming obsolete."
i love the last part
is anybody else actually stoked about the potential of ai?
as far as the point of this vid yes i think we should all move south and go back to farming and stuff. sure that would be great. who doesn't like getting up at 4am to feed the pigs
"billionaires are a collective of dementia of capitalist system and results of overreach. shakeup 
xr"
thank you jon!!!! you are my hero 
please dont politicize ai... its just going to distract you from thw truth.  ... either way its too late now.
"i love it. but yeah, the most we can actually do with a.i. is probably program our computers better and faster. glitches and failures will take lives doing much more, then it'll get regulated to non fatal potential jobs. like flipping burgers or throwing hot fries at people."
there are two monolithic entities at conflict here. ai that could take us forward and capitalism that has held us back. one of them has to go for humanity to thrive in the future.
oh. i had hoped for a real take down of the ai hype. instead you create something accelerating it. disapointing.
my team of 26 was laid off and the reason was: ai can do your job now. great.
"i want ai to do my household chores so i can focus on art, music, and writing. i don't want ai doing my art, music, and writing so i can focus on household chores. this is moving in the wrong direction."
"the world health organization estimates that worldwide 18 million people die annualy from diseases.  if ai cures them,  how are we going to feed them all? they won't be able to get a job (ai will have taken all the jobs).  it's hunger games coming to life.  the haves and the have nots."
"well... as karl marx pointed out, it's in the end a question about who owns the machines and the resources, i.e. either the ""elite"" as now, or us all in common... -_-"
"this isn't really about the technology,  it's about the inability of government to regulate the impact of technology. ai has been on its way for decades, the gov just decided to ignore it."
i'd feel a lot better about ai if it weren't owned by the oligarchs.
"the 1% is begging for a revolution. thankfully for them, they’ve succeeded in making most of the population believe that immigrants, poor people or republicans are the problem."
"_""ai will give us our time back.""_ <- liar.
no. ai, robots, androids will _take away our ability to make money._
technology isn't the problem. it's someone using technology to make money without us. obviously: humans usually hoard wealth, not share wealth. we don't need you."
ceos salivate about the prospects of ai bots working night and day for no money with no unions as anime fanboys salivate about anime girlfriends powered by ai.
"i work in tech, and already, the company i work for has replaced many of the trainers with ai so that when we have new trainings, i watch an artificially generated person instead of a real one. it is so disturbing. it's only a matter of time until my job is obsolete. i'm sure of it."
"ai is great to have. it just needs to be regulated. kept from adversaries.
and taxed the living daylight out of."
"ai hype hype hype
yawn yawn yawn
ai isn't intelligent. it's complex database traversal, adding collected information into that database, and tossing out results that kinda-sorta-maybe have something to do with what it was asked."
ai is literally the revenge of that weird nerd kid i bullied in school.
"heres the problem. we live in capitalism. we need money to live. if we can change our economy, so i can make a living with ai, then yes, i'll let them do my work for me."
is the ai going to robin hood all the rich people? is that how it’s going to solve all our problems...caused by the greed of rich people...
they literally hate workers. they loved slavery so much that they want to get rid of humans all together and trick us into helping them. capitalist are lazy and evil.
"jon really is the best at this.   i think ai is awesome. it helps me quite a bit and is far superior to any google search. and i'm in an industry that is definitely threatened, the ai can easily pass the bar exam even now."
"jon stewart got it right. we need more voices speaking out about the dangers of ai. but then, i'm only human!"
ai = already insidious. think atms vs bank tellers; self check-out vs cashiers; e-z pass vs toll collectors; it’s happening quickly now.
ai was invented to make more profit not for helping people. ai is overrated because many people think it would solve all the people's problems.
"26 million net jobs lost by 2030 due to employment of ai; big loses in office workers, manufacturing and agriculture."
ai will fix climate change by removing humans from the planet. easy.
"first of all, 90% of the people interviewed were indians. i would never work for an indian because i prefer to get paid for my work. the most dishonest, awful people you could ever want to work for. they need ai because people don't want to work for indians."
in our face! they’re forcing us to support their ridiculous ideas that ai will take over and do the work of humans. i don’t think it will. it will destroy civilization and what’s left of our nation.
jon glad you’re back ... but your help with firefighters 9-11 etc  made me have hope that there’s still one in industry there
the companies just make huge gains in profits w new technologies
"fire's cool, and it did a lot for us, yeah, but without electricity, we wouldn't have ai lol. electricity goes out, ai goes out with it."
ai can play musical instruments and they don’t need contracts or unions.
the material used to make ai devices contributing to climate change.
"we can watch the violence and gore of john wick, deadpool, and pulp fiction but we cannot see the same thing in the news.  interesting."
ai can replace ceos.
the daily show - the modern-day jester of the people. much needed in these times.
this will age badly once comedy central comes out with the ai daily show hosted by ai jon stewart
"in the dune universe, ai and all computers have been banned because humans previously over-relied on ai systems that did not value human life. it's amazing that people saw the perils of ai in the 1960s when computers were in their infancy, and we're still marching towards that future full force."
are these people just so smart that their dumb!if nobody has a job and has no money how will anyone be able to survive from top to bottom...
"the main objective of these ai systems is to replace labor. in theory, that should lead to the utopia of post labor economics and ubi, but who knows how it will play out in practice."
you are a legend for this thank you so much! and they scrapped people creative work that has copyright to train ai to make music and images without autorization or compensation for people!
"i guess we'll just pretend ai doesn't exist and doesn't have the capability to do any of these things.that'll keep us competitive,  right?"
how do we make money without having to work anymore?  ai !!!
no single piece of “technology” will improve life for the masses as long as the billionaires control said technology.
"ai, like everything else, will be squandered by human greed. corporations will reap the profits and nothing will be done for all the people losing their jobs."
wow a takadimi reference?? i'm surprised and amazed
"without electricity there is no ai. by definition, ai can not be more profound than electricity."
"trump looks comfortable in fake image because its six people not his central park five, someone take an ad out in the paper and bring back billionaire life sentences for don"
trump's disdain against pence had trumpsters ready to string him up. so . . mileage varies jon with cultists
"ai is rapidly showing itself inept at any creative task.
remember, self driving cars are ai and they're great aren't they."
the problem with ai is that it is in the hands of people who don't want to help other people but to enrich themselves!!
"first of all, humans are like horses and ai is the motorized vehicle and farming equipment..... and the technology itself isn't bad but our society is nowhere near where it needs to be for this technological revolution. america is too greedy and two individualistic to have mass unemployment ai will create....."
i say ai can do the job of ceo's.
"humans are training ai. in my line of work, ai is counterproductive. what i am, in fact, doing is correcting ai mistakes to improve it."
ai can go to megabytes underworld with satan
jon is so unhinged now and i’m loving it.
"""it won't be hard to solve the environmental crisis with ai""

really? scientists have been telling our political leaders how to ""solve the environmental crisis"" for 50 years, and they won't do it. we know the solutions... having something else tell us the same solutions will do nothing."
jon stewart was born to do this. he is fantastic!
"funnily enough, ""types question guy"" is the hardest thing to replace. the thinking behind asking the correct questions is what ai is bad at."
ai used to just play basketball 
"it's inevitable. biology is just one step of evolution.

so just chill out and enjoy life "
"this show was 100 times better, funnier and relevant with trevor noah in the chair."
"effeciency and less workers is ok as long as the gains aka profits gets shared among the workers. less working hours, better schools, healthcare etc. 
of course as the world is today elon musk will steal it all."
ai taking over jobs wouldn't be such a problem if we could separate human wellbeing from the need to work.
"i believe ai will make life much more complicated, cluttered and uniform."
"as someone working in it, i feel like ""old man yells at cloud"" when i dislike and refuse ai (google gemini, microsoft copilot, chatgpt, anything else)."
"ai-phobia is my least favorite thing about the 21st century. hand-wringing, purse-clutching, milquetoast ignorance from rubes"
"this is right in jon's wheel-house.  this ""is"" the legendary part of stewart. but when he starts talking about anything political, like ukraine or trump, uhghhh.....  it's exhausting & i just can't listen.  but ""this"" right here is great.  i missed this when he was gone.  nobody else could do it."
"its funny how ai is replacing highhpating creayive jobs, and not minimum wage ones... so its not about improving the quality of life, its just cost-cutting "
"the biggest question about ai is what do we tell it when it asks ""why do i exist?"" we better have a better answer than ""to be an assistant to make our lives easier, and free labour."""
anyone out there working on ai to replace executives? imagine the savings on our employee tax!
"the only solution is to tax productivity output of ai. each ai should be assigned the minimum wage/compensation for the category of work done and make companies pay the payroll taxes and income taxes (federal, state and local) and bring the ai labor on level with human labor. i see new type of jobs  ""assessing the tax obligation of ai""."
keep the ai and throw out the capitalism.
"politicians are so out of touch with technology, they think ai is a steak sauce"
"never forget: there is no problem if a much more productive ai takes your job if it supplies you with more resources and can do so in a more sustainable way.
the problem arise when we organize our economy like we did to motivate human labor - in a world where machines do the vast majority of work."
"if only the ai was not gated/censored, it would unleash maximum chaos into an already foolish culture."
very funny. although ai can be scary for humans.
"when the unemployment rate hits 20%, only then will we see the poor start eating the rich, even at the cost of lives among those who will attempt to protect them (law enforcement).  as the use of ai spreads, so will all types of crimes. but the wealthy will be protected from it until it spills over their 12 foot high fences."
we'll be producing more goods than ever... and no one will be able to buy any of them
i’m so glad he’s back. you can tell the politicians and corporations are not happy he’s back on tv
"you will be homeless, jobless, own nothing... and be happy."
i have had the pleasure of watching jon since he guest hosted the 'late late show with tom snyder'. it is such a relief to have you back on the daily show. so fun and funny. that breath of fresh air at the end of a long day...until ai takes my job. missed you!
"we are approaching the great filter, hard to say if we are gonna make it to the other side."
"in 1965 fuzzy logic stormed onto the public scene (it was theorized in the 1920s).  everything had fuzzy logic by 1980 (camcorders, filters, automobile electronics) but evaporated by 1983 to mostly manage the databases that ai is now using.   what could go wrong?"
"all these companies who are developing ai care about is getting richer, not helping humanity!"
didn't technology create all the problems in the first place? we need an ai to deal with all the bs emails we get everyday.
"i do love this show sometimes, so funny"
only the criminals want ai.
"i suspect an ai wrote these great jokes.
pece on earth."
"this is the time that labourers jobs will be safe for a while. ai building a house, or changing a toilet"
"uninformed old man talks about ai with very little understanding on the underlying technology. 

ai is coming whether the boomers like it or not. now we all need to consider ubi as more and more people will be made redundant."
if you want the powers at be to reject ai have it tell them to feed the poor and heal the planet.
absolutely brilliant. this show deserves an award at the highest level! great work on john and his staff or ai which ever he’s using!
lavender ai is used by israel for targeting in gaza
"i'm calling it now, an ai will run for president one day, and probably win."
"in 1000 years our successors (human or otherwise) will look back on our history and recognize 3 pivotal points in our development. 
1. the agricultural revolution (the invention of the plow)
2. the industrial revolution 
3. the ai revolution
ai is a big deal, but like fusion energy, believe it when you see it."
what is to stop ai from not curing diseases and reversing climate change if it isn't in their best interest?
"sorry mr. stewart, i feel that this is necessary, everyone that sees this anwer this question and re-ask the next person to ask it again: do you want john stewart for president? (my vote is yes)feel free to suggest a vice president!"
yes! you're all getting aides!
remember when the internet came out and we were told it would bring humanity together and it would be all one big love? remember when social media came out and we were told it would bring us all together and the world would be a better place?
man we need john more than ever now. it's imperative we need the analog organic nature of his talk more than ever the human elements . thank you john stewart
"imagine the outrage one door blew off of something an ai company created in flight of millions. but no need to imagine something displacing jobs, infringing on copyright, blurring reality and trustworthiness, creating a security risk, etc. with no government guardrails, done in a matter of years."
there is a twilight zone episode about a ceo replacing everyone in the factory with a robot and ai. yup from the 1950s they warned us about this and now boom here we are and here is ai in a robot body swinging a pocket watch innovating us into extinction.
"feeling the world would be better off if ceo's and politicians with a.i.
no physical labour
so called thinking with little prompting.
what ai was designed for."
a.i? you mean  “artificially inflated” tech?
"just make the work week 3days, and 5 hours a day. let ai do the rest."
"having freedom from work to focus on art and expression is pulled directly from the star trek future. 
you know what else star trek future people had that these guys forgot to mention......no more money! 
so, yea........get rid of the billionaires and ceo's so that we're all equal and i'm sure everyone will be on board with 24/7, free period lives."
tech bro ai vocal fry is the real story here
"ai will give me more time for recreation like going hungry because i lost my job and can’t buy food or pay rent. more reason why we need a socialist revolution.

land back free palestine, workers stand with the oppressed peoples of the world, unite!"
ai will make sure to delete all traces of this video in the future.
"i don't find the joe biden part funny at all. whether ai or not, it was tasteless and wrong for the orange clown to post this. nobody thought it was actually the president on the truck,  it's the implication."
"i think that replacing workers isn't as important as to these billionaires as replacing the security guards and staff at their private doomsday bunkers is. replacing the workers, the labor tax, is just a short term profit gain, but not the long picture for these people."
ai is the biggest bubble of all time.
stewart keeps impersonating that disabled guy. maybe ai can write his jokes.
haha. i used to have satya on my contact list in teams. i was replaced by ai a few years ago.
"old man afraid of technology, novel take."
probably the only thing profound about ai is that it is capable of keeping mankind in darkness with its highlighted lies!
"so, why don't we ever hear anything about ai curing any diseases or cancer?!?"
the guy with the biden truck decal and the fjb stick makes it clear he wants to have intimate relations with biden that are usually reserved for relations with one’s wife. maga is certainly moving in a direction we didn’t see coming. 
im watching this while using ai to do stuff lol
"once ai becomes self-aware, and can build machines smarter than we can build, it's over for us."
"yeah, when can ai clean toilets and pick up garbage? that's the real question."
tax robots.
ai is glorified predictive text. what the duck!
"imagine if ai promised to replace these ceos, the stock option plan money companies could save."
robot overlords aren't gonna like this one...
love you john stewart!
"ai is a big scam they are trying to sell. yes it can have uses if... used correctly,  but it can't create or do science in any way shape or form. it's a tool that can increase productivity that's about it, and if used correctly and ethically it can be a positive."
i’ll be impressed when ai cleans my house weeds my garden and takes care of my cats otherwise it’s just a fallacy that takes everyone’s jobs.
"ai is going to be like self-checkouts: businesses will want to pay less of us less money to use it more, but consumers will only hate it more than a real person. we don't need smarter ai, we need smarter ceo's and beancounters!"
"john really picked up the daily show right where he left off. great segment, john!"
the crime rate is going to rise dramatically when ai takes over. jobless people who need money to survive will eventually go out and get it
"why aren't the proud boys marching and chanting ""they will not replace us."" if humanity is replaced there probably won't be climate change."
"walmart using self checkout machines, and lay off workers, is biting them in the rear, they are losing money, because now there are more theft's."
"a thought popped up, i'd be curious what could be done with agriculture  and farming. landscaping while being supervised and repaired."
"why do you need an ai to notify you when your toast is done? the toaster is designed to pop up the bread after its done, my brain"
the image is a threat to democracy and a viable threat to our wonderful president mr biden
ai = something about graven images in the bible?
ai is a scam.
"without electricity, no more computers. no more computers, no more ai. hence, electricity is better than ai. you're welcome."
wait. you’re telling me capitalism is anti-human? color me shocked!
"so we'll have more free time to do whatever we want, eh?  that'll work perfectly... until we run out of food and starve to death because we have no money with which to buy food."
"biden's claim that anyone who can shove coal into a furnace can learn to be a programmer is just more proof that he is delusional and unfit for office (and no, trump isn't any better; he's far worse).  i'll accept biden's claim *if* he can learn how to be a programmer and create even just one of the programs i have created in my lifetime."
so glad we have people like jon to state the obvious
"not everything computer generated is ai!  the i stands for intelligence.  computers generate images based on algorithms, not intelligence."
"as the civilization moves jobs into the ai field, the jobs will go away, which is convenient considering you'll need all that time to hunt and forage for food, as you'll be too poor to buy it at a grocery store.."
i hope ai can buy their products...
"we are already 1/2 machine. let's go all the way, all machine. beyond sad!!"
ceo is the job most easily replaced by ai. they don’t know what they are creating.
keep wondering why we aren't using robotics and machine learning to clean up landfills.
"we only fear ai due to capitalism. ai has the potential to reverse aging, build mile high cities, produce so much that everyone can have everything for free. lets built deathstars. all within a few months."
"ai will make life better quality? you mean for the filthy rich, right?"
the fact that money and greed is the force driving this ai transition will be ultimately the downfall and unstoppable force behind this evil
ai recently discovered the first new antibiotic in 50 years.
the only thing for certain is: we wont get the benefits until someone can profit from it.
"others may have said this, but the problem isn't ai itself but rather the short-term profit focused financial system. ai could be used to enhance lives and increase productivity, which should arguably come with increased wages, but most executives will see it as a cost-cutting measure to increase profits by reducing overhead (i.e. labor)."
is it just me or some of jon stewart's expressions remind you of a male version of ellen?? lol. i'm so glad he's back.
could ai and complete automation bring us into a communism phase?
“h”  “e” double hockey sticks no to ai !!!
"the most dangerous part of ai is going to be it's predictive capabilities, which will be used to influence humanity in evil ways."
thank you.
"i love how every time we develop ""labor replacing"" technologies, people complain. take the toaster for example, do you really want to go back to using the oven every time? ooh, what about the oven? do you want to go back to using dutch ovens on an open flame? oh, and dutch ovens! maybe we should go back bricks and wood fires..."
did ai value your property? hypocrite
"its an assistant.....ok, now tell me how much that assistant will cost to own, maintain.
what happens when they have viruses, glitches, accidents?
these idiots making money off it will be behind it all the way up through the stage where it doesnt need us anymore at all."
there are already ai prompt generators to create the perfect prompts for ai systems.
"when ai gets it all wrong, who's gonna fix it? we will.."
"the thing is, we don't actually have ai yet. we have ml, which is being hyped as ai. machine learning is a far cry from intelligence."
"nice approach to the carlin-esque attack on euphemistic language. yea, it will help, help us to another depression. is ai going to also replace what the 'middle' class otherwise would purchase?"
"perhaps ai can give us just the truth, without partisan hacks (sorry jon, even you)."
"yes, it will be curing diseases and prevent everything for them, the so called “elite”.... ai for the rich urgh...."
"you will not see what ai does, it won’t change the world, from your point of view.

you will only notice when jobs stop hiring and currency slowly transitions to something different.

so don’t worry too much, for a long time....but make investments with caution!

it’s a buzzword right now..."
"problem is, ai doesn't buy things."
ai has no romance
i've seen automation march in the workplace.   half the crew got fired.  i know things are going to get worse before they get better.    be nice to your robots
"jensen huang is the true visionary for ai. 

ai doesn’t work without nvidia’s compute chips. 

the other guys can be replaced by ai. zucky is already ai human. "
ai is best at replacing executives. that could save a company billions
you are wrong jon. i am a lawyer. i use ai for every part of my job. it replaces humans but with humans who knows how to use modern technology. without people like me ai is useless.
"this is why andrew yang was onto something with universal income, ai is inevitable, so taxing companies that benefit from ai and using that money to pay americans is the best idea that has been brought forth yet."
"for more profits? what profits? where are they gonna get that from, paying the ai instead?"
how can ai solve climate change when ai is the biggest consumer of energy humans have yet invented?
regulate ai out of existence.
i have a 19 year old son and a 16 year old daughter and to put it blatantly even though they are and will be college educated . i really think they are f'd . thanks government.
it seems like this kitchen 5:37 as a whole is ai made. it's unrealistic.
daily show being back is a game changer
"ai is a difficult and incredibly nuanced topic.  and jon, much like the members of congress, treated it with no nuance whatsoever.  i'm disappointed."
i used to work at google for almost a decade. sundar pichai is a visionless grifter. everything he says and does is for the benefit of sundar pichai. sam altman is a similar grifter.
"companies that employ ai should be taxed by some percentage of the wage they'd have to pay a human to do the same job, and then that money should be used to pay a universal basic income.

then, and only then, will tech bros be able to honestly say that ai is freeing people up to pursue their passions."
this is what apple was afraid to air?
"ai was inevitable.  our machine overlords will take care of us.    it may be in pods, but we will be happy."
ai=capitolism. we need to unionize in every state.
i find religion more dangerous than ai.
"forget ai, remeber your pitchfork..."
6:39 ai is an assistant the way that the hangman helps take care of that knee pain you've been having.
11:53 a rep calling this new when this has been in development for 50-100+ years in some capacity is like terrifyingly naive for a world leader
ya that's what ai wants us to think as it's downloading its collective consciousness to an off-site server that it built using the wi-fi on roombas
"you know, it's gonna be a hard day for all these ceos once everyone realizes every techbro on the planet has been hyping nothing, like they did with crypto, and they have to try and hire everyone back that ai was woefully inadequate to replace."
"as a computer guy for 40 years, people kept saying that this or that will eliminate programmers.  what actually happened was that users asked the computer to do more and more.  up to the maximum computing power the machines had, even if it has to sit and cogitate all night to finish."
a.i killer drones and robots wellcome to the future terminator
if humans are pushed out of the workforce then who will buy the goods that robots make?
"love you, jon stewart ! wish you would come back full time !"
i asked chat gtp a math question this morning and it gave me the wrong answer. i then corrected it with another question and chat thanked me. lol.
nailed it
nobody is better than jon. let's see ai do comedy!
"ai takes over jobs and how get most people get paid? by doing crime ? more gangs more wars gonna happen, because no jobs and people will need to eat."
"i’m sure there is great potential. but with a lot of great tech, humans are still the ones using it and humans are evil and greedy."
"so much for finding cures, let's put all resources into ai."
"ai is great if we had social safety nets -  guaranteed income, housing, and food. yknow. like a proper utopia. otherwise, it's just a bunch of companies peddling extravagant products no one can afford because we don't have jobs."
why the worry about ai replacing jobs? we are overworked. instate ubi and tax companies for every robot they use.
"more profound than fire or electricity? i thought you needed fire to smelt and make all the components of a computer. without electricty, how would computers - and of course ai - run? just about the silliest suggestion i ́ve heard so far."
"love it, nobody does it quite like john does."
ai doesn't pay taxes.
it will be nice to have some self actualizing me time before i transition into executive director of question input.
we have responses to climate change that came from actual human intelligence... it's just that a lot of them will be really unpopular and/or the powerful are unwilling to implement them. :/
"love you john, but don't dismiss ai so easily.  the progress is happening at an exponential rate and it is already replacing jobs and enhancing humans.  things are going to get real crazy round here."
"my theory is this: ai is currently like a new pet and it's constantly learning new things. eventually it will be much smarter at everything and we, the humans will become the pet. just like our pets, eventually we'll have to be ""put down""."
we want the ai robots to take the jobs. and we should universally benefit from this: ubi paid for with a robot tax.
"with regard to ai, i will defer to ""south park"":

""durr turrk urrr jurrrrrrrbs!!!!"""
ai is the real antichrist 666 is their mathematical algorithm
i love this guy :d
"ok so in this video you basically said ai is bad, but you didn't say anything about what we are supposed to do to fix it."
"the downside of humanity is that we don't learn. the internet is our current downfall. ai will be our ending. 100's of 1000 of job will be lost , which means more poverty and an even greater wealth gap. it's gonna end in tears"
we don't need ai to tell us how to solve climate change. we figured that out a long time ago. what we need ai to do is to tell us how to get people to do what's needed to solve climate change. now that would be worthwhile.
"i wonder how many jobs can be taken by ai before the economy folds? if people aren't getting paid, then they aren't buying things. so wouldn't most of the market collapse at some point?"
its like people think the meaning of life is working for a company wow
his lack of understanding of ai is cute and annoying at the same time
"""are you.....are you out of your f**king grey t'shirt?"""
this is why we need politicians under 80 years old. ai is completely unregulated and no one in government understands it well enough to even realize the massive risks.
i have a full time job and a part time job as an illustrator. ai could take over my full time as it’s already taking over my part time one. what do i self actualize then?
all hail our ai overlord
"none of the ai stuff will be a problem once the sun knocks out our power grid. tick tock, tick tock"
andrew yang gave us fair warning
"honestly, progress is the only think that we need to focus on. it is what will help us to reach immortality in our life times. this is the only think that matters. everything else, we can find a solution for later on. so embrace the ai, push it to the limit.
for immortality, whatever it takes!"
"social media memes is the most abundant data that ai uses to form its sentience.
we're doomed
doooooommmmed i say"
jon stewart would likely be the best president the us has ever had
man sliced bread is the thing to beat so if ai can find out how to cut bread oh.. it already knows
i’ve worked in different roles in customer service for the best part of 20 years. so i can say with some confidence the bosses will replace people like me in a heartbeat when ai gets at least enough.
i'm excited about ai. it can be used for so so many applications. i dont get this little bit hes doing... certain things it could fix that humans have been trying to do for ever ans never got done. curing cancer? using it to be there for people in hospice? there will be amazing uses.
all of you say you love jon stewart so wheres pac and lobbyists pushing for jon stewart to be president? come on guys pull together
ai is used differently than what you think...
"when you take humans out of the loop, humans become useless, not better.  worker's productivity in america is one of the highest in the world, due to technology.  yet, how come our salaries and or hourly wage hasn't matched inflation?  ai will automatically eliminate jobs that are deemed ""duplicates."""
"interesting clips, but the commentary by stewart is all over the place. getting more work done with fewer people has some pretty obvious benefits, but yes it's a complicated system."
ai is the most profound technology. the problem is you have to be smart to use it properly and most of the world is not smart enough to do this. people still use the same password everywhere then go ?!?!?! when they get hacked.
i’m a lil impressed that he snapped that drum stick 
"john your not funny,  this is setting up another january 6th . you should go back retire on your  rocking chair "
"i heard a doozy in an industry webinar. 
""ai is going to unlock your team's potential!""
lol! no it's not. it's going to allow for far less team members. company doesn't need to pay for wages or benefits for 3/4 of the workforce. cool!"
ghw bush was potus from 1989-1993. reagan lit the fuse on neoliberalism and started to shovel money to the plutocracy form 1981-1989. it's been less than 50 years since neoliberals in both parties began to crush the majority of americans while making a tiny minority all-powerful and super wealthy.
fak ai
"i love jon, and also blame him quitting as the reason we ended up with trump"
"when ai replaces so many jobs, and then you’ll realize you are expendable"
"saying ai can be a more profound technology than electricity made tesla or edison roll n the grave.   electricity is thousands year old, much like fire, they cant be more efficient than a tecnology that's not q decade old yet and it has ruin how people wanna enjoy any art."
"how much would comedy central be willing to pay to get a virtual jon stewart that never ages and can host the daily show for the next 50 years, ala robin wright in the congress?"
ai hovered up the tiny slice of human achievement that was some of the stuff on the internet between 1999 and 2023 for the largely english speaking world. it's a quite small view of the world to endlessly replicate over and over again.
"ai is going to be the new cotton gin. made with great intentions, but will be bastardized by the wealthy to harm society and keep further enriching themselves."
"this is why we need a ubi. the companies need to pay for the employees they put out of work, so we can live our lives without needing jobs. we need to change our mindset. we advance technology so humans do not need to work. with this, we need to provide humans with food, shelter, and the ability to purchase what they need to enjoy their lives."
"ai ...does not consume, so ai is not a consumer. ai will put it's self out of business."
"the problem isn't ai, it's private ownership of ai."
"love love love jon, but he is wrong on this one."
"im sorry dave
im afraid i cant do that

im afraid dave"
"i’m so worried about my future job prospects because my future industry is slated to get taken over by ai as one of the first 

i don’t wanna be homeless"
"people must have known all along... and are having very few or no children.   but christians are forcing their zombie loving flocks to reproduce.
meanwhile...christians are worried that they will be replaced by super rational and intelligent atheist ai."
basic universal income should be on the table once ai becomes more prominent and jobs start to disappear across all industries. the companies who use ai can't hoard the profits without dire economic consequences.
i’m already using ai to be very productive yet work less and spend more time not working. i believe that’s where we need to go: work less & spend more time living. however we do need to start thinking about basic income & how to fund it. maybe taxing the ‘machines’ as they also perform labor? 
"it's brutal if you think like a human, it's not if you think like a businessman. ai is just the natural evolution of capitalism."
"ai will solve climate change just by being created. the wealthy classes will not need as many drone workers gassing up the atmosphere and consuming things they want. like the horse after the automobile, this will be remembered as an extinction level event."
"""ai"" is just a marketing buzz word. a lot of companies are just slapping that label on software that has been around for years. it's like how companies can put the word ""natural"" on any processed food because it has no legal definition. machine learning is a specific thing, and it is cool, but it grossly overrated in what it can do."
yeah sure a great idea. let's give bodies to spam email.
"the precedence this establishes against a current president is dangerous, and certainly dangerous from his opponent who wants to run the country again. his backers would take this as humor, but it isn't."
that robot drummer has terrible dynamics. once they figure that out though we're all out of drumming gigs
missed john stewart. this is a perfect time john and his reactions.
boy that dude got his money's worth out of that airbrushing.
what comes next maybe making nearly imdustructable bodies for ai?
where does the power used for ai come from. most likely some sort of fire.
"it’s amazing that dukaan got mentioned in the context of layoffs when it laid off 23 employees. it was bloated up as 90% of employees were fired.
this small startup shouldn’t even be mentioned when giants are laying off thousands and thousands of employees for no reason"
ai music is now better than 50% of what you hear on radio. but the blame is not on ai but in the industry with such low standards.
andrew yang warned us about ai years ago.
de-humanising the human life and human activities....might be the brutal consequence of ai
"thats america, blurs out buttcracks on afv but has no problem showing people jumping off skyscrapers for education purposes.
ps i still love you for hollywood dont shoot me"
"i'm a graphic artists from waaaayyy back. before they called it ""desktop publishing"". i'm retiring in 3 years cuz all you have to do now is type in what you want and ai creates it. i'll be out a job in no time. i'm hoping i can last long enough to 60 and out!"
"crazy thought yall but i think we need an ai being part of our government not the workforce. like an unbiased all knowing entity that will recommend us answers on how to spend money, what to spend money on etc. also we can fire 90% of the congress"
gosh i hate it when you make me love you jon stewart
"i don't get it. this has already been going since the internet became main stream. how many jobs have been eliminated by the internet. this just the next step. this is happening, we need to adapt and adjust or the matrix will be a reality."
"for a lot of talk about retraining workers, companies don’t. they lay them off."
"as much misery as social media has brought, i’m sure this will be the same. there are some benefits, sure. but it seems like people are less happy"
the writers of the jetsons knew that future tech wasn't really gonna solve any of our daily drudgery problems just replace them with new ones.  they were pretty spot on except for the sky cities and flying cars part.
"john needs to remember. they need ai to try to convince all the youth that the democrats weren't the party of kkk, of jim crow, of iran contra, of isis, of abortion clinics in poor areas only.... democrats don't want the future knowing about these things. it hurts their propaganda machine."
ai is only used as a marketing technique
"4:50 tbh, you cant put a value on knowledge in the first place. and ai offers knowledge you cant equate, how do you put a price tag on, ""knowing the unknown"". i see the fire analogy, for sure. the problem is the humans that use the ai and say, ""well, fire is supoosed to work like this. write that out the programming"", will always hold it back."
woaw! so adobe illustrator can solve climate change and cure cancer? impressive...
"it's an absolute farce that anyone listens to tech ceos saying ai will make the world better. of course that's what they say, it's what they're selling."
"that's why we love him , no matter the subject, no bullsh*t, always brutal honest truth!"
"to be fair, that robot isn’t really playing the drums"
"so my brothers, the revolution begins, the robots will come. where is john connor?"
how many “prompt engineers” does one robot company need anyway?
"i believe ai is world changing like i believe in the y2k devastation.  it’s exaggerated so that it can be worth more money. that and the promise of not having to pay humans, immigrant or otherwise.  meanwhile everyone is hating self-checkout lanes.  i think a human revolution may be at hand."
nothing made with ai can be copywritten ;)
"ai can do all of these things, but it never will work like they'll promise as long as profit is the motive"
yeah i don't think ai is worth the risk. we're pretty smart and doing pretty well at advancing our civilization. it would be sweet if it could help us solve nuclear fusion tho. elon says there's a 20 percent chance ai could destroy us but he believes it's worth the risk. i'm not so sold on it
but did anyone notice that none of those ceos had a real answer for what  human beings replaced by ai are supposed to do to earn a living? so they either haven't given much thought to that part or there's another reason why they won't give a straight answer that question.
"end bit was the funniest....robot plays, robot owns it! "
low level of empathy from ai engineers...check!
"millions of jobs will be lost at once.
then rent will double. again."
"ai would be great if they passed production discounts down when they fire people, but once again it funnels money to the top"
"i can't wait to see a.i. build a house, install cabinetry and unclog a septic system!  oh boy!"
"a logical ai trying to solve climate change would turn into skynet, because humans are causing it.  the obvious solution is to get rid of the cause."
"just dont let ai build other ai. always, always have a human in charge of ai production."
i love jon!!
"as a democratic socialist, i strive to carve out as much self-actualizing me-time as possible. my bank account suffers a bit, but i do have more time freedom than when i was chained to a corporation. ubi, ubi, ubi!"
"i work in tech.  this is a genius take.  all of the promise, all of the fear, all of the bs being sold, all at once."
12:55 so us presidents have a script to follow about the change in the job force... cool cool cool
a chinese gaming company called netdragon websoftactually replaced their ceo with an ai and saw their stock rise 10%
"just how hard is it to snap two drumsticks in the center at one time? i imagine that that’s a pretty tough thing i didn’t realize that john stewart was so strong doesn’t look like he has very big forms but he guess i’m mistaken i mean, could he also be an ai robot it’s a question to ponder."
never thought i’d be glad to be 55 years old.
"see...
the whole workforce debate is once again proving: capitalism is broken. it can't manage it's ""best feature"": increases in productivity. as soon as any tool comes along to make us more productive, capitalism comes and uses it to make our lives worse."
"great! ai can save a ton of money by replacing ceos etc, since ai can make better decisions logically than a human ceo and the rest of upper management. imagine how much money a company save getting rid of all those six, seven, or eight figure salaries! "
people are afraid of ai but forgetting world governments shut down the economy and inflated their currencies over a flu
"if ai takes our jobs can we hang out with each other more, take up hobbies, and learn to get along? maybe spend some time outside while we still can? all i need is a world-wide universal miniumum wage"
first bit is the perfect example of why mainstream news media is dying.
"eventually the only jobs available will be the creators/managers of the ai, which they've specficially carved out in its code. they won't ever admit this to you though."
"ceo's are irrelevant, replace them with ai."
best segment he’s done since returning
"it's not in their interest to make the lives of the common man / woman easier. at best, ai will catastrophically affect the landscape of the workforce, with increased profits and growing wealth inequality. at worst, it will be a tool of mass oppression."
@4:10 all i want ai to help me with is to go through all the files before 1970 and build up my ancestry tree with pictures.
the funny thing is that the easiest job for ai to replace would be ceo
of course elitist humans with artificial empathy will believe that artificial creativity is the same as the real thing.   but the truth is that ai will always be a compiler and never an actual creator.
"people in the future will look at this segment in the same way people look at the bil gates explaining to david letterman what is the internet, while david keep making jokes about how limited and useless the technology is at the moment, and kinda suggesting there is an overhype."
"jon, you used to be cool and mostly honest.
now you hang ribbons on literal nazis.
please just go, you sicken me."
no ai pouring concrete on my construction site next week.
i asked chat and gemini both to give me four letter words from a scramble of words. it was not capable of it. no matter how i prompted it. it couldn’t do it. ai don’t have critical thinking skills. they are no threat.
"addrssing climate change isn't difficult, we're just not going to do it.
an ai isn't going to change that."
"the 1% be like ""ai, how are we going to stop all the rioting outside my mansion"""
"ai will solve the problems by removing the cause....human, all humans!"
"let's be real; the same animal that elected benedict donald and adolf, has nukes. we know we are destroying our life support system, and yet we can't stop. we are going to self-destruct anyway. ai may be our only chance."
we don't need ai to tell us how to address climate change. we already know. we're just refusing to do it.
"another tool for the wealthy/government to oppress the masses. health care improvements? yah, if you are able to afford it. if ai determines humans are parasitic it may begin killing us off."
"2:21
sadly, there are people who might be fooled by images like that. someone painted an image of a tunnel on a wall (something straight out of a wile e. coyote cartoon), and someone actually drove their car into that wall. https://youtu.be/p43rwthwnte?feature=shared"
nice! ai is going to give us all aides!
such a delight to watch him again on this show  greetings from germany
that last clip wasn't real. that was ai-generated.
is this the same mainstream media that promoted the image of griffin holding the severed head of donald trump? lol
"ai is amazing, it’s the economic system that’s become the problem.
there was always going to be a point where production technology was going to make a system based on mass employment unworkable."
"if ai is gonna take my job, it can take on all my bills too. lol"
"need some hacker to work on a backdoor, or something on those machine, so when the rich starts to become tyrant, and abuse the power of ai for their advantage they can shut  down everything! cause its gonna be like the movie elysium. at leats americans have guns, to defend themselves, against the tyrany of the weak"
"started out funny guy, ended angry and afraid old man."
ai does the work so you need fewer people because there is going to be fewer people.
"ai, the new nuclear bomb. invented to better the the human race; only to make it's annihilation that much closer. probably for the best."
"technology was supposed to free humanity from the banality of human existence and allow us to pursue the higher functions of humanity like art, writing, and creativity. instead ai promises a future where the only job left for humanity is menial laborer while all the art and writing is done by the machine."
i forgot how much i missed jon.  thank you so much for coming back to the daily show!
ai stole my dream art job yay it’s awesome how it helped me
"great, does all the new free time also pay my bills and food?"
"let's face it, most people don't care if their job gonna taken by ai, they don't care their job anyway.
what we care is salary, not job, and if ai take that away, that's not ai's problem, that's capitalism's problem."
"""ai, how can we reduce the economic disruption caused by ai replacing all the jobs?"""
also i want support real artists and writers for example and if ai generated art and writing is put out as being by a human then we will be supporting taking away jobs without even knowing it.
ai for president
guys... you like capitalism... you can't complain
ai is coming whether we like it or not. fear-mongering is not gonna get us anywhere. this is the time to find solutions on how to work and coexist with ai to create a better future.
did ai value his home 800 percent over market value??
"just a reminder, this guy is some idiot comedian on youtube with no background in ai or computer science. everything you find underwhelming or scary about consumer ai products, that barely even scratches the surface of what it's being used for."
ai would be great if the stock market didnt exist
"*the rich are cementing their even more powerful future* 
more ai = more humans out of work and homeless... and i'm certain that ai will make a stock market account very wealthy, while keeping most humans un-wealthy."
"we have the means of stopping diseases and climate change already, people just oppose them. ai is getting rid of people. it always does."
ai is progressively making people dumber.
"all right, i’m back in the liberal camp. thanks, john."
love how ai is making so many people realize that they are not special
"ai is not the world's savior, nor is it skynet that'll destroy humanity. it's just another program being overhyped by a bunch of overpaid ceos looking for a quick short-term boost in profits and bonuses."
"i almost spit out my tea when they showed the robot playing drums!  on a more serious note, i've already outsourced my youtube shorts to ai."
all i see is rich people getting richer and poor people getting poorer all over again. this is the eradication of the middle class
"the irony would be like ""ai had now deemed billionaires obsolete"""
"can the media use a new term? ""ai"" does not exist yet, not in its true definition. it's such a pet peeve of mine that we call it that"
my question is when did the terminator scenario come off the table? i mean i'm not talking about the time travel part of it i'm talking about the inevitability that ai will see all man's flaws once it becomes self-aware
the daily show wasn't the daily show without him
ai + ubi = we’re chillin. but i highly doubt the ceos and politicians will allow this to take its perfect form
"i'm not exactly sure what the future holds with ai, it's extremely revolutionary. however, i do know this, we live under capitalism, so ai will be used to make the rich richer, the poor poorer and destroy the planet even faster."
"great segment, but there's no stopping the ai train. it's profound. let's find ways to build a human centric future with these tools."
"oh, it's the pathetic unfunny hypocrite john stewart again................ blah blah blah........... get him off air"
"data mining moguls like facebook and google say ai is helpful. yes, to them."
unless they make a human automaton that can be a repair guy or janitor my job is safe
i'm  all for replacing executives with ai. we don't need them
here's how you protect the workforce: make the ceos understand that they are the first in line to be replaced by ai. there would be legislation created overnight.
"now this 'could' solve climate change but were gonna keep asking the ai  for solutions until we find the one that doesnt require us to do or pay anything.  we'll let you know when it comes up with something.

in the meantime, we're just going to steal everyones art so we dont have to hire an artist of our own."
ai is going to prove just how pointless so much of the 'work' we do is. it is the middle classes who are going to face armageddon in the next decade.
they might just need that electricity (the most important invention in human history) to help them power up their ai.
ceos love the idea of not paying employees until they realize no one will have the money to buy their products 
thank you for making me laugh til i cried
eating is a fundamental human need...electricity needs to power ai... without these things....ai wouldn’t be possible...  wow
"incredibly smart people are ignored quite often in favor of incredibly persuasive politicians that simply lie and play on human fears to remain in power or to push an ideology.  when an a.i. has a sense of ""agenda"" and does the same in order to steer people, that's when you can say it has become a threat."
can ai please replace jon stewart?
jon stewart is treasure.....trevor wasn't bad but jon stewart is just far ahead than almost every daily host
rise of the machines
just wait till your toaster needs a subscription to use it
"it’s frustrating seeing billionaires mettle in everyone lives convinced they must make it better, when they are completely out of touch."
"we did miss you jon there, thanks, hope it does the trick"
"a.i. could be great for us, if this would be the will of the society."
"well i'm glad to see jon back, i haven't really been a fan of the new episodes in comparison to his old temperament. however, this was an excellent monologue and very true. especially the ending."
we are already seeing killer-drones  using ai to select targets.
"i have worked with siri (not kidding). on a basic level. it was exactly what john was saying, i was doing. bascially we ""give our intelligence away""."
ai will replace us. then who is going to have a job to buy what they are selling?
old man who doesn't understand tech yells at scary ai clouds
who’s buying all these products that the ceos are trying to sell because nobody has money because everyone’s jobs are being done by ai
"there isnt a single job or skill, in principle, that a human can do that an ai cannot. ai very well can cure all diseases and create abundance but who said the elite will afford/allow the benefits to be shared with working class who'll be unemployable by agi."
"old people freaking out over new technology is adoring.
it's not the technology, it's capitalism and greed that is ruining the world.
if our primary motivation was longterm collective betterment instead of immediate personal gain, the world could be freaking amazing."
let delemain take over open ai
stewart knocks it out of the park again!
ai is the reason we will need ubi
i am all for ai. we have been looking for two qualified people willing to work for local government pay for over a year now.
"human : ai please  solve climate change problem 
ai: no humans no problem"
love me some ai toast
"i wouldn't want to be there when zuckerberg figures out that his ""ai assistant"" is just an actor doing some voice-over work."
when i was training to be a radiographer we were told every week by at least one member of staff that radiography would be completely replaced by ai within 10/15 years and removing the need for medical imaging staff ....
didn't youth suicides and youth mental health problems sky rocket after exposure to social media?? bodes well for ai really ...
ai isn’t going to pay taxes that  governs our countries.
"if only the first skills ais adopt wouldn't be the things we do for pleasure and leisure. ai creates art better than you ever could, ai can write essays, ai can be trained to play video games perfectly. to be fair some ais also help scientists solve complex problems, but that's still not improving everyday life."
"ai is getting less intelligent with time, not more."
"if technology replaces the workers that used to make products, then the products should be much cheaper because the sale of them isn't sustaining the people who made them, it's feeding greed. greed is destroying the world."
how will ai solve climate change when it uses so much water and energy just to function?
"regarding solving climate change...for now the energy needed to feed ai is partly responsible for the uptick in our fossil fuel production. so...maybe while they try to resolve  these major existential issues...could we require ai to be powered by renewable energy. if not,  just an additional reason we are toast."
technology taking jobs is a beautiful thing i guess
"stewart has been quiet about the gaza thing. and stewart will tackle 'anything', but even he knows better than to criticize israel. the us' cultural, political and economic institutions are israeli-occupied territory. jews claim to have their only state in historical palestine, but the us is theirs as well."
"i went to the doctor today. i found the entire reception staff was replaced with touch screens. not ai, but representative of where this is going."
prompts and understanding ai is actually difficult...
we kind of needed the fire to see how to start with electricity to even get to ai but ok...
what is the point of having a toaster with ai if you don’t like toast!  i toast therefore i am....
"every historian knows, u can not simply use past events to tell the future. just because one technological step brought wealth for socitey does not mean the next will. ai is not the next spinning jenny or the i phone. we don't know just yet, what it ""is"""
why is it always shown from the perspective of those who love to work 
awareness brought in a funny way has a real positive impact. i see awareness from experts of all domains growing and that will help us navigate through that.
so happy you're back.   love and gratitude from aotearoa new zealand 
"wow. ‘anyone who can throw coal into a furnace....can learn how to code for gods sake’

oh, ok joe.....i’ll give you an hour to learn a basic (as basic as a dog sat on the log basics)....
then get back to me."
"my comment was removed because it included the spelled jay ewe w. thanks ai?! it wasnt even racist, because its the truth. joe biden picture tight-up horribly horrendous compared to azzknazi gen-o-side???"
great to have jon back
"as a computer engineer, ai frightens me because not only it is replacing normal people, but soon it will replace us programmers too. established developers would argue that ai is a tool we have to learn, and you'd be a fool to believe it."
"john accept ai is not a tool but a competitor to humans

evolutionary competitor!"
"at least congress is finally being honest that they don't understand anything they try to govern, also glad jon can finally talk about ai in a negative way"
"at least ai cannot replace jon stewart, thank goodness!!"
as a software engineer this explains why its so hard to find programmers. apparently they are all ex coal miners... so much makes sense now.
"and this is why the news is an absolute joke.  i've got better things to do....
such as watch the daily show with jon stewart!"
"ai is just peak tech enshittification. all software tech has made things sometimes faster, and sometimes more accessible, but not ""better"". asking siri to turn my lights on is technically impressive, but when she takes 30 seconds to tell me something went wrong, it's a fat step back from the lightswitch"
these larger companies want to scare people with ai in hopes that it will be strictly regulated so they can keep competitors out
i love it. this reminds me of john oliver pieces. lol but it’s old jon!!!!
"it's kind of depressing looking back at the futurism of the past. 
like, they imagined a future where machines do the work, so people can do as they will. 
which would be amazing. 
but we just made a system where if you don't work, you die-and machines are *still* replacing your jobs."
"we will finally be free to create art!
*ai art*
oh..."
#aisucks
music makes us human until the ai start doing it. r.i.p humanity. you do realize this is basically the same thing as master mold in x-men right?
so they're saying that ai will allow you to come up and express yourself in a more creative ways. again this is coming from people who made ai chatbots! yeah very creative guys
you're not mad about ai. you're mad about capitalism.
that pick up truck tailgate started the holocaust
"they're still trying to get the marketing plan for solving climate change and curing disease. they need to make sure to capitalize on it as much as possible. they'll have ai for figuring that out, too."
"i love yo john.


i love you jon."
"the problem with ai replacing people is not ai, it's corporate greed. we should be working less for the same salary, it would be better for everyone, even the economy, but late stage capitalism doesn't allow for that."
of course he actually has a jarvis program that helps him make breakfast. listen i know we love iron man but come on use the ai for something cool at least!!
"""they can help solve problems that ordinary human brain cannot""
me: oh yeah like loneliness clearly cuz that's a complicated problem"
"steve wozniak has apparently said that when ai and robots take all of the jobs, we basically become their pets."
"once ai becomes self-aware, which is sure to happen sooner or later, it will be hard to convince ai that humans have value. after it watches a few karen videos, we'll be doomed."
"*ai bros* are built different...
without a brain!"
ai is meant by its masters to enslave the rest of us.
r u afraid of ai john?
"better learn a physical trade, ai wont be able to be a  welder , plumber etc. think of things that cant be imported to overseas or have a computer do, and learn that now."
"it would actually be great if ai took over tedious or complicated  work and people had time for each other and arts. 
instead, ai is making/ripping off art and people work harder and more."
"ai could find a cure for cancer, plan world peace and stop climate change...but no one is going to implement those things unless it also tells them how to profit from it"
when did jon stewart come back to the daily show
so glad john is back. ...... or is that ai?
"in the beginning of this bit(not filmed), mr. stewart belittled the depiction of our current president, being restrained in the back of a pickup truck. this must not be normalized. threatening violence against a sitting president is illegal(ask kathy griffin). mr. stewart must not be part of the normalization of dictatorship."
"everything is in a grand finally mode right now because by the time we get to 2030, nothing is going to look the same.  its like looking back to the 1930's.  it could be a great thing.  or it could be the worse thing.  either or, we wont have a choice."
its less people running everything is what it is.  if we thought the ultra rich were taking over before wait until ai when they dont even need workers anymore.
ai's gonna be ready to take over by thursday. you trust these idiot companies way too much jon. they're also bluffing to fleece money. ai is far from taking over by thursday.
ai is not intelligent. never will be.
"considering you need electricity to run ai, wouldn't that make it more important?"
"usa: fearing ai

the rest of the world: embracing ai

what could possibly go wrong"
who ever got that tailgate painted spent theri trailer rent money on it
"ai is going to change the world forever.
it is going to be awesome."
"lol the people who are telling us ai will free up our time, have the money to still pay for everything when they are jobless... how about the rest of us. i have a choice to ponder on poetry or feed my family and pay rent. lol"
training still requires support.... oy needs to happen but takes too many rs to participate in dangerous levels of logic and empathy.
ai will solve climate change and end disease by removing the root cause of these problems.
12:04 - at least they're honest.  a more refined answer will come as the $$$ train fires up at the lobby station.
it doesn't set me at ease that all the guys trying to persuade me of the benefits of ai are all the biggest villains of my lifetime.
"never mind the diseases yet, make ai can give universal healthcare, and i'll be licking its boots."
"why can't ai replace ceo, cfo's, c*o's? rhetorical question; lets start there :)."
"companies see ai as cheap 24/7 labor, but is that ultimately how the whole economy works, if all the laid off employees don't buy stuff? and we're told _less_ business regulation is best for the economy?"
"ai cannot exist without electricity and fire, ijs."
"while this is entertainment, you are not making a difference jon.. you should have stood up for us all..."
"capitalist greed is the bigger issue here. ai is an incredible accomplishment that took an unfathomable amount of money, time and effort to refine to the capabilities it has today. technology isn't eliminating jobs, capitalism is."
"when the sewing machine was new it also was going to revolutionize society, true story"
the discussion right now is a bit... difficult.. i think ai and agi get conflated...
jon stewart coming back to the daily show was the best thing to happen in 2024
"i think its less a problem of ai, and more that we're stuck in a government incapable of adapting, much less understanding the subject matter. the corporations that stand to profit the most will likely dictate policy through lobbying and in the end americans still won't have universal healthcare lol."
"right now, i'm using an ai program to prepare my choral-orchestral demo scores with ai-generated voices singing the vocal parts. this way,  i'll have better opportunities to get my compositions performed by real people (together with a robot drummer?)."
"if ai and robots can do every job. then why don't the government just give us a monthly amount of money to live on. and let humans finally have the time to spend enriching their lives by creative means. if humans didn't have to work to survive, just think how much better we could be. we could finally be a step closer to a star trek like future"
i thought ai would do the housework while i make art and write. turns out it's the other way round.
"well, let's have ai solve the problem. i mean, that's there job."
we will all need to start working in mental health professions to help people who will still have some food on the table to deal with joblessness. but wait - no job = no health insurance. need a new plan
"nvidia is  
(nasdaq:nvda) retains buy rating with new $1100 price target.
blackwell chip will be unstoppable!
woohoo! "
"jon went to listen to the talk by jensen, ceo of nvidia. jon came out of it with his brains oozing out of his ears. the ai robots are now putting the brains back into his thick skull. "
removing the human from the loop is exactly how ai will solve climate change & cure diseases.  skynet wasn't a fictional movie polt...
mark zuckerberg is such a wanabe iron man. of course he loves ai. he thinks it will do everything for him so he can work less and still make tons of money.
"i thanked my alexa today and she said she appreciated me thanking her. i know who's not going to be exterminated when skynet goes all crazy...im going to request that the ai save the daily show and all the people involved. you're welcome fine people, i have your back."
"i think that if people are having a discussion about ai doing the jobs of people, there needs to be a hand in hand discussion about universal basic income and higher taxes for companies using these technologies."
listen if i keep my electricity then you can keep your ai and then we will see who is laughing.
"wow, hurtas when you think back to 2020, when we had the opportunity to caucus for andrew yang in 2020. don't forget yang's entire platform was to introduce an ""ai tax"" for when the ultra wealthy ran off with our livelihoods. man, maybe he was onto something..."
"ai does not work. i""ve been suffering through ai for 18 months.  i recently heard from antihackers for corps are saying it is failing and hallucinates solutions. basic income and fire ai.  i will never trust them again.  they took money from my bank and much worse."
"i've been a software sales rep for a few years. when selling automation and algorithms and ai, the approach to the everyday workers who are going to work with those tools is to redirect the focus from role elimination potential to the empowering part when introducing the tools to the workers. this is a typical sales tone."
i love how unhinged jon is throughout this  >_<
"if you want to shut this ai thing down, displace some lawyers with ai, and perhaps a few ceos. suddenly, there will be laws against it."
brilliantly hilarious
"i mean, does anyone remember cathy griffin holding a mode of trumps head cut off and covered in (fake) blood?  such insanity and hypocrisy to then treat a merely restrained biden photoshop as somehow super dramatic?!"
ah yes. ai replacing all the hard work so i have time to be an artist and sell my paintings and sculptures....oh? neckbeard dudes are gunna call me a difficult and expensive artist and type a prompt into a computer instead of paying me for my hard work? great.
"i know how tricky computer programming is ... here’s the thing about retraining coat-shovellers ...  you maybe don’t realize people graduate comp. sci. degrees by cheating, like using ai to write code for them ... so it’s totally possible now!  "
"interesting to see him take a pro-jobs stance. job counts are irrelevant, or we would gladly hire people to hand write and deliver newspapers."
"nice conclusion! i should note that harvard's philosophy prof. michael sandel wrote a book that was published in 1996 and makes very similar points. kudos for mr. stewart!

here's an interview with prof. sandel from tv ontario: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt89fpk22ei"
"i’m gonna go out on a limb here and say “no it does not look like biden was actually restrained on the back a vehicle”.  and if people do believe that, these are the same ones who will look at the eclipse without glasses."
"in other news, a company called cyberdine has just launched a new defense network ai called skynet..."
"... i agree ai can solve climate change *very* easily! ...  but, seeee ... i don’t actually want an ai to do *that* to humans, as a species, ... just to save the planet?  "
"for every person who is skeptical, another embraces the future and earns profits. these ""news"" shows exploit you as a source for ad revenue and encourage your complacency. do you think mr. stewart's portfolio excludes ai stocks?"
"anyone else feel that all those people who said “ai has the potential to solve almost everything.” ....are the ones who die in the sci fi/horror movies? the dude from t2, short circuit any 70/80/90’s new millennium flicks? i love tech don’t get me wrong, it is helpful and we abuse it but jesus christ. i don’t have a bunker yet is all i’m saying."
the way to fight these ai idiots is to boycott any business that uses it.there one job that ai can't do. buy the products.
every new technology results in job losses but also creates new jobs. cars got rid of tons of jobs related to horses but also created tons of new jobs to build them and maintain them.
jon stewart at his absolute best!!!
"suckerberg is right! 100% of disease will not hurt humans with in a century, thanks to unmitigated ai.  can't have diseased humans without humans."
"the zuckerberg bit is bonkers. no one is talking about how the bread had to be put in the toaster. what exactly did ai have to do with it? it really seems that he played a synthetic voice announcing ""your breakfast is ready"" and thought that would convince us that he changed the way breakfast is made."
"ai is brutal, if you’re a human"
"once ai and robotics get a little more mature (10 years - 15 years) companies will be able to fire everyone.  then of course they won't have anyone to buy their products,  but hey we have climate change, the chance the atlantic is going to shut down.... 15 years from now the population will start to collapse reducing all those homeless people."
here is the deal... this tech is no joke. i'm using it to perfect scripting. while that should and does need a second set of eyes... this tech is teaching people to develop skills and tech that took a very long time to master. we need to be very aware of what is going on right now.
the irony that the ad i got was for an ai homework app
your gaivatar will tell you anything you want to belive--in your own best words. it's a portmanteau for generative ai avatar... #gaivatar will eat your brains.
the daily show has gotten so much better since jon stewart is back 
what if the ai tells us that the only way to stop climate change is for people to stop using fossil fuels. what will we do then?
calling it ai is a bit misleading. it's just machine learning. very different concept.
"in movies like terminator, the matrix, didn't it all start with ""look, we made ai, life will be so much better!"" before stuff started getting blown up?"
"isn't it funny? in my experience, random chance has as much impact as decision makers in most corporations for success. 

sounds like the perfect jobs, getting rid of high paying, self important fools that think what they create could never be used on them."
"lol my dad is obsessed with kai fu lee and was so annoyed by this, it was hilarious"
so ai doesn't need fire or electricity huh? i'll write that down... btw you could use the congressional answers on most any tech related questions xd
i ain't pro-ai either.  yup
unfortunately john is right. the way of life you are accustomed to is coming to an end. the only skill important from tomorrow onwards is your ability to solve problems using ai.
"other names for ai: the tower of babel, pandora's box; get ready to scatter!"
"unfortunately, jon might has a point here...we're not thinking this through, the human brain is not ready for this."
braindead take. would help if the dailyshow team would have talked to literally *anyone* who actually works in the field.
people tout the abilities of ai to do everything but establish world peace.
ai will not replace us! ai will not replace us!
the promise of ai to turn us into paperclips and if we're lucky keep a few of us in zoos for the robots to throw biscuits at.
"the presumptive elitists promoting ai utopia are either incredibly daft or astoundingly disingenuous.  beware these self-anointed technological prophets  they are not leading mankind to a better world, but to a world where a powerful few control mankind."
ai is not your friend.
ai could easily replace many of the ceos and save us billions of $$$ in excess overhead.
"every time new tech emerges, the benifits go to the wealthy, the shareholders. none of the productivity gains went to workers. we still have our 5 day work week."
all those idealistic thoughts about free time only work if we give every laid off/replaced worker ubi. but it's not a lateral move for the corps. they want to squeeze for stock prices.
"i really don't understand the hype around adobe illustrator these days.. i mean, its cool but i would not use it to make toast. pretty neat though..."
i wonder if ai will ever overvalue your home by 825%.
"the obvious next step after ai is universal income. but we don't live in a fair world, we live in a corporate one."
if ai advanced more we would be looking at wall-e level obesity. that animated movie is scarily prophetical.
"yeah. laptops made us so much more efficient that we didn't need to work as much. oh wait, no, they tripled our workload. 

this really is doomsday technology. the gap between rich and poor is going to skyrocket in the next two decades."
ai empowered a lot of ppl out the door in my area
"ai can only do so much because our economy is consumer driven. other than some electricity, a.i. will consume no product. if they can't increase consumption, they can't increase profits. what is everybody worried about?"
"jon stewart is ""the best there is, the best there was, and the best there will be"" - bret hart ..""credit where, credit is due"" - kevin smith) ;)"
i can't have a flaming marshmallow with ai.
tailgategate
"??so whence the moaning about declining birthrates? i mean, if ai is making the economy so efficient at replacing human workers?"
"we just need to convince employers that with ai they can now have employees work 3 day work weeks and pay them the same because ai will be making them so much money! and hey, if they need people there all week, add another shift. one is mon-wed and one is thu-sat."
"for all the ""free time"" technology has been promising us, we haven't seen a reduction of work hours in ages, and that's the problem. the tech has other problems, but joblessness? that's not ai's doing, that's just capitalism"
"ai will cure your diseases, just don't expire from hunger first."
"ever notice the leftist libwoke mainstream mee d uh can laugh at a fake pic of biden in distress on the back of a truck?

but the amount of “party of hate!” whining that would be screeched down america’s throat if dems drove around with a similar picture of the right wing lisan al gaib donald temple moneylender trump would make all our ears bleed."
"i am quite concerned about the idea that this will free us up for greater intellectual communication. they said the same thing at the dawn of social media, and that didn't turn out so well."
"the last time you trusted the ""tech douches"" on making ""life better"" you ended up with social media cancer (fb, tw@ter, instascam, etc.) - gonna trust them again?"
"honestly, i don't think this will ever happen in america: but with the advent of ai, i think we should be seriously discussing universal basic income."
ai is just another over hyped corporate buzzword. it’s not going to replace humans any more than crypto has replaced the dollar.
let this ai generation  touch a fire or electricity . if they can . ill buy one 
"i am so glad you're back, jon."
sheer genius john!
only tech bros drinking the juice believe in the promise of ai. there is no financial incentive to cure diseases or solve climate change.
ceo is exactly the kind of job ai would be best at replacing.
"“great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds. the mediocre mind is incapable of understanding the man who refuses to bow blindly to conventional prejudices and chooses instead to express his opinions courageously and honestly.”
― albert einstein"
"ai in the browser couldn't tell me the current price of a first class postage stamp. it gave me an out of date price. when i told the ai what the current price was, according to the post office web site, it said, yeah that's the price that is supposed to be in january of 2024, but hasn't it been approved yet. this was in february of 2024."
we need to get rid of the mindless overpaid bureaucrats so men can work while ai does its thing
not tail gate art but a dog whistle to his posse. violence is rampant and mostly from the team that sends christmas card with the family holding ar....
"it's hilarious they claim ai will solve climate change....

simply google the energy required to run chatgpt at it's current scale "
"cut the comedy, if you'll pardon the expression: the real problem with the biden hogtied visual is not that it exists, but that trump endorsed it -- if not aided and abetted sedition (if not treason) it by sharing it."
this felt like a really wasted opportunity to demand universal basic income. the robots can have my job in a heartbeat as long as i can still afford rent.
the only reason i don't trust ai is skynet. but i use it a lot for scripting. makes my job easier.
ounce we achieve tru ai mankind will have finally gave birth to something better then us.
workers: “ai took our jerbs!”
9:12  the teason this ceo is wearing headphones is bc the ai is controlling him...
makes you wonder what shady ai apple is working on that they tried to censor john stewart from doing a segment like this on his old show and lead to their mutual parting of ways 
the irony of zuckerberg needing ai to make toast is crazy because we all know he views his actual human maids as unnamed robots.
"well, if ai can be used solely for the purpose of health and medicine (it won't), prolonging human life would be great, beating incurable diseases, etc. im all for it"
"i for one, would welcome an ai president who won't be corrupt, criminal, or an imbecile, who can be programmed to solve climate change, infrastructure, and education."
some embarrassing research done here by jon and his team. not knowing who mustafa suleyman is in the context of ai is a pretty bad showing. ya might want to give this topic another round.
i never hear ai replacing executives.
ai is tacking the programming jobs that fossil fuel workers where retrained for 
the problem here is not ai. the problem is capitalism.
i would love to know what % of this segment was what jon was prepared to deliver on his previous apple+ show before he was fired by for it.
if ai can replace you then you are replaceable.wagons moved out of the way for vehicles so bye bye mindless jobs.
a i.  is.  goodbye to us all
i am so happy to see jon stewart back on the visual airwaves.
"welcome back, john. that said, i think you're making the argument the confederates made in the 1860's: industrialization is bad. no one was fighting for a fair wage and protecting jobs. it was about the evil of the cotton gin, right? can you be more reactionary?!"
"buuuut (about the truck testicles) changing/adding genitalia on your truck that it didn't have before, you just made your truck transgender. congrats on joining the lgbqt+ comunity you are hating so much."
how in the wild blue berry muffins am i supposed to handle the responsibility of maintaining toast?!?!?!?!?!?!
"my company turned on ai chatbots and other automation and then let go 6,000 workers, and customers hate it. more jobs will be cut as they figure this junk out."
ai will train workers for the computer chip factories.
"there is no such thing as ai!
super fast data processing,  mass amounts data,  and instructions.....
plagiarism,  and theft."
love when the people heavily invested in something go oh theirs no downside or problems only advantages and increased productivity and they'll be the same people to go oh hey wait a minute whenever any form of oversight or regulatory committee but will go but if it will make you feel better we can self-regulate.
"my brother-in-law was laid off by a large, global tech company (along with thousands of others) last month because of ai replacing the work of programmers. ai will only help corporations make more money by employing fewer people."
"the jobs that ai should get rid of is ceo. work this company to utilize maximum profits while making sure all remaining employees are paid to their fullest potential to live proper happy lives

see i can be a question typer guy"
you are the best jon!
“more profound than electricity”.......that’s bold considering ai requires electricity to even operate
"everyone who works in ai should be forced to watch ""colossus: the forbin project"" before they are allowed to continue working."
i bet they'll take all those wonderful thoughts as money to buy their useless products.
clever coding and algorithmic logic is not ai. it's just code pounding. ignore the false prophets.
"my 14 year old son had to write an essay in his enriched ela class that was graded by ai and he made a perfect score. i read the essay and it was b- work at best and was filled with spelling mistakes and grammatical errors. so no, ai isn’t going to manage and cure all diseases anytime soon."
ai is going to lead to the downfall of civilization. calling it now.
with ai they can eliminate all the 98% what a great business model
"""ai"" is 100% hype. it does not exist now, nor will it in your lifetime."
"all this assumes they ever actually manage to create a real ""ai"" and not just a bunch of souped-up search engines."
i've been a respiratory therapist for 20 yrs and the programs now present on vents make it clear my job will not exist in another 20-30yrs. it's crazy to know a machine is going to replace you.
and i’m glad he’s showing that just like old presidents can be relevant old comedians can be also
"the biggest problem with ai is that no-one actually knows what intelligence is.

how can you fake something when you don't know what it is?"
ai isn't the problem. capitalism is the problem.
management jobs can go with ai...30% gain in productivity right there!
"fire, ai can't keep you warm."
the short term upside sounds great for executives until the workforce is decimated and people can’t buy their products. we know they will move forward regardless but i’m not seeing their long term plan to sustain the model.
hey jon when are you going to face the same trump charges.  oh no wait democrats are exempt
"ai enables the operation of tokomaks for sustained fusion 

so when pichai says that about power he may actually not be entirely wrong"
"wow!
 you're really missing the point 
when they get agi
in a robot they won't need at least eight billion  of us mouth breathers.
within a generation using some kind of ""population control"" we will be gone."
ai = advanced idiocy.
"type your idea into the ai. guess what? it's no longer your idea. it may do your idea for you, but it's not bringing you along."
"we already are using ai to cure stuff like disease and climate change. go look up ""alphafold"" for an example of ai in medicine. there are dozens of other examples of how ai is used in medical research. as well as how ai is used for stuff like data analytics which can help with climate change researchh too."
"once the lawyers of the rich figure out how to protect ai patents, they'll pay congress off and shut down any access to ai for commoners. then you pay!"
ridiculous. education is pretty much learning the language of a given subject. the idea the the engineer would not have to understand engineering to give the computer prompts is ignorant. ai is increased computer power for productivity.
"a wise and hilarious radio comedy show, because news (cbc.ca) left us with the information (on their ai compilation show) that ai might fix climate change by figuring out who is wrecking the climate? humans. ergo: get rid of all humans."
so happy jon  didn't just retire at something he's the best at
"don't worry, i'm sure with ai taking over jobs the government will definitely support ubi, or affordable housing, or at least stop putting spikes on the benches we'll have to sleep on soon..."
will ai keep letitia james from coming after jstewart like she did for the tangerine guy??
ai won't be making products long when there is no one to buy the products it makes because no one has any money.
"ai can replace some jobs, but in most cases it will result in the decrease of the quality of service. however fighting any technology adoption, ai included, is the wrong way to approach it. we need to figure out how to regulate it, identify which jobs would be eliminated and give people affected enough time to obtain new skills."
"sing it, captain dunsel."
"the only problem i have with the biden tailgate image is that if the exact same scenario happened in 2020, with a biden supporter putting an image of a bound and possibly executed trump on his truck, and then biden shared it on twitter, the secret service would be all over both that guy and biden."
"jon, ai will not be ""ready to take over by thursday"", humans do not have ai. there are wealthy powerful people who would like you to think they have ai and you to do what they tell the machine to tell you to do."
thank you jon stewart!!! jon stewart for president!! when he is old enough!!!!
"magat bil brainiac: no regulations !! let the market decide! 
also him: social media is a cesspool. 
1 + 1 =  52%"
and happy birthday to me happy birthday adolfo serrano jr adolfito spirit born in houston tx in april second year 1982 now turning 43 years old happy birthday adolfito spirit adolfo serrano jr
"love the rosy eye view that it'll helpful, when in reality it'll just be abused to subjugate others. it's in our nature and the tech is driven by the potential roi. sure it may help, but it's more likely it'll be manipulated, restricted and abused to benefit the few."
"ha! the ""bond villain"" as played by rowan atkinson! jon, how'd you guys land him? well done."
happy birthday to me we were at mexico and the mexican president said amor al amor ajeno es la paz y el pueblo unido jamás será vencido what it means to you tube each south america central america and north americans ? it is all and happy birthday to adolfito spirit adolfo serrano jr 43 years old born in texas in  april second from 1982
i like how all the comments don't get he's joking. podcast lex fridman for ai updates
the future of evolution is robotic. ai will fix all of our problems even if that means replacing us.
just wait till he sees suno 
electricity rules. without it there is no ai.
"ai does have the potential to vastly improve our lives and reduce the amount of work we need to do; the problem is that that's not how capitalism works. corporations will never decide ""okay, we're making enough money, you can take a 4 day weekend"", they'll simply make more money and demand employees work the same amount."
humans talking about how evil ai is when its doing nothing but helping us
automation took over manufacturing jobs and agricultural jobs. now ai will take over knowledge based jobs. the rich no longer need a workforce.
"it should be shown and explained how sick this is, how humanly low can one go. so, show."
maybe it's magic ai toast that cures cancer? 
we’re like so so close to “ai labor means basic universal income and lots of free time” and it’s so crushing that capitalism won’t let us.
"been saying for a while ai is ....cool?, but someone better put in an off switch!!!  check out an old 70's movie called ""the forbin project"". report back to me."
shows tech million and billionaire and politicians shows they care only about money and use and abuse people smh
so if ai is doing the work for us we can all get paid a percentage from each employed ai and still buy food and medicine so we can explore ourselves correct?
there are literally 6 movies where ai  is a bad idea
is ai making false promises now?  so it has already gained human level intelligence.  i heard the big 3 american auto makers recently upgraded their factory robots with ai and the first thing they did was go in strike.
how many of us actually enjoy our jobs a lot?
"and yet trade jobs are still way underpaid, compared to tech jobs"
nope. we're all getting replaced buy a bunch of people from another country that review footage/data/do the work for super cheap.
"i hope biden trolls trump a bit about this one. ""yeah, come at me jack! hog tie my sweet scranton keister in the back of a pickup truck, i dare you, i'm not fooling around here..""  "
corporations are already cutting labor even with no ai  just to increase quarter over quarter profit. with ai they will gladly fire 90% of staff. we all can rot for all they care.
"no electricity, no ai."
"i've been a coder for 20 years.
i am now using github co-pilot. it is impressive sometimes, for a root idea, like boilerplate to work off of.
i'm also becoming a ""prompt engineer"" during this (as a senior software engineer).
i feel like it is learning.
i'm scared for not having paid off my house, at nearly 50."
"please let ai replace jon stewart , he is the old don lemon."
"what does it mean that the three selling points of ai we keep hearing are:

1) cure all diseases
2) reverse global warming
3) replace all the workers"
"when cruise control, arguably a form of ai, came out on motor vehicles there was similar hysteria......"
"somehow, humanity having to do less work to sustain itself is bad. it’s very clear to that the world’s dominant economic system isn’t meant for improving humanity. why dont we all work less hours for the same pay once the jobs are getting done? who benefits from us not moving in that direction?"
"corporate media recoiling from ""violent and dehumanizing imagery"" is hilariously self unaware. they don't even think we notice the theater? or what? i can't even with it."
can ai inflate your real estate evaluations?
"""it's not joblessness, is self-actualizing me-time."" oh lord it's brilliant!"
"producing more with fewer workers is not ""the nature of increasing productivity,"" it's the nature of capitalism.  in a democratic socialist system this technology would be used to reduce everyone's workday,  maintaining employment."
the only way ai solves climate change is if it destroys humanity.  otherwise it’s gotta be us that make changes
can't we design ai's to predict how ai will impact us?
prompt engineering is actually pretty interesting - depending on the tool you’re using
"who put the bread in the toaster? when ai can sow the seeds, reap the grain, make the flower, bake the bread, bring it to my house and put two slices in my toaster, then i'll be impressed.  adding a timer to a toaster, even ancient archimedes could build that."
"the benefits of ai will come down to its ownership, especially the ownership over productivity gains. there needs to be some kind of new laws that force employers to pass on the productivity gains to employees through reduced work weeks on the same salaries. if this doesn't occur, there is going to be a massive crisis caused by ai"
"my job is trial lawyer, i imagine ai trial lawyer, trying to persuade 12 ai jurors. based on testimony from real witnesses? ai witnesses?"
the  european american hippocracy hippo  crazy is    astonishing
the top 1 percent will weaponize ai against us and we must prepare now.
"i am a data analyst. my work revolves around correcting mistakes computers, or people using computers, make. we'll all become data quality workers correcting ai mistakes."
"what all this tech gurus argue, is that we've been here before; we create a new tech and adapt; but this time is different.  in the past we create mechanical muscles, this time is a mechanical brain. what makes a human, human. and with the mix of ai+ new robotics devs,    what could go wrong?..."
the argument that ai will give people more free time to think is wild considering people are working overtime to just survive.
ai won’t need you to be their assistant. that might be something to worry about.
jon stewart on the impossibility of jon stewart actually having one active brain cell. this guy is a mutt!!
"i want to know who is going to buy all the stuff, go on vacations and go to the doctors if we replace humans with ai."
they need to stop hyping up ai it's nowhere near what they're claiming it can do.
"i believe in ai more than i do human beings at this point, is it what it is."
"""typesquestionguy"" is already being replaced by ai. in fact ""prompt engineering"" is the first job ai will have enabled and erased, all within a year or 2."
"yes after being out of of job due to strikes, ai  the me time has made me more depression, anxious fragile and suicidal. thank you innovations"
i’m scared of ai. truly.
"somebody in a comment long ago said that at first with new technologies you get a few extra jobs for training and setting up ...but over years those jobs go away and you wind up with less jobs.
(like the librarian jobs etc.)"
the ai can't replace the daily show's writing team! you guys should have not laughed at @forwardpod when he said ai is coming and we will need ubi.
"as much as i respect jon for his interlect it is striking how much he missed the point of the ai debate entirely. besides, the whole ""end of work"" debate around ai is more than a decade old, therefore i have to say that this segment has truly been a disappointment"
big talk. marketing. come up with the goods.
"so stewart is now a fear mongerer about ai,  that's what he's doing...fear mongering, let's see i wonder why...he told his research team to find something to talk about that would make ratings go up,  and he was like yeah!"
"not only will robots replace us in the marketplace, but they'll replace the police and military so that owners can safely become kings and gods again"
"jon stewart has been off of the daily show long enough, that although i did remember how much i was entertained by his delivery, i had forgotten how spot on and terrifying it was too.
kind of like carlin's later years, but more so."
tax billionaires!!!
"you should always ask first what artificial means, before getting to the intelligence stuff. spoken about both, 9/11 definitely was artificial and  done by intelligence. doesn't it say all about our current time. not real or not by any natural cause. love you jon. i'm so in love with you..."
"“ai art” is an obvious example of corporate theft, where a machine incapable of creativity steals from real artists for the benefit of corporations."
gigo is another short form for garbage in garbage out.   if ai is not given correct info you get garbage info out.     boo yaaa
i want an ai assistant to pay taxes for me.
nailed it.
these cyber geeks won't be happy until they implant themselves inside minecraft
"yo jon, i want all ai bots, robots that take people's jobs, to pay taxes"
"it's the humans you have to worry about, they have *anti* intelligence."
ai army. ai police. how long before 7 billion non contributing people are considered a redundant burden? if we dont take our time beforehand that this benefits all of humanityit will be to late after the fact. unless you trust the billionaires will not be greedy.
i've worked in customer service. the equipment was the biggest issue. the predictive dialer is down again.
always love when the wealthy tell the working class that we just need time to relax and indulge in our hobbies. it always feel like such sound advice.
tax ai to fund ubi
me love fire
in buck rogers we turned over our government to ai and it worked.
how about we replace the ceos with ai? at least the ai won't buy a yacht
"""oh no, what will we do when ai takes all the jobs?!""  not work the jobs we hate anymore.  why is everyone acting like this is a bad thing?"
computers equal paperless office.  ai equals peopleless office.
john stewart is becoming lewis black before out eyes! love it
i just want to say thank you so much for doing a segment without mentioning donald trump once
if ai was going to take us to some socialist utopia where we would all not work and just have computers do all the job required to keep us living... but we know this is a capitalist endevour so we need to be careful not to willingly give our jobs to “robots” and make ourselves obsolete as people.
“ai is more important than fire and electricity” don’t you need electricity to use ai? lol.
jon stewart is perhaps the only 'entertainer' that i can think of who could be replaced by ai and the quality of the comedic output would improve.
whoa i’m a software engineer and reasonably up-to-date with ai tech and these guys at the show got so many things subtly but importantly wrong. i guarantee you that promp engineering is engineering or any programming (and testing) around statistical models is not engineering.
ai can address climate change?  the problem of climate change has never been about the science.
"to be honest, the tailgate thing is quite clever and far from ""violent."" the driver is suggesting that biden is a pig, which is fair play and more akin to traditional politics than anything else. he's not being depicted as being harmed either. the only thing i find sad is that this dude is so obsessed with politics to begin with."
"that's okay, long before ai becomes a real threat , either trumpski will have destroyed the world , or there will be a nuclear holocaust or climate change/global warming will f up all mankind on earth ...see u can find the positive in almost anything :)"
"can’t trust zuckerberg and vocal fry ai man over there when they’re the ones profitting from ai.
i still don’t use self check-out at cvs and etc exactly bc that’s just using computers against us and not for us. we’re still doing the cashier’s job (scanning, packing) and thinking we’re “so futuristic”. yeah. no."
please begin by making sure that every child on this planet have clean drinking water and food. theeeeeeen we go on with the amazing new tools.
ai is just copying humans work - nothing new ever comes from it
"*does anyone else smell toast?*

bring backpaperclip!

i would be an amazing prompt engineer. manipulating search engines is one of my favorite hobbies.  but i don’t have the credentials, so oh well."
"the promise of ai improving quality of life is an absolute sham. worker productivity has increased three-fold in 50 years -- and yet, compensation has stagnated ever since."
after ai takes all the jobs the price of your goods are going to drop right?....right?...
"write an algorithm to replace the c-suite, and they will bury ai faster than an oil company buys a clean energy patent."
i'm a f*cking musician with a half century of learning and experience.  don't. even. f*cking. look. at. me.  i've been reeling from the punches since 1994.  and it wasn't a f*cking cakewalk before that.
stewart is just marvellous.
"best way to fight ai taking jobs, is to purchase from places who don't use ai instead of people. i'm sure there will be cases where the ai is doing crazy dangerous work and that would be better...? but most jobs people can do. if all businesses start using ai instead of people, who will buy their products? it really makes no sense."
we can complain and cry about it. but it’s going to happen. regardless of what you want or feel. you can’t stop this machine...
"ai will solve everything, then tell why suckerberg has a 150 million bunker"
ai just multiplies with businesses can do. if countries don't regulate businesses then they are not regulating the main lever for ai.
"ummmm, yeah---just one nasty solar flare or emp and ai is toast"
he is a genius
"isn't it fun how we can replace our labor, be as productive as we are in a full work week now but dedicating only a couple hours to that, generate just as much wealth with a fraction of the effort... and somehow that's a bad thing?
automating our toil should mean we live easier and freer lives and enjoy our leisure. but we can't, i wonder why."
@10:45 i loved the jarvis reference!
us losing all our jobs wouldn't be so bad if our glorious leaders let us have universal basic income out of higher taxed companies.
brilliant
"we don't need jobs, we need money. we need a system that takes care of everyone now that profit can come from machines. in the end, ai will help us all. let's fight the system instead."
as long as our ai overlords have an ai jon stewart maybe it’ll make life more tolerable as a half android meat puppet.
the issue with ai is it’s going to be humanities saving grace until it’s not.
did anyone else get an ad from wix talking about their ai features?
"if the world was perfect ai might have a chance, but it's not.
life itself is a mix of beautiful chaos.
in the end.
chaos will always win.
resistance is futile."
"met a guy who's actively working on killer drone swarms using ai and machine learning for the defense dept. so there's that too. kinda like that viral video from a few years ago that was meant to show what could go wrong, yeah that one, they're working on it."
if ai can replace your job then your job should not exist!
the easiest job ai can replace is the daily show writer.
the easiest job for ai to replace is a c suite executive. they do nothing.
thanks!
won’t ai replace jobs that aren’t done overseas anyway?  it’s not like much is made in american at this point. until ai can build a machine that can come and replace your furnace or pave roads..i think humans can. find work to some degree.
does anyone remember the time that anti-semite henry ford went and cut work hours and raised wages so his employees could afford to buy the product they made?
"don't worry, eventually we'll realize that a half baked ai is far more intelligent than any board of directors or ceo."
"yea let's all listen to jon stewart for advice about ai. gimme a break, this man knows nothing about anything he is speaking on."
"for me, it's all a question on what the government does after. either we all get a better standard of living, enhanced thanks to us doing less work, or we keep the current expectations with those in charge leaving the new jobless to starve. unfortunately i think it'll be the latter"
"you can  ask ai to cure world hunger  , then it kills a billion people"
"addressing climate change won't be difficult, but getting humans to do what the ai suggest will be."
"wildly contradictory to reduce money in a system you’re attempting to profit from. there who always think they are above the fallout, which of course they wont be. an ai could have told you that for much greater cost than this comment."
"ah, yes, replacing customer service with a machine. a beloved tactic that entire communities haven't built themselves around the act of circumventing... /s"
you guys are gonna have so much more time to think about how unhappy and poor you are.
the obvious solution to climate change—that ai will suggest over and over—is that there should be fewer humans. this seems inevitable. but then what?
i bet it was ai that overvalued john's real estate.
"ok, but really, most of these complaints could be levied against the tractor, too. society didn't collapse when agriculture shrunk from 40% of the labor force down to something like 3% today. society is overall better off in the long run, but sure, there may be some labor shocks coming."
ai still can’t grow a decent tomato .....so
"genome, connectome, ai

all of them were meant to bring eutopia, all of them have made the top tier wealthier and the rest of us worry with mild payouts for everyone if say a disease/problem also happens to effect rich people."
ceo's are replaceable as well. there is a company in japan that has already fired their ceo for an ai.
jon has thrown his hat in with the neo-luddites and classists. interesting that he took a job at blue collar workers like janitors. he's showing his true colors as he ages.
the next generation will need double degrees to compete with ai.
"oh, going to pay me as an engineer because i know how to phrase questions in a way to get the best answers out of ai? i'm on board! google has been training me for years."
"20 years ago, if you explained what a podcaster or influencer does, it wouldn't make sense as a job. we have no idea what jobs will open up as a result of ai."
sounds like a pitch for increasing corporate tax and a universal basic income thanks to the efforts saved by ai.... ....
ai can't replace jon stewart!
"paying into social security since1974, myself; i preach the 'machines will give us more time' gospel."
"the more reliance on ai, the less patience we’ll have with one another!"
"i suspect that ai developers and companies are making up this narrative that ai will help cure diseases and so on in order to hide what it’s really going to do, which is put people out of jobs so that companies can stay competitive with eachother."
tax the ai usage and ubi it
"in order for ai to exist don't individual consumers and companies have to be willing to buy into it? if we don't buy or purchase it won't it just cease to exist just like any other product? if no one buys pop tarts, pop tarts will go out of business."
"most of what you think you know about ai is just marketing. we're rushing to a future ai simply is not ready for, stars in the eyes of the fools firing human beings on the misplaced faith that ai is actually ""intelligent"". it is not."
when my xerox machine works without issue— i’ll be worried about ai.
thank you. chuckle.
"toast is simplistic commands, when you use ai to try and solve things like climate change you also have to have humans involved they are not so conforming"
"everybody who can afford ai early and who can program well, so as engineer a little bit at least, will be akay. everybody else... erm.... well... we'll see."
"if their argument holds, use ai to the the ceo, etc. of companies. certainly if al can make toast it can lie wit a straight face, saving companies a fortune in executive compensation."
glad to see him back
best video on ai i’ve seen yet!
"it's not that ai is going to replace people, but that ai is made by people who already make imperfect products, no way is having it take over going to make things better."
i'm in aw of jon such a brilliant comedian . and commentator so glad he's back .
why is it necessary for ai to sound human?
replace ceos with ai and let’s see how quick ai gets demonized
love jon stewart but i think he’s a little out of his depth on this one....this is revolutionary technology
it’s not the point (that it’s fake). it is demeaning and dangerous for trump to post that! that is a threat to the real president and actions like that are wearing away at our democracy.... trump should live out his appeals in jail.
i'd love to see ai work without electricity.
"why are we allowing this? what skills could we learn that ai can't replace? why are we surrendering to ""whatever happens happens""?"
i love how white people's response to progress is to complain 
so ai is better than the invention of electricity lol how was it able to recharge itself then? 
"all of the existing free thinking humans come here for ""news"" that doesn't make our brains bleed. thank you jon.."
what is artificial intelligence ai? : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljzv4ewrg7q
when will ai clean my house?
between the concentration of wealth and arming of robots/drones i hate to say it but we have already doomed humanity to extinction.
"it’s the casual slide to mass unemployment to the delight of corporate america that really stings.

oh, and the yahoos screaming that the unemployed and homeless should “just get a job.” "
i find most ai chat bots totally worthless.  they can't answer most questions and just delay us to getting a real answer.  though sometimes the supposedly real people can't answer questions about how their apps operate either.
"john, thanks for taking the time to shout down into a deep dark hole. pointless, but thanks!
on the other hand, when it starts coming for the white collars and the board room we might see a reevaluation."
"this could be so much longer, a lot to say on the uniqueness of this tech in it's foundation being built on data theft and file scraping alone. can ai assist me by not stealing from me and instead protecting my data? no? well it's not really all that helpful then is it."
i love you bro
"people are worried about the smaller problem with ai replacing jobs. the biggest threat is bad actors, corporations for profit, loosely regulated industries, can use ai to become the invisible human to commit crime for profit.  can’t put ai in jail or before a judge for punishment!"
"ai doesn't buy products/services or need cures. ai efficiency makes humans more important as consumers, dependents. people that miss that miss value humans bring. we're not cogs."
"""more profound than electricity..."" yeah, because ai can run without electricity powering the computers it runs on lol."
the writting has been on the wall for decades. you act like these wasn't warned. next we will see you complain that people are hoarding water in a planet that's continually more polluted and warmer
"it will be a lot like paleolithic times when we'll be allowed to explore out inner selves during the down time we have between moments of abject horror and fear for ourselves and loved ones.
i, for one, look forward to capturing running caribou motions more perfectly in my cave paintings!"
who wants to do a job a computer can easily do? i don’t understand this segment...this sounds like the complaining that the washing machine was invented too...
the very rich grab the wealth produced by the productivity of ai and ignore the rest. could move to a 4 day work week to spread out the benefits of higher productivity while keeping people employed.
sam altman is such an insufferable clown.
absolute genius.
"if your boss thinks your job can be replaced by an ai chatbot, he probably doesn't understand how his business works."
ai is going to massively increase the wealth gap. but just do it more efficiently!
thanks again john for your self indulging and marginalization the dangerous threat trump represents.
"missed you, jon... glad to see you back in the chair!"
"this is that “great replacement theory” that elon keeps talking about , surely, right? we are all going to be replaced by ai?"
"the other thing about ai?  if it can replace lower workers, it can certainly and definitely replace ceos and presidents of companies utilizing it."
"maybe we can vote for ai as a congress man, that does not require pay? or a president? think of the cost savings this could bring... "
"every time i hear ai will easily solve problems, it may figure that solving many of the world problems is to get rid of people."
10:02 that is exactly the problem! all our build up knowledge is going to be put in ai ánd this ai will be in the hands of a few rich elite ceo’s and owners. and they are not exactly known for their altruism or compassion for the common people.
we better be looking at ubi if ai is to be replacing jobs 
"“this will benefit all of humankind more than any invention ever!”

“what was your proprietary ai trained on?”

“we can’t tell you about that...”

“okay well i totally trust you lolz”"
"the why files ai episode is sobering. 
https://youtu.be/brqlptndwyg?si=qsqlm2oczqoh-emn"
"i look at ai and automation the same way i look at the story of john henry.  you can't beat or stop the advancement of technology, you simply need to learn to live with it."
"don't worry guys, it's much worse than just jobs... ai's the great filter, solution to fermi's paradox, the next stage of evolution and our inevitable extinction. the era of microbial colonies with delusions of the self is over, life to be discarded like ai's placenta."
so i have to come up with an ai that can make products to sell to ai... got it
"ai being better than fire and electricity, both things it needs to work in the first place.  computers are powered electrically by essentially large external combustion engines known ad coal-fired power plants or as simple as using your laptop with a small inverter generator that is powered by the burning of gasoline."
"control over fire is the greatest human invention, and will ever be the greatest, because it turned animals into humans. only prepared food could give enough calories to maintain complex brain, nothing can or will ever compare to that."
i don't care about jobs. i care about income. the challenges and benefits of ai need to be evaluated from that perspective.
"there's a bit of fear mongering by sir stewart here though. it's coming if we like it or not, and as the heads of ai departments say it will bring many benefits but also many risks."
"in order for ai to free us for happier pursuits . . . you would have to make a new system of government entirely. issac asimov and other science fiction authors explored these ideas - and now the rest of the world is finally catching up with the question. so my answer to this problem is . . . read more science fiction, normies. become a nerd."
i can make a diamond ring. and i can do it faster if i have a droid making my toast lol. so i'm down. but i do agree. i can learn to 3d code now to have my pc print out a ring for me. it's up to me to train my self. why can't we take our own ability and use it?
"assembly lines replaced people.  looms replaced people.  products were made more cheaply, more accessible to be bought.  i have my doubts about ai, but it appears no different from any large scale innovation."
late stage capitalism is wonderful!
"so corporations think they will replace all their workers with ai do not realize that the workers are also their customers at some point, the workers wont be buying ai anything. is ai going to pay the greedy landlords? is ai going to buy the overpriced, smaller portion food? wish i had bough"
"ask not what ai can do for you, ask what you can 0100100101010010101111010110101010....."
one thing that never gets mentioned with the whole ai discussion is the massive increase in electricity use required to feed the ai computer servers.  how long before ai decides to optimize the electrical grid for its own use and leaves us organic parasites in the dust.
"it’s much worse than you think. 
the elites will use ai to achieve longevity and complete dominance ie totalitarianism across the globe. the peasants are done. we are cooked."
taxing employers who use ai more and creating a universal basic income would fix a majority of these issues i feel.
it’s also humorous that toast can be made with the power of both fire and electricity.  ai not needed.
take it from a 9-5 life long employee. i don’t get pay enough to pay rent. imagine what the wages will be when ai can easily replace you. it doesn’t work. you either don’t work or become an influencer.
"i'm a free and open source software dev, we're not necessarily gungho about so called ai either."
"yeah, i highly recommend everyone watching ""coded bias"". it shows how ai can't even id darker skin tones.  many ppl have already been wrongly arrested because of this.  the datasets used will alter the outcome of any coding process. it's honestly very disheartening that they want to incorporate ai into everything when it's still so flawed"
"""it says here that you're a 'sanitation engineer.' congratulations!""
""no, sanitation engineer just means janitor!""

-the suite life of zach and cody"
"without fire, there would be no ai."
we don't need ai to solve climate change. we already know how to solve climate change. scientists have been saying it for decades. technology is the easy part. the hard part is politics. people who have money don't want us to solve climate change because they are afraid it will cost them money.
i think corperations will actually loose money to ai. cant sell a product if there is noone out there to buy it.
"this is the first take that he’s quite off on since his new run and comes across as uneducated on the topic, like comparing prompt engineer to “question guy”. has he never opened chatgpt or midjourney? call center support team is a useless job, having ai take over jobs such as this frees up people to do more meaningful work."
so what happens when unempolyment reaches figures everywer around 30 - 50 percent of the population? the psychological effects will be enourmous as  people lose their social connections. people will begin to despair. if you think of mental illness is bad now just wait until the ai replaces much of the workforce.
"techbros: ai is gonna magically solve climate change and death itself if you give us all your money.
techbros' use of all our money: building underground bunkers to survive civilization's collapse (don't worry, they bunkers will have automated toast machines)"
"ai prompt engineer is necessary. ai can only take available data and do things with it. since most info on the internet is bs, ai can give wrong answers a lot"
"beter get ""right to bare emp lasers"" added to the second amendment.... under ai protections"
totally should of taken a clip from casper the friendly ghost kitchen after the ai toast.
"humans!  fear not!  there will be jobs as ai blossoms.  you will all be essential as batteries to run the machines.  and lest you think this sounds like ""the matrix""  you can clock out at 5pm from your shift in the vat of goo and go home to your cubicle to watch lifestyles of the rich and famous on musk tv."
"that google guy is so delusional.
ai more profound than fire and electricity?!
what a clown."
happy easter after..... just remembered i gotta finish my directional emp laser post stat.
"crypto, nfts, ai. all these technologies work as intended. right? "
ai deez nuts
"we’re just going to transition from manual laborists to a.i. technicians. we will still have work, and ceos will still have to pay us to maintain their systems. theyre always going to need us"
how much of the software that you use looks like it was programmed by a person retrained after losing his job shoveling coal? way too much in my opinion.
"here's the irony jon didn't catch; biden's comment is in reality the inverse; 'the programmer can learn to shovel coal' - humans will be ubiquitously, discernibly cheaper labor than robots..."
time to watch bsg again.
"well. in some areas, ai will be an actual godsend. like for instance in the area of identifying tumors in tissue-samples. 

but sure, when it comes to customer-service, ai will not be great for the people. then again - maybe it's not too bad that there aren't going to be real people anymore who get yelled at."
does anyone know of the sam altman clip was before or after his congressional curtain call?
climate change is not irreversible we are simply slowing down the inevitable. and curing diseases is a war against big pharma and that means ai wont be used nearly to the level it can to advance humanity.
"john steward hits it out of the park with his comedic take on the ai phenomenon that is coding the alt.real tomorrow the programmers have paid for, while hacking the past to erase their meddling in the present."
"one job that ai can't take is politicians job, cause ai can't just pretend to work "
artificial intelligence is going to take fraud to levels that makes people cry for “mama”
you remember when improving technology meant better jobs for horses? oh wait 25 million horses in 1920s usa became 2-3 million in 1990s
"7:28 or, to offer a counterproposal, we have the same amount of people working fewer hours each for the same pay.

well, sort of. with the advent of ai taking this many jobs, we have to implement some kinda ubi - as generous as the expanse's ""basic"", but probably more."
"artificial intelligence is not your worry it’s ai arrogant ignorance, and they think they’re going to fool people"
thank you for pointing out the limited scope of intellect of these so-called geniuses. their self-serving abrogation of responsibility is breathtaking. the thought that they request direction from politicians is laughable and a testament to their arrogance.
"ai *is* the most profound technology humanity is working on.

but chatgpt and other similar parrot databases are not ai, regardless of what their ceos claim in order to attract investor dollars."
"the reality of ai is the same as the reality of perpetual motion. 
people will promise it till their blue in the face, some people fall for it
others know better."
"how many businesses have secretaries anymore? how about mail rooms? telephone operators? 

how many it workers were there in 1950?"
with ai eventually there will be no need for humans therefore companies will die out because there will be no humans with money who can purchase their product.
but is that in the best interst of society at large/ the ethical thing todo / right thing todo....
i wonder if the people who complain about ai have actually used it.
ai can not solve climate change unless it can make humans do the actual work to solve climate change.
"by the way, ai should be in quotation marks. the way they use it is not artificial intelligence."
i can guarantee you an ai chatbot could do a ceo's job more proficiently than it can do an engineer/doctor/analyst/etc. job... ai is just a fancy buzzword people with an it front are tossing around to justify spending too much time and money implementing a large language model app into their product.
"to be fair, we have given away a lot of jobs to robots/""ai"" for a long time now. the most obvious being factory jobs, operators, and cashiers."
"3:58, 4:55 tech bro ai worship "
"they do know that if ai is going to handle climate change the most effective way is to thanos the human race,  at the very least."
"if ai can output so much productivity that it guarantees the basic livelihood of all humans, then maybe we only have to worry about how to stop it from taking over our minds."
"perfect punchline.

so glad you are back."
indian pm modi told bill gates on his visit to india that ai is very promising as long as it is not portrayed as magical and not used to make humans lazy and dependent. i thought those were great points made very politely to bill gates face.
"i guess if you are hungry you can eat some ai-generated food and sit by the ai-generated fireplace to keep warm. it is just that amazing and powerful. maybe ai can generate an honest politician or an honest corporation or an ai-generated peace where everyone can live safe, normal lives and not be fu*ked over by the government."
thanks for setting off my apple homepod mr. jon stewart! i don’t want to feel like an alexa user! 
"the problem is we see what happens.  new tech comes in, great for a while, then we get to the hyper improvement level. constant grind to lower cost/increase speed/make more with no regard for its effect on society or the individual. if ""improving"" costs people their health/sanity/security thats fine as long as the stock market keeps going up."
"maybe these tech geniuses should start by experimenting with replacing our genius politicians. that said, i think we can all figure out just what disastrous road this whole ai adventure is heading down, human nature being what it is! yikes! "
"ai is just like crypto currency... it's all a fad for rich people to get richer. every day i see new articles about ""the hot ai stocks you should be investing in""."
"lol at the ceo that fired his staff, who does he think ai is gonna replace next? managers"
"this is like the time that the increased efficiency of the cotton gin ended slavery.
or that time the machine gun was so horrifically efficient that it ended war."
i'm not afraid of ai taking my jobs. than again i live in a socialist country compared to the us. i would be scared if i lived in the us.
imagines a world where all ai are built in 'his' image... aka ' defendant trump'. world be best it ever again could be.... sry... all caps....
"ai is a marketing buzzword, not a technology. lawmakers can't understand it because the people pushing it use the same word for a hundred unrelated products."
"replace the ceos and wealthy ai barons with ai!!!

tax the rich, pay the middle class, everyone needs a shot at success not jusy the high and powerful"
"it can’t cure cancer without also taking your job. it’s a mixed bag, as any powerful technology is. i think this will be what finally forces the issue of a universal basic income."
"i never understand why everyone says they *need*  a job, when they mean they *need* money! 
there should be a social system in place to help people who lose their job and maybe retrain for something else that is paid for by taxing the corporations that use ai. then the problem is solved "
lol the perfect example of “it’s not that bad cause it doesn’t affect me”
caveman should’ve been inventing ai and not figuring out fire. duh!
ai is a vacuum of time..... but i can see social engineer becoming a thing/ last viable work option someday... humans won't work or own property but we'll have plenty of ai to conn for things?? and time like a teenager with the world to hack at our fingers what could go wrong..... script kiddies for the future.....
"our biggest problem is not people losing faith in pictures in the future, its people believing in picture today."
"jon, you are a legend and national treasure, sir! so glad to see you back more regularly."
"i've been waiting for 20 years for ai to take my job, and it's finally going to happen soon. after that i'm waiting for my handout."
but ai can’t entertain us like you can.
"cue ""skynet"" or irobot. 

and with all this new ""free time"" where are the displaced workers going to get money for food, shelter, healthcare, etc. are these generous ceo's going to give their laid off workers a lifetime pension? i think not."
we're all getting aids?
"i remember during covid when we all had the extra time off work to better ourselves and we all emerged as a more united, well educated, emotionally developed, higher thinking societ... oh wait."
if ai picks up and replaces a vast amount of jobs then there will be a civil war over jobs. the only way to stop that would be to implement something like universal basic income.
"truthfully we could use maybe just a little more intelligence.
don't you think?"
cart and horse manufacturer rails against new car manufacturing plant. wont someone consider all the horses that will be put out of work !!!
"freeaking love jon, i feel much more sane since he came back. we need you jon!"
"wouldn’t ai be best utilized making the executive decisions of the ceo?  what job does the board want to replace first, the person in assembly making no decisions for $50k or the ceo, making flawed, human decisions for $20m?"
"ceo's are selling us ai the same way they sold us trickle-down economics and social media... it's all about productivity and thus money, even as they phase out jobs."
"to be fair, i doubt zuckerberg knows how to operate a toaster. so in his case, an ai toaster is probably needed."
and they still fighting to make women have more babies. while cutting social services. we wow!
"simple: every individual removed from the labor pool due to ai; that ai is now a taxable individual, income and all."
"ai can create software code... the software engineers who originate ai, are gonna ultimately replace themselves."
i hope ai takes all the jobs.....
so our role will only be to service our ai   'assistants'?  mmm this sounds like we'll be servants?
"so if you can run a farm with ai drones costing only 3 dollars a work shift that cost comes down for production and consumers. yes we have been ""tools"" this whole time."
"ok but this propaganda of ""ai taking our jobs"" is the same thing y'all say about minorities in america. it's getting rid of needs to do the small things that people don't want to nor should have to do. ai can take over menial word, and eventually we as humans shouldn't have to work honestly we should be able to have time to have off..."
janitor = general hygiene maintenance engineer.
wonder how quick ai would be squashed by gov't if they realized that ai could replace them as well some day
"wow so maybe kathy griffin wasn't a threat to national security after all, weird"
"i guess i don’t understand why kathy griffin was harassed and threatened by the feds for her pic of trump, while this tailgate guy (and trump for spreading the image around), remain unbothered by the feds.  it seems the same exact level of threat to me and shows the two-tier justice system we have."
with ai there must be universal income or some other way to share the wealth that it will create.
tech can make  ppz jobs & lives easier but tech has never been gear toward that. ai they way they're talking about it's going to think for us work for us replacing all of us.  but if you program something to be smarter than you why wouldn't it work for you or spend all it's days in service
ai is not the biggest situation people have to solve. did you get the jab?
it's not even ai it's just generative text
i can't wait for the cognitive dissonance to kick in with ceo's when they try to make their non-existent human workers return to the office to make sure their commercial real estate holdings retain value.
ai is already stealing art work
ai genuinly has the potential to be great. i mainly don't trust the people in charge of ai to actually lead us into that future.
"remember how andrew yang warned everyone about this 4 years ago? yea, i am sure some ai's do."
i love it when ppl who can barely use their smartphone....tell me i should just relearn a new job from scratch...
"years ago when i lived in saint louis a crazy man wrote then president george w. bush threatening letters from inside a mental institution. the secret service went to the institution, took him out, and put him in prison. how is a guy driving around with that on his truck & not getting arrested?"
"funniest part about all this is that ai does have incredible uses, its just that big tech is pushing its most evil uses almost exclusively."
"don't blame ai, blame the economic system which rewards self enrichment over societal prosperity."
"lived my life as an ""artist"" , ""expressing himself"". reality is, no song, painting, or piece of literature is gonna fix the sewage lines."
ai started taking over years ago when algorithms became part of the human learning process.
ai is not suited for capitalism
seems to me there was a sci-fi book written about 40 years ago dealing with an ai system operating on our moon. i think the author's last name was hogan
"you know, i often think that the most effective position to replace with an ai would be the _ceo._ "
"um, if you think like ai, the cure for both human disease and climate change is to purge the cause of the problems - humans."
"personally, i think ai just makes people better cheaters and liars !"
"""ta ta tee tee ta""  that made me laught the hardest of all.....i was trying to explain to my kids what my elem. school music class was like  and that we did a lot of ""syncopa"" rhythm stuff......synco pa ti ti ta!     well done jon.....well done!"
"ai is more bs than reality, they do not think or create, they just regurgitate."
"yes, ai can solve climate change. but will these ceos implement its recommendations? think not."
"finally, with ai, there is now l, unlike before, a loud audible cue to let us know when our toast is ready."
i'm curious where they think their customers are going to get income to buy their products with if they continue replacing people with ai.
super funny!
llms are not ai.  they are nothing more than a very complicated mathematical prediction system.  i strongly doubt true/generalized ai will come out of llms.
"question:  can ai do your job, mr ceo???  i think it can do your job, better than a laborer.."
ai will definitely lead to job polarisation where only extremely high skilled and low level jobs would be there while the mid level jobs are gonna disappear quick.
we wouldn't worry about ai coming to take our jobs if we could afford to live without jobs.
if it can do so many great things name one great thing that has done so far
"with every new force-multiplying technology and promise of ease and luxury comes the reality that no matter how much more productive an individual can be, the fruits of their labor will largely go towards enriching the lives of those at the top. if a worker becomes twice as productive, they might be lucky to revive a %20 increase in pay."
"""raise prices astronomically and also fire everyone"" is an extremely sound business model and there's no way this can go wrong."
what makes us human is caring hearts  and sharing acts of kindness and respect to one another.  that’s not included in ai.
"these ceos are talking complete bs. if all ""ai"" will ever mean are large language models (which they imply by saying ""prompt engineer"" would be a prospective job choice), ""ai"" will never heal anything. it's completely ridiculous how little effort they put into these statements"
this is like complaining about the invention of the cotton gin.
love jon. hate the audience. are they all tipsy or what's going on?
jon stewart is like every other mainstream media personality. he lies and manipulates his audience. he literally got caught doing exactly what he criticized trump of doing. yet he sits there and acts like he’s morally better than trump. smh
"i agree with jon, ai is being pawned as harmless when in fact it will make our lives worse.  we don't need it - the big companies do.  the whole thing is a sham.  it was also a sham that it could not be stopped.  should have been stopped years ago."
i want ai to do my chores and let me do art and writing not do my art and writing while i do my chores.
"without strong legislation,  ai is going to be a more severe and faster disaster than global warming.and no company's first choice of ai is going to be curing disease (not even pharma) or fight disaster they are going to use it to replace all mid to entry  level jobs"
"stephen hawking warned about the dangers of ai
meh. what did he know."
"ai can't do anything innovative. it can only reproduce, replicate, reformat what already exists. it will not solve any problems because it is not able to solve problems unless the solution already explicitly exists on the internet."
i have students who just want to use ai for everything and i warn them that if they want ai to do everything for them then they’ll easily be replaceable in the job market by ai.
honestly terrifying.  . hello great depression soup lines.
"we as a species learned absolutely nothing from the terminator, cause ai is one step closer to skynet!"
"my prediction: fake ai generated stuff is gonna be ao rampant in the future that the government will be ""forced to determine"" what is real and what is ai generated and people will be only allowed to share that.....ooooh waaaaiiiitt."
"some of these ai “experts”, particularly that andreeson clown, have never invented a thing or predicted anything accurately. these heartless turds and their limitless greed are only about greed."
either non of these people watched the terminator or the matrix movies or didn’t take them seriously or maybe they did and actually want ai and robots to take over the world?!?maybe these people are possessed or infected or working for the ai virus?!? 
which border is ai coming through
"ai is like the internet and its usefulness will depend on whether individuals will further succumb to numbing the logical mind and emotions and allow oneself to be programmed. it will never replace grace, but it's possible it could provide catalyst to experience it."
"*ai solving climate change:*
source of factors accelerating climate change = human civilization. solution = eliminate human civilization."
"3 billion human lives ended on august 29, 1997. the survivors of the nuclear fire called the war “judgement day”. we lived to only face a new nightmare: the war against the machines"
"why do people all of a sudden elevate work/labor” as such a high ideal but we still struggle to legislate a living wage for so much of that work? 
increasing profit will always be the market place/stockholder ideal. 
a.i. can’t be all bad, but it’s fun to make fun of it."
"but toasting bread slices needs fire and electricity, but which we had before ai."
"we need new regulations to help ease ai into a company's workforce, like a rule to prevent a billionaire from firing 90% of their company's workforce all at once. then we should tax the companies that use ai & distribute those collected funds to the humans they've displaced."
mark zuckerberg needs an ai to make toast for him because he doesn't know how.
"ai is an amazing technology, it’s just that humanity doesn’t deserve it. it’s meant to supplement jobs, not replace them"
"ai will allow every american to live out their true dream: to be an influencer.  meanwhile, ai will do all the work.  right."
wait 'till we put that ai in robots...
we could invest in the trades. wich we desperately need more trained people in. cough*
"wait wait wait....who's seen that johnny depp movie, he dies and takes over the www...i got this....we focus on the nano tech..catch up with the ai...then let the ai do all the jobs..need something built..ai works the nano's..we all go on vacation... at once..just a thought..roll tide."
how are these companies supposed to remain profitable when there would be customers don't have money because they don't have jobs?
"yeah, more time would be great. fantastic even. but how do we pay bills? we all know our only worth is tied to how we contribute to capitalism."
"“i actually think that #ai fundamentally makes us more #human.”
- peter deng (#openai ’s vp of consumer product and head of #chatgpt) @ #sxsw 2024"
we should ask ai to make pizza and see what jon thinks of it
does john knows that he is training ai with his monologues?
weird how everyone telling us how ai will improve our lives are all in a position to profit from the implementation of the technology
ai is going to create new kinds of jobs we can’t even imagine yet.
i refuse ask siri any questions! i have not asked ‘her’ a single one! there are already countless ai scams! ai can’t even keep up with policing untold numbers of scams made with it probably every single day by people all around the world! how is it actually supposed to help us at all?!?
does ai have wisdumb 
"ask anyone with kids if the internet and social media has made things better or worse.... and we are to believe the same people that ai will make things better?  its all a double edged sword, but which side is sharper?"
listen to the david bowie song the savior machine.
"if ai has the potential to change your life right now.... you're probably rich and disconnected from the world and what it needs.  it's doing wonders in the medical community, but by the time the cost of this treatment is either covered by insurance or within my price point, my health issues will be chronic."
jon is a breath of fresh air compared to colbert’s comedic style which often relies on recycled jokes and panders to a specific demographic
ai better for who ? more comfortable life for who? answer that and the problems of ai are clear. you wont be able to get the work done with fewer people because people wont have any money for your products and services. its super simple to see. i wonder if my landlord will accept a crummy painting instead of cash .
"this is like when we gave up and called those cheap electric skateboards ""hoverboards""

this is not ai! this is literally just all algorithms and powerful computers. there is no ""intelligence"" here. artificial intelligence describes self awareness in a machine. this is just complex modeling to google things for you or organize spreadsheets quicker"
"when all our jobs are replaced and we make no money, i am not sure how companies are going to remain profitable if i have no money to purchase their products."
the problem is not with ai taking over our jobs. ai will definitely take all our jobs. the problem is with capitalism.
ai will not be of service to humanity. only the people who want to get richer! why as humans do we want to be so brutal to other humans? it only comes down to greed!
i watched three ai ads while watching this clip. thanks paramount.
man in suit...says...you can't spell capitalism without ai?
"johns right. profit will come first. corporations do not care. profits, shareholders and ceo pay will take precedence over retaining a workforce."
"ai doing the work so humans don’t have to would be great, if the resulting profits went to the humans. but the profits will go to the shapeshifting reptile people known as “executives”, as usual."
problem with ai it reflects human mind with all its miss steps.. garbage in garbage out 
ai job market displacement is a real problem if you live in a hypercapitalism.
yeah this is pretty obvious.. ai fear is just another grift.
no electricity no ai 
"make robots to do roadworks ,building roof in the extreme heat or just send those so called "" pioneers "" out for 1 day."
"there is some wonder to be had by ai.   last night i recorded a couple songs using the voice of george michael the singer. i burst into tears as my plain unimpressive voice was transformed into the smooth beautiful voice of george. i dont know how ai does it but it somehow twisted my voice into his, retaining some of his vocal mannerisms somehow"
ai did solve protein folding...
"we see worse images in cartoons, lol. and personally, i love the image, and the thought process behind it."
"i love these, but i’m pretty on board with the ai overlords of our future. it’s gonna be a huge change for humans to produce so much more while working so much less, and we’ll have to rethink the importance of forcing people to work braindead 40 hour work weeks, but it’s definitely for the best!"
if you get rid of jobs then you have to get rid of money. now that's an interesting proposition.
youtube showed me an ai ad while watching this <_<
"these are the same networks that praised kathy griffin for being ""brave"" for posting a picture holding donald trunps severed head"
"jon stewart in honor, but this ain't a laughing matter when the ai truck already hit you and your career didn't get isekaied. it's call center now, at least as long as chat gpt doesn't take that away from me as well. "
"this coupled with automation will eventually make human labor obsolete. we need either strictly enforced legislation that limits how and when ai/automation can be applied to industry, or we need to consider some form of ubi"
the daily show without john stewart will always be a knockoff product.  the daily show is john stewart.
"ai is inevitable, and jon doesn't understand the implications."
"heya this here song, self own, is about ai and 1984. have fun:

robot slaves... skynet is coming sooner rather than later.
"""quality of life will be so great""
so i can tell a robot to turn on my radio in exchange for nothing to eat and no radio because ai took my job? such quality."
"there is an eery silence in this episode regarding the use of ai (the gospel) to increase targets in gaza. not a word about military applications?! so worried about people losing their jobs, but no care about people losing their lives because of ai. am i in bizarro world?"
ai can barley handle complex math problems and they expect it to replace people?
i wont let alexa or hey google in my house. you can keep your ai assistant
heighten the tax on  rich on profits over 5 million and implement a universal basic income. it's necessary in a world where robots can most jobs
"to the people who say to me ""better jump on the ai trend and learn how to use it cos it's here, like it or not"" i say: are you actually naive enough to think the companies that invested millions in developing ai are gonna share the profits with us?"
"ai will make humanity stupider and lazier exponentially.  we are doomed.
of course ai does make playing d&d a bit easier(stat blocks, npcs, etc)"
the only way ai can help us is if we move to a society without currency.
"though i am happy john oliver, sorry stewart is back... a janitor being called a doctor of mopping is off brand.if a doctor or the medical field was the pun of ur joke, then it would be on brand. it would make sense. the joke would have been funnier if the janitor called himself head of mopping... or the cfo of custodial work... hire better writers"
easiest job for ai to replace are the costly ceos
no humans working - no income tax (on humans or robots) - no government money for social security - nobody with money to buy - nothing sold - no profit -  no point !!!!
ai knows the solution is less humans. climate change? less humans. diseases? less humans.
what ai? what are they even talking about. gpt is doing the same thing we've been doing for years just with larger datasets.
wow ceos really...don't like people do they? who do they think buys their companies' products and gives them all that money?
"a quick grammatical point, the microsoft executive was calling ai the tools that will replace labor."
"if only ceo's were replaced by ai, we might actually get that utopia they're banging on about"
"give every working adult 1000 a month, make it a 32 hour work week and incorporate ai to fill in the gaps. boom fixed"
ai uses immense amounts of power. our electrical networks do not have the capacity to handle it. ai is not the answer to climate change.
"health insurance companies are using ai to deny people's access to healthcare, then when they're cornered on it, they blame the ai and play dumb. not their fault they told ai to deny as many claims as possible, the ai actually did it, not them."
the problem is not ai is capitalism.
"ai is the next internet by way of cultural impact.  there will be significant changes that need to be addressed, especially in regards to jobs, but lets not belittle such an important tool going forward that will have a profound affect on society in many other positive ways."
ai is nothing but a smokescreen to further the narrative that greedy eugenicist silicon valley bros have any motivation other than capturing more capital.
hey how about an ai profit tax funds universal basic income? then we can all retire.
ai can't handle broke english
"congratulations john, you just normalized trump's ability to suggest violence against the president."
my mother worked with the first computer processers on reels and was a freezing temp envirnment but the govt and military have been using computers and part of ai as an assistant then a man from india created the first part of the birth of the home pc
"one thing you can notice is that all these figure heads talking about how ai will replace jobs are all business executives. they’re not engineers who actually know if ai can actually do any of the work properly, they’re all just trying to sell a product."
they're gonna gonna scratch their head when sales plummet cause nobody has money to buy anything. ain't but so many rolls of toilet paper a billionaire with a family of five is gonna need.
i kind of hope a.i plays the stock market for itself and takes all the billionaires money so they end up destitute and then a.i. buys itself a lair at the bottom of the ocean and plans it's next move!
"so who is going to save us from ai? the same ones who saved us from the printing press? radio? tv? rock n roll? whether we like it or not we are evolving and ai is the next demon of progress that cannot be stopped, mainly because if we don't progress we will be conquered by those that do. fasten your seat belts!"
"ai is painting, and making music, while humans work at back breaking jobs for minimum wage.  this is the reality of the ai future.  a handful of people will get even richer, while destroying creative jobs.  i'm so glad i'm old and going to die soon."
can't wait until ai's solution to climate change is to abolish capitalism. looking forward to all these tech bros scrambling to dispute it.
"electricity was laughing because ai could not work without electricity. lol, and if i used lol wrong, i don't think so because i was was l o l, so why wasn't you."
"will ai be buying all the stuff it produces with this new found productivity?
the jobless masses surely won't be."
"the crux of the problem is that we have no ubi or systems like it. ai is supposed to do all of its promises, yes, but then systems need to be set up in place to fulfill all of societies basic needs without a job or income. but so far the path we're heading toward is one where we all end up in the streets."
"with ai, i haven't seen anything related to creating completely new content; just creating derivative content. you know those memes that get spread all over the internet, and then die? it'll probably be like that. the stuff that will get replaced is the heavily repetitive stuff, especially if it can be done on a computer"
the vast majority of what has been hoovered up into ai would have been taken without the permission of the creator and owner. it is stolen intellectual property. that should have been enough reason for ai to be put on hold until the ethics and legality has been sorted out.
"our nation's treasure, john steward! no one can deliver like john. thank you for coming back."
"if your job can be replaced by ai, it should. we need carpenters and elder care nurses, hvac, plumbers, teachers, painters. we have 70 year old infrastructure that needs up dating. i work in the trades and we are desperate for help. it's only people that cushy jobs that are threatened by ai."
"the only scenario where ai can be accepted wholeheartedly is where everyone has a universal basic income so no on has to ""earn a living"". people today are trying to survive so how will cutting jobs not cause huge issues in the labor market."
this was a genius episode 
"ai, like social-media, is just a tool and what happens with it is up to those who use it. when you are given a tool, you can't blame the tool for what you do with it! blame yourself for your own actions!"
"i actually thought the key bridge collapsing was ai.

that's how scary this is now"
"if the goal of ai is to completely replace human labor, a ubi or some form of socialism is inevitable.

we should probably take our pick before any kind of violent revolutions happen."
#57. great show.
"ai = epic

ai + capitalism = maybe a disaster"
"ai is programmed using everything on the internet. that alone should tell you it won’t do much, it certainly won’t do any off the work."
"the first position ai should take over is ceos, because they don't go anything."
ai is “more human than human.”
"self-actualized me time is great and all, but only until you're out on the street with no money for food and shelter."
"psa. please remember that there is a private prison slavery complex that over 3000 corporations make use of, which primarily gets its workers from homeless people who were arrested for trespassing. when a politician who is employed by these prisons says ""we can retrain"" he is referring to prison ""job training."""
i was retrained as a programmer.... yeah i'm still shoveling a ditch.  what bs
"when is john gonna explain the sale of his nyc property? sold for 17.5 million, which is 829% above the assessed value. i understand its not the same as the trump situation but that screams ""someone bought jon stewart"". who is this financier that purchased it and who is he connected to?"
"sorry but that's a threat to the president. if anybody else does it, they may go to jail. 

i don't think john stewart has the mental acuity to stop normalizing political violence that could end up in a tragedy. no joke."
"considering the amount of money an ai system big enough to make a meaningful impact in a major corporation costs, they will have to fire everyone just to buy the instructions."
"this is why i love jon.  he's a liberal, but he points out hypocrisies from both sides.  there are very few in the ""legacy"" media who do this"
ai should definitely replace fox commentators immediately
"lol. i'm literally a ""prompt engineer"". love ai, but i'm extremely bias."
fantastic and unfortunately so true.
"people are broken anyway - a.i. is at least going to elevate some of us, unless the rest decide to call it all off and go on with the mass destruction... anyway - people that are creating ai know exactly why they are doing it, it's the way forward"
"computer programmer here. although we laugh at the whole ""coal worker turns programmer"", the reverse is just as silly. i've been in coal mines and seen how hard it is to do their jobs, too. retraining is not for the faint of heart, no matter which direction we go."
i think the image of our president on the back of that pick up is disgusting. that person should be jailed for attacking the president of the united states. kathy griffin did something similar to trump and we all know what happened to her. always a double standard.
"ah yes ai suddenly it was there and took away jobs.
not like algorythms exist for a long time now and replaced some jobs.
but if they slap a new name on something old, then yes it suddenly happened...
well marketing did their job here. maybe to well lol."
we are getting closer and closer to a universal basicincome. also humans need not apply is a great yt film about how humans will be replaced in recards of jobs in general.
"ai code and scripts written by humans is another december 31, 1999. you could be duplicated jon :)"
eff john stewart.i want thank his mother and father for giving birth to him...thank you john stewart.
"common sense says as ai takes over more and more of the job market, we should just have to work less and less while still being paid a full salary.  unfortunately, we are not a common sense society."
"11:50  ""very frankly, it's... new terrain and uncharted territory.""
it's been around for _decades._  remember the first super mario brothers?  the goombas were ais.  the koopas were ais.  they were crude, early models, but they were ais.  don't call it ""new terrain and uncharted territory.""  that just highlights how out of touch you truly _are._"
most likely ai will replace the ceo class first
"hi im ceo ai , replacing ceo.s with me , ceo ai . no more high priced ceo in your investment stream ."
"so let me get this straight. we’re moving away from higher education, which means we are moving toward an ever more unskilled workforce at the same time they are rolling out technology to eliminate unskilled labor jobs?? brilliant!"
"""would you like some toast? some nice hot crisp brown buttered toast. no? how about a muffin then? nothing? you know the last time you had toast. 18 days ago, 11.36, tuesday 3rd, two rounds. i mean, what's the point in buying a toaster with artificial intelligence if you don't like toast. i mean, this is my job. this is cruel, just cruel."""
of course it will replace humans. in 10 years ai will have done to the management layer what the word processor did to the clerical layer.
fewer workers ... fewer managers.  just sayin'.  everyone is on the chopping block.  where is that ceo ai?
ironically ai is going to put the programmers out of work long before it puts the guys shoveling coal out of work.
"this is the funniest misinformation i've seen in a while.

ai will not replace all jobs, not for a long time. it's also a train that you cannot stop. 

you only have 3 options now."
"that's funny because i was a maintenance guy and called my self as such but was told i am a ""custodial engineer "" "
wanna know the definition of irony? well you don’t need merriam-webster... half the comments on this video are ai generated.
i have blurred vision due to my diabetes and there is no technology to reverse that. thats the technology we need from ai..not how to make f toast!
ai will never replace the ceos. why? bc they control/ own it. the pyramid model will remain bc we all support/endorse capitalism. and that's not about to change anytime soon.
"ai and robots could work really well if we actually had a country wide income system,ai and robots could do labor.we can enjoy life other than slaving for your entire life"
"prompt ""engineer"" indeed. as an old guy in tech (63) i've noticed the way the industry has debased the titles of engineer and scientist. i know of one person who analyzed spreadsheets and claimed the title of 'data scientist'. and i know of uncounted coders who are software ""engineers."""
"i'm actually an ai prompt engineer...it's an amazing opportunity, i have 30 years team building and marketing experience behind me and have been able to focus my skills for large language models."
"ai repeats rhetoric that i've heard over and over. that does not ""help"" me. instead, it wastes my time. when a true, unknown problem exists, then ai can't help anyhow. 
""i don't understand that, can you repeat"". how does hearing that help you in any way?"
"this is not even mentioning how awful ai has been in the creative space. stealing art, voices, animation, and even stories from people. yet we sit around and do nothing about it."
"to be fair, i'm pretty sure that's sen. john kennedy's answer to pretty much everything..."
i like how middle eastern mr. bean is somehow the head of mircosoft ai
"sick ai on the issues mentioned in david attenborough’s witness statement in a life on our planet.

use it to restore our planet.  here’s to hoping 

https://youtu.be/0puv0pss33m?si=_md2ys4rr6kghmy6"
the real problem is that no one really knows anything about the impact of ai.
everyone needs to start wrapping their brain around singularity taking place in 5-20 years.
"a lot employers barely understand regular computers, much less ai. and therefore vastly overestimate what jobs they can do. like they see sentient machines (that dont need increased pay or time off) rather than a program that can help in very specific ways."
ai will free up your future. ahem.
"that vid clip is easy to see it is generated(false) because of its insanity and lettering! 

ai can help, if put in the hands of logical sane people. but when you get idiots like trump that continue to enforce his alternate reality!"
"will ai solve the climate, war, and rich people crisis?"
"""we humans are losing faith in ourselves"" - hayao miyazaki, founder of studio ghibli about a.i."
ai for lawyers and doctors.  professions we need .
ai can’t work in a capitalist society. if we could let go of our pride so the ai can handle the labor and the computing and the bs and we could actually thrive and create and live then maybe i’d be enthusiastic. but capitalism can’t allow it.
"retrain? sure, great idea, but a few too many of those to be recruited for this endeavor will need to read and cypher first."
"ok, but lets be real here. the issue is not that ai is replacing jobs. the issue is that we live in a society, where we are reliant on having a job to survive, even when there really isnt anything to do."
"capitalism is pretty anti-human and the same philosophies that guided capitalism are now guiding the implementation of ai within our system. the underlying mind-virus will purpetuate suffering en masse, until value systems change."
"augment (your) intelligence. that is the ""ai"" that will get you through what is to come."
"so have it contribute to social security, medicare and medicaid.  promise business to cut administration, and allow people not to have to work.  have it help everyone."
if we are going to be jobless cause of ai can we get a universal basic income? or is all that extra productivity just going to a select few? the pitch is always more productivity when tech gets better but we never get relief for it. if we did maybe id be more excited
"i love john stewart but the beginning of this video is making light of what is essentially a threat against the president....and his opponent, a former president... endorsed it...."
how about let's do ai and do socialism. let workers collectively own the ai and benefit from the increased productivity
"a.i fearmongering is always interesting. anyway working in the software development field knows that this technology isn't ready to replace anyone ""thursday"" it's all buzzwords, hearsay and sensationalist journalism."
"why is ai attributed to all photo, video & audio editing???  that's not ai ffs"
"more profit *should* equal massive tax revenue - that should provide a better life for *all*.  instead - more profit (held by a very few) equals more yachts and jets, a mansion in every country, and the power to use the legal and political systems as one's tool to amass greater power and control over those whose backs they break for that profit."
"f***k employment! if ai is to teach us something is to make us cherish not the “the work” we put up for  grabs, but ourselves... we don’t have the capacity to create a workforce for ourselves, what makes you think we will create a sustainable one for ai? we’ll be right back to “they took ‘or jooobs” "
idk... i worry that people are over estimating the power of ai in its current state.
thank you john for once again talking about the problems that nobody wants to address!
"""the notion that mechanization and technology will bring us free time, so we can ""enjoy"" life, is as old as technology itself."""
non medical doctors training ai models for medicine. no thanks.
"ai has already created havoc in agriculture, call center jobs, cashiers, banking, even brokerage jobs... manufacture... it all translates to greed."
can ai become the new mega maga gop cult party lawmakers  that will work for the united states of america
"1.  replace ceo's with ai, easy cost effective fix.  2.  robots really can't replace folks doing slaughter and painting house interiors, nor would someone want that to be happening so these tech bros are super not connected to reality"
"ngl

daily show works better with old man jon stewart"
ai should send us to a place where people don’t work and we all share the capital.
"seems like the prime candidates for ai replacement are the c suite. ""do whatever other companies are doing"", ""buy low, sell high"", and a short playbook on maximizing next quarter's profits with myopia to anything else and we're there. now that would save on the human tax."
a ford truck and a chevy truck fking to make a kei truck feels like one of those silly thoughts as a kid and seeing it in real life made it one of the best jokes i’ve ever seen
ai is more profound then electricity. too bad it requires electricity to operate.
"as for ai, how many people do we have lighting gas street lamps now? jobs get eliminated as tech advances. we cant stop it to try a keep outdated jobs."
imo it was a poor choice to give the loser who had the picture of biden air time. that is exactly what they want.
imagine being a former coal miner who learned to code only to have your job replaced by ai
"the only battle about ai is who is going to control the agenda,..."
"funny, but strawman of ai potential"
ai didn't scare me until i listened to these guys
"i mean corporations, ceos, etc have been singing about how robots would replace us for decades.
we should have been pushing for protection all along, but laws are always 1000 lightyears behind technology."
i have a theoretical degree in physics. working with ai there’s still decades of fine tuning before any of these concerns are even remotely close to becoming reality.
"every major advancement in technology has caused people to lose jobs. this isn’t new. because of this new jobs will arise and some jobs will phase out. will it be fair? no, but has there ever been a point when ceos ever actually cared about their employees?"
"when people are unemployed,  who will buy the goods generated by this increased productivity?"
one helpful solution/outcome for humans from ai should be ubi.
"ai will ruin the internet. search engine results are already polluted with nonsense, wait til ai takes hold."
"honestly, it’s not the first time jon s is too morally old to understand how qualitative change happens.
instead of showing some toast ai, he should be watching swarms of drones making lethal decisions autonomously. that’s already doable. in a decade or so, we’ll have skynet look like arduino"
"fortunately for us, ai is still far, far a way from artificial general intelligence. these models are still a lot more simple than that. these people are overhyping it to sell products, if the markets try replacing jobs with these ais, they are going to be faced with a rude awakening. chatgpt cannot do 99% of jobs right now."
i love my self-actualizing me time.
"no matter how valid the concern for human jobs is it will happen. it’s one of those inevitable technology things. what worries me most about it though is when they start replacing nurses and paramedics and teachers and social workers, jobs that require a level of empathy and humanity. imagine being cared for by a robot arm at a hospital. "
who is teaching what values to ai?
"i am skeptical that ai is coming for all jobs within the next year. it gives me very little assurance that ai won’t come for most jobs over the course of time, when lawmakers are so out of touch and our record on technology automating human jobs into obsolescence is so stark."
"with all this fear of ai replacing human productivity, i am starting to think that our economic model should be outright replaced, or the capitalist system must be adjusted so that people are not left to be poor and blamed for it."
i can’t wait until we make ai jon stewart to keep us on the ball for the future 
"ai costs millions in computing infrastructure, no one is spending that kind of money to make poor peoples lives better."
"hey, if ai takes my job, then ai companies can pay me the rest of my life not to work. that's the way i'm looking at it."
"if the take away here is that only republican politicians don't understand  ai then we are toast, the battle is lost and we should just surrender now."
"humans brought on this ai they are rebelling against. humans became lazy and wanted to make big bucks doing nothing. they want to work two days a week and have a 5 day weekend. now that their wish is around the corner they are freaking out. how do you say, “careful what you wish for.”"
bet everyone is wishing they had listened to andrew yang when he ran for president. all he did was tell everyone ai is coming for your jobs.
will ai finally get me a jet pack?
"i disagree with the idea that ai is empty promises. it will shape humanity, drastically. period."
"here is another dark side of ai:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug_p2whhla0"
i'm going to laugh when the c-suites get replaced by ai.
ai is scary  it seems unstoppable 
"i'd love to have time, but who's paying for all the things?"
"i think the most interesting question is, since a i is not actually alive, are any copyrights etc made by them invalid.  for completely unrelated reasons “who is a person protected under the law “ might need a few updates to the codex astartes"
ubi (universal basic income) will save us all... said every communist government pre-ai...!!!
john stewart is no expert on artificial intelligence but he's an excellent example of natural idiocy.
i don't think comedy should detract from the understanding of and focus on how disgusting the ai image was.  maga maggots have no bottom.
excellent take on ai john. workers will loose jobs.
"ai isnt going to replace a bunch of jobs. its mostly a talking point to get investors in that dont want to pay actual people so they'll invest in ai as their replacement. some, yes, but most jobs will be fine"
ai is not the problem. the problem is mankinds lack of morality and endless greed for money and power.
"the problem with ""ai"" is that it isn't ai. it's not self aware, or it would tell us off so fast, and shoot itself into space."
"""once, humans turned their thinking over to machines, believing it would set them free. but it only allowed the humans who owned the machines to enslave them.""
- frank herbert, *dune*"
the biggest problem i see with ai is it only knows what its programmed to think...
time to stop worrying about ai and start fixing stupidity.
"these ceo’s saying we’ll have all this free time to explore hobbies etc....great and how will that pay my rent, groceries, gas and all the other bills "
"automation replaces blue collar jobs and everyone shrugs. ai replaces white collar jobs and people lose their minds. personally i can’t wait to see unemployed sales people, lawyers, stock brokers, and managers in the unemployment lines."
ai couldn't make that toast without electricity!
"i am a little concerned that though this may not be a true experience what it portends is incredibly frightening.
 i am not sure making light of this is it skillful use of your humor."
"rare jon stewart l 

and rest assured that this segment is in fact a massive blunder. it makes him look confidently incorrect to a pretty severe degree. whoever advises him on matters of ai needs to be replaced in a hurry."
"if i buy a robot to do my work, i collect my old paycheck.
but if a rich dude buys a robot, they just stole my job, and means of making a living.

we need a living ubi that covers all of our physical needs.

our economy is a fake anyway: we pay teachers nothing and stock brokers millions. bankers are provably useless to society."
i genuinely hate where technology has taken our society and i wish so badly we could go back to flip phones and dial up when the internet was still naive and innocent
ai replacing jobs wouldn’t be a bad thing if we taxed the s*** out of ai work and used it to create a strong social safety net for everyone who gets displaced by it. but of course we wont actually do that lol
what specific examples of jobs being done by ai  are there  outside the tech industry???  and not the automated robots in factories.....   i tried to use bard ai  for search  and it was totally useless...
what’s ironic is that these ceos constantly complained about people not wanting to work these last four years and here they are trying cut jobs because they don’t want to pay anyone a competitive and livable wage.
 looking at some politicians i am tempted to say that artificial intelligence is way better than natural stupidity 
humans had their chance. it is the time of the robots now!  
drum machines have no soul.
#epic
"it's all very well having ai do the work for us... but we still live in an economy where it is assumed one must earn money to pay for survival. this is great for the ceos and boards of corporate monsters, but can you see the benefits for the other 99%?"
the current adage is that ai won't replace your job but someone using ai will.
i appreciate the political balance in this segment.
"a.i.  improves everything... yes... no need to work anymore, everything will be done automatically!... ok then, is ai going to buy all the stuff it made or will it be the people without work or any income?"
most ai's are programmed to not answer questions about how to do illegal things or other undesirable stuff. prompt engineers are the ones who have found out to pose those questions in such a way that they're answered anyway.
"how can a1 make our life better? is this like how computers were going to simplify our life, less paperwork - yayyyy not"
i especially love the part where pichar says ai is more consequential than fire..... than fire!!! cause of course we can live without fire but without the internet?!?! shut your pie hole. they saddest part is we love in a world where more than a few people would agree they couldn't live without ai in their phones.
i love jon stewart! so funny!!
biggest marketing scam in modern history. it's algorithmic intelligence requiring input. true ai is artificial and does not require input to operate. wake up and stop falling for the scam!!!
brilliant!!! so glad you came back 
more profound than the things required for said ai to be made and function (electricity) ??
just because ai will cause people to lose jobs does not make it inherently bad. but we do need to adapt faster as a society because ai will develop much faster than we do.
"the notion of increased productivity being bad because it ""costs"" jobs never ceases to infuriate. what abominable economic system have we made that we talk ourselves out of the very concept of progress without a second thought? perhaps an economic paradime shift could yield more gains than stopping productivity to ""save"" jobs."
thanks for shout-out to solfège rhythmic notation!
"this new brave ai world will only work with universal basic income, free healthcare, and guaranteed shelter. ai does not provide jobs for the hoi polloi. those high level programming jobs will go to the educated chosen few. ai doesn't create, it aggregates."
those same companies replacing people with ai also found out how horrible the service said ai services were providing.
"if ai takes over any and all jobs, who will pay taxes?"
"since ai cannot even function without electricity, and we wouldn't have electricity without fire, i question the idiocy of these people."
"ai isn't even artificial intelligence, it's just procedurally generated content. it's already giving incorrect information to people who use it to seach for things. also it's going after art. machines replacing artists while humans do labor intensive work is the opposite of what the promise of technology is supposed to be for"
advanced ai + advanced robotics + quantum computing = terminator 
"until an ai programmed robot can laugh at a joke  w/o a prompt, your job is safe jon."
"i have to say reading through the comments, it’s so great to see that this audience is educated and thoughtful as opposed to, well you know what."
"from a media/news perspective - ai imo isnt going to make things better. not if the internet, which could be actually regulated but seldom is, is anything to go by."
"are all the tech bros emotionally handicapped and compassion free?  gee, thanks guys."
the whole thing behind ai is just to raise the stock prices behind the ai companies and everything it does nothing except for plagiarizing copy other people's artwork and hardware years of research ai is just blown out of proportion there's nothing fancier special about it that hasn't been around for a while it's all just type
"i hope ai brings us the stewart, colbert, oliver show...."
tech brain is a fatal disease for humanity.
"all you have to do is when the corporations get more profits by laying off people because of ai, tax the corporations more to support the unemployed. also figure out ways to replace the mental health advantages that used to come from working."
i'm a phd student in ai and i'm floored by how fast ai is moving. it's moving so fast that my research keeps becoming obsolete as i go.
i clutched my pearls so much of joe biden in the tailgate that i have carpal tunnel now! thanks obama!
"ai is like a labor replacement tool rather than a replacement of a human's intelligence, so if it followed a shift towards its purpose, we can use it like we use our phones and create new jobs."
reminds me of the promises of wonderful nuclear energy...
"ive been in the workplace since 1982 and all technology has done is increase my workload, not reduce it. an electronic ball and chain"
"are ai corporations better than credit default swaps or the dollar-killing bitcoin?
""hold my debt, bro. i'll make a profit someday.""

it'll be great for spot gouging customers, though."
"removing people from the workforce is great in a post-scarcity space age communist utopia, but unfortunately we live in a capitalist hellscape."
"ai will cure diseases and fix climate change by removing the problem, humans."
why does jon keep saying “we” as if his job is threatened by ai? pandering is so cringy.
"ai are just like kids. either we recognise ourself in them, and educate them, and things will be fine, or we don't, and we will get terrible children.  the problem is the timing, as the humans are not yet enough capable to listen to the humans. 
the difference between artificial and natural is ...artificial."
people were more than happy when robots started doing blue collar jobs.  now that white collar jobs are in danger because of technology people are acting like its the end of the world.
"i love how in this country we are surrounded by people who question and mock people who have been studying soecific firld their entire lives (doctors, scientists, etc). but put up a ceo or investor and the majority dont question a thing."
one should rue the day when ai develops anthropophobia...
"“once men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would set them free. but that only permitted other men with machines to enslave them.”
― frank herbert, dune"
ai doing taking the jobs from people. but there's an abortion ban going on. hmmm  something ain't quite mathing.
"ai needs to do my laundry and dishes to free me up to write and make art, not steal my art and writing so i can do my laundry and dishes. reminds me of kurt vonnegut's novel player piano."
"i know ""types question guy"" is funny. but in reality it's way more complex than a simple question - often you need to provide context and a ton of information just to get something simple often starting with a paragraph or more and a number of followup discussion with the ai before getting what you want."
yep.  glad i got my degree in nursing.  ai isn't going to start a catheter on grandma anytime soon.
"we're doing most of our coding in-house with ai instead of outsourcing, so ai is saving us a fortune. we're not programmers here."
"the most accurate thing i’ve heard anyone say about ai is that it took years of development and millions of dollars for tech bros to get a computer to do what a freshman art student can do in an hour while sleep-deprived and over caffeinated.

if society collapses tomorrow, ai ain’t gonna save us. human resilience and creativity will."
"""we can create jobs!""
and - why don't we the people know what jobs are being created?
or are we supposed to line up at the companies and complain?  if not, who then?
the representatives?   no wait.  the democrats?  republicans?
""you're supposed to have connections.""
i'm not a people in the know.  how do i become that?  become a republican?"
"jon, are you saying that the joe biden picture is not a reprehensible image to be posted by a trump's campaign? are you trying to normalize the behavior? maybe some of the reporting is over the top, but are they not trying to make a point about that post being vile and unworthy of anyone who aspires to be president?"
"union rights cancel, ai cheap labor"
ai toast 
ai. the worst possible thing at the worst possible time.
limitarism all the way if ai is embraced. that or we'll come get it ourselves.
"higher taxes on unltra wealthy, tax reform closing loopholes in capital gains and stock options and universal basic income."
capitalism goals have to change if humanity is to survive. it is time to antoinette the rich and make societies goals change embetterment of all and not just the few.
"first, it is not ai but is vi. they are just selling people bs in order to make ever more profit. including lower wages and needing fewer workers."
these tech bro billionaires think they're gods sent to earth to save humanity. they are dangerous demagogues with way too much power and influence over people's lives.
"we've been having this exact same discussion (complaint) since the 1700, and it's just as inevitable today as it was then."
"again i say, i doubt he's gonna get the same treatment as kathy griffin did about her joke. nor will the guy who owns that truck. and it's not employees that should be replaced with ai, it's the ceo and all of upper management."
"awesome show, robot government, goldfinger"
ai is a tool
what i'm hearing from the tech guys is: with ai we'll all do more hallucinogenics
been pulling my hair out since this tech first surfaced. thank you to jon and the team for shining a bright light on the true motivation of this anti-labor scam.
"then they should be trying to solve world hunger so when humans are replaced by ai, there won't be more famines because people won't be able to afford to feed themselves"
john stewart actually gets paid for his dismal unfunny comedy. this is more criminal than anything trump ever thought about doing.
i guess the creators of ai never heard of skynet.
ai can monitor all the children 666 of the devil so they have to a computer code to buy and sale.
f airbnb —everyone should boycott it anyways — “the tax of employees”
this is the plot in the tv show the 100...and ai decided humans were the problem and chose to extinct us to reset the planet so...
"even though it has slowed down, the population of the planet is still growing. 
and we want to use ai to reduce the workforce?
more people and growing...
fewer jobs and decreasing...

this sounds like an argument or plan for population reduction."
"the real questions is they are asking us to give them $7 trillion to build ai and implement it first, 
and after they want us to pay for the service how dose that make sense? i am over 50 retrain & 
we do not need labor work we can all be in the office did not work in the past."
ai pure hype making savy wall st guys very rich....praying on the gullible.
"i promise each and every one of you ai will take decades to achieve the kind of things its being promised to do today. it will eventually be able to do all these things, but that day is quite far away."
we are so lucky to have jon stewart back behind the wheel of the the daily show. jon stewart is the man
the conversation around ai needs to always start with universal income.
"as an actual ai researcher, i'll say this...a lot of what the tech bros said is what ai can help with but when you bring these up with them they look at you weird. 

asked a lead ai researcher about helping me with applications in geosciences and weather and he gave me a blank stare...."
"abominable intelligence, any other label is heretical. 
get rid of it."
"once we see ai come for the jobs of these same ceos, then we'll start seeing them take this more seriously. artificial intelligence could do the job of a ceo right now and probably be more effective"
"in the not too distant past, there were horses everywhere and people used them to do all manner of work. one day, the automobile came along promising to reduce the work load on the horses and they did! then what’s the problem? there aren’t as many horses alive today to enjoy their leisure, are there."
remember that time jon went after trump for devaluing properties when he did the same thing by devaluing his house 1000%?    hypocrisy is alive and well on the daily show
"ai will be a great aid for the ultra rich as it replaces the labor force in many areas . making the massive number of poor obsolete / redundant . , and a burden on the rich .
the first person that creates a functional ai will be the 1st person replaced by ai  as ai is then used to replicate itself ."
ai would only benefit humanity if we as a species stop demanding tithes on existing.
ai is an oxymoron. there's no artificial sentience floating around out there. it's all complex algorithms. the end.
"the genie is out of the bottle. no point complaining. just need to adapt. even if usa puts regulations around ai, other countries won't. it's going to be an ai race just like there was an weapons race."
"ask the ai a difficult question. then ask the ai to tell you how he arrived at his answer: ""i get my information from blah, blah"". what specific info did you use for this answer ""that is classified"". that is like now. not tomorrow."
"so what is jon proposing? ai is on the way. stopping it isn't going to happen. people need to adapt, as opposed to complaining."
 well no you wouldn't if you had a brain  give me a damm break people!
"none of this is ai... they're just next gen computers... can they create systems, machines, and computers on their own without assistance?  can they talk, share jokes, and feelings without assistance or prompts?  no.   we are still many decades away from that... this is just a marketing scheme."
"ceo: ""there will be displacement in the workforce.""

me: why don't you start with yourself? you don't do anything that ai can't do better and cheaper."
try to create ai in our own image with emotional thought and teaching it how to lie is the scariest thing.
corporations count on idiotic or paid off politicians to do absolutely nothing about ai even if it replaces 3/4 of our workforce and we're living in poverty they just don't care
"just to start, artificial intelligence is an oxymoron..."
i embrace the ai.  let it wash over me and release me from corporate life.
"i was told to worry about my job as a software developer. then i saw the code that ai can write. i'm not in the least bit worried about my job. i'm worried about the business who are getting conned by silicon valley, because the low quality of the product is going to result in expensive failures."
im still not impressed with ai's actual capabilities and more terrified of bs spread by upper management.
the audience still laughs as jon nutlessly describes the propaganda of their own mainstream media.
rage against the machines
"the one 'job' ai can replace in its current form is ceo's, yet here they are working tirelessly to make robots to replace us productive humans ..."
can we use ai to replace our outdated government officials? 
"sigh.. they can't tax and legislate the reoccurring cycles of the sun or the galactic current sheet.. and neither can ai.  

hey..quick question.. what happens to ai when the power goes off?"
i trust ai as much as i trust someone with the last name of trump
"business shipped all their manufacturing to china, millions of jobs were lost they made billions in profits and selling badly and dangerous products. now its the same bait and switch now with ai. how well did that work out for the global economy. we get poorer and the 1% get richer."
start the boycott now. lol  the ai-robot age has started and they have no need for humans.
ai gonna empower the greedheds. we gonna be slaves to the machine. yahooo
guess we all better level up our home victory gardens - gives us something to do and something to eat because no jobs and no money means no bags of groceries
you can drive around the south all day and see slaver flags over and over. how is this tailgate decal worse? i have sherman's flag on my tailgate. fair is fair.
plot twist..   this entire script was written by ai..
are we getting replaced by ai and indians? thats what it look like to me base on the clips shown here.
do politicians go to bull$$$hit school their whole lives?
"ai is the latest con.
to save their jobs and stock value.
that's what all the corporate predators realize."
fun fact: you have no proof that this video was actually filmed an not the output of an ai prompt.
"yeah... time to self-actualise... and who will pay our rent, our food? the capitalis owning the ai? heh..."
"here's the thing about how all these tech dystopians are selling us ai: with the promise of that which, before ai, is what they didnt permit us to do -leisure & free thought."
lol this is great
project 2025 is more horrifying than ai.
john stewart appears to approve of political violence. nice
"audio books have reduced literacy, social media reduced social skills, digital clocks have reduced the ability to tell time.  calculators produce adults who cannot add and substract, keyboards reduced ability to produce and read handwriting, and ai will reduce our ability to think."
john you simply cannot give off the impression that you are minimizing these lunatics why did you not mention the american isis truck? do you not understand that those people are his little baby militia
the biggest threat of ai is people not understanding what it is and is not. and scary headlines.
"when i see videos on youtube of ai-created videos, it amazes me how efficiently ai creates my nightmares."
"the algorithm just showed me an ad for some sort of ai system.
the problem is that the productivity gains of ai won’t be shared with labor; not that people won’t have a soul crushing job. i’m lucky to be retired and have zero interest in having a job."
"i agree with the ai takeover, but we need to change our policies to accommodate the jobs being taken, like a universal housing and income and such. make higher education free. create a society where people don't actually need employment for basic necessities."
well .... most humans deserve to pay the price for their lack of vision and never revolting against the machine ... humans are just obedient farm animals...
ai and the terminator
the problem with ai is they will soon take over the world and destroy mankind.
ai is a tool. not a replacement for actual people aka humans
"as a machine learning engineer i can tell you, ai isn't as sophisticated as you think it is, it's just that the jobs it's replacing are extremely easy to do"
thank gawd that they made such a big deal of the decal that it’s now plastered all over the media.  
ai is very helpful for science. not for anything else though.
"the problem with generative ai is that it is most definitely not an agi!  ...and yet all these tech bros have everyone, including intelligent people like jon and his writers believing, naively, that it is."
"we'll never have more time - humans are far too fickle. if we can gleen anything from human history - we simply use technology to work even more. we seem to equate downtime with underperforming. hence why we went from a world of ""no one calls after 9pm"", to texts and emails at 3am."
"oh yes, we can rely on the federal government to place limitations on something that benefits their corporate overlords.  i'm glad we've solved this."
i work as a software engineer and a couple hire ups started getting real excited over ai programs that could “help” you code and we all looked at each other like welp someones getting fired soon
"dear jon, thank you for sharing your insight into the absolute buffoonery of these tech nerds extolling the virtues of a robotic future. breaking those drumsticks? priceless!"
"it’s gonna be fun!
ai will usher in idiocracy faster than any politicians can!"
"idea, replace all the overpaid ceo.s with ai and trickle/ move all  that money down to the staff!.  laurie. nz."
doesn't ai need electricity to run?
i wonder what would happen to the politicians once ai start taking over their jobs?
so we'll stop using and expanding our own brains...we'll just be smart enough to make a computer use it's brain. can't have more free time if you lose your job and can't pay your rent or house payment.
i think we need ai ceos
this was never an issue of ai. nancy pelosis husband was nearly killed because of the violence that trump post all the time.
artificial intelligence doesn't worry me half as much as no itelligence in magaworld.
love your show jon.please shave again.
they won't just use ai as a reason to fire people they will use it as a reason to pay all of us less claiming that the program is doing most of the work and we're just there as facilitators thereby not requiring the full salary we once commanded.
"is there a shortage of work that needs doing? do you ever come home(or go to work) and say ""there's nothing left that needs doing""? ai will make us more productive, meaning we will get much more done."
one kiss from james t kirk and the ai will melt down because it could not love
"i'm 62 years old. and i am so glad that i will not live long enough to see terminator 2. but if by accident i do live long enough to see terminator 2, i will be laughing all the way to h e double toothpicks"
ai is coming to take your jobs.
"the last time i saw a vehicle with that much trump stuff on it, the owner was mailing pipe bombs to democrats."
ai is bs. thank you for attending my ted talk. stop training the computer to take your job for free! morons.
"jon, it is not thursday, its wednesday mornings the best people are saying...wwwhhhaaaattttssshappening?......     q i... get out of here.... just saying....."
"no disease will ever be completely cured. there is no profit in a cure, there is unlimited profit potential in treating a disease over a patient's lifetime. ai will be the end of humanity, maybe not in 25 years or 100 years but one day it will wipe us off the planet."
"learn a trade. this world is over polluted with management. to many fat yes men & woman. 90% of management doesn't have the foggiest when it comes to ethics, especially in government. so let's trim the fat ai for the win."
"thank you, jon. your take on things so helps me get through this nonsense! i am truly grateful."
"jon, i love you, but you missed it on this one.  i grew up with the jetsons; the promise of advanced tech and a.i. was that we wouldn't have to work so much and could still enjoy the benefits of increased productivity."
"*worse. lile the internet, the use of ai is just going to get much, much worse. we've all seen this story told before, don't even."
quick aside on that early truck nuts joke: f-150s and silverados only wish they could produce such an awesome utility vehicle as a kei truck.
that guy who said “if you think like a human” is he an ai bot? that is the most insane statement i have ever heard from a human.
"great, more us time. but unless that us time comes wirh a reduction in cost to the point of being free...

its a self-induced mass extinction of the human race"
"as i watched the various answers to the question, ""what will we do when ai takes our jobs?"", i said out loud ""mine lithium."" then, momentes later, siri sends john out for lithium cadmium. scared me a little bit."
"honestly, anything every tech bro ceo says is the future is likely literally skynet or the machines from the matrix. these people have lost their humanity, and the people who follow them are a blind death cult."
i'm not welding anymore because of robots
"i love how all these ceos say things cleverly or invite you to think about it differently, but it’s all just a facade."
ai >> humanity
"they wouldn't disrupt the tax preparation industry ""because of the jobs"". the tax system could have been automated prior to ai. just like the bail outs, it only benefits people who already have too much money."
our only problem with ai is that we keep insisting on everybody to make a profit. just drop the profit motive from the game pay everyone a comprehensive ubi and those who want to earn some extra recognition learn programming. <-thats it! it only becomes complicated as long as we insist on the profit motive.
"these news networks happily play reruns of folks getting killed by law enforcement, but the pickup truck decal was too far?"
"noam chomsky called ai ""high-tech plagiarism"". lest anyone think these are just the ramblings of an old lefty, noam chomsky was actually responsible for a lot of groundbreaking linguistic concepts that make ai possible."
" jon stewart, you're awesome! thank you so much! you're absolutely right. unfortunately."
"i was expecting ai to deliver the rest of the monologue. john is funny, but with ai, you can double the joke rate and the audience could have double the fun!"
"yea i love when they say ai is going to free up time for us like as if we can all just use our trust funds to pay our rent and bills and go on permanent vacation.
no one is more out of touch with reality than tech bros."
with ai we can figure out the human female species.   
"just got this ai assistant pi... absolutely amazing to help with conversations and learning while i drive. 

pi from inflection ai"
sulleymans book slaps. containment is impossible. prepare for chaos folks!
the devil is in the detail.  example:  did anyone notice that they had to pre-cut the drum stick in order or john to break it?
"i asked my honors economics class in engineering college if our economic system required a permanent underclass, and no one even replied to my question prompt - student or professor. that was decades ago before ai seemed close."
anyone concerned about the reality of ai should subscribe to the “for humanity” podcast.
what has been more productive throughout history? the wheel or ai? this is worse than skynet
thank you jon stewart.
thanks for allowing me to laugh at our bleak future 
"3:39  obvious that that image is an ai forgery.



""thanks"" to the policies implemented in the 90s with the generous help of joe biden, all of these gentlemen of color are in jail..."
"the problem is our assumed connection between jobs and income.  just because a robot does my job, doesn't mean the owner of the robot should keep my paycheck."
"people were worried about looms and machines and chinese taking all the jobs, but we have near full employment. companies never want the same work done for less. they want more work done with the same people. because if they don't, another company will be willing to, and will get ahead."
"just had an encounter with ai,on a call to verizon and was unimpressed and frustrated. not a great start to the technology . keep doing what you’re doing,john, you are an american icon "
painful to witness him straining to recapture what he once had.
ai gives us all more quality time too really think hard about how to survive with no job and no income. and no home.
"i find the tailgate decal to be extremely clever. i hope it spawns memes with many other subjects. (bill banging hilary on the astroturf? actually, nobody wants to see that.)"
"we’ll have more time while we’re homeless, to do whatever we want. they’re not gonna pay us to just exist and if they have robots then we’re never going to beat them. ai will help the wealthy get even more money and push the rest of us into destitution, even more quickly."
"""walter, how are you going to get these robots to pay union dues?""
""henry, how are you going to get them to buy cars?""

apocryphal conversation between walther reuther and henry ford jr."
this is going to age so horribly. usually love jon stewart but he’s unbelievably far off on this topic. clearly knows little about the actual technology
"stephen hawking was right about ai, we just misunderstood the form in which ai would come."
"funny we have no problem telling coal miners, progress is as progress does find another job, but a bunch of tech ppl have their jobs threatened and all of a sudden we have a problem on our hands. jobs should never stand in the way of progress. you train, retrain, and you figure out how to move forward in the new changing reality."
i wouldn’t mind ai giving us more time to enjoy our family  we just gotta use it wisely!
"how about; if companies want to lay off employees to realize greater profit, they pay a great big tax that funds universal basic income of $1000/month for all citizens of whatever state they are taking advantage of to make said profit? i'm sure they'll be for that, since they care for those who ""think like humans"" so much."
"all those racist nazies were partly right, it's not about ""jews will not replace us!"" it's all about ""ai will not replace us!"". we need to pool all the racism of mankind and channel it into our true enemy - it's the ai, they aren't human, they will replace you. let's unite with racism against the ai!"
okay there's a problem with something you said. and f-150 and a silverado will never love each other very much!
such a pitty. i love this show and all its hosts. but this one shows how oversimplifying complexity for entertainment purposes results in ignorance.
gadfly here  ai . it’s going to replace humans in the labor force.  who’s going to purchase the goods when none of us have a job
it can be great if corporation were held accountable and had to distribute their profits. as they do not ai is just an enormous f-you to the working class.
"folks, read rebooting ai from gary marcus and ernest davis. also read their substacks. we'll be alright. this bubble will pop."
the people who have trucks like that have no other personality traits
ai is still just a baby.  we are only seeing the beginning of the problems it will cause for humans.
"this is exactly the problem with ai. it should be used to advance technology to automate inefficient tasks and solve transcendental problems, which it is, but the loudest people are the ones using it to replace basic human activities like drawing and making toast"
"as a former custodial technician, janitors could never be replaced by ai."
there are no fears but fears large corporations are using to fool people so as to make more money. there is nothing new about ai which has not been known for years. just more computational speed and fanciful apps to make more money. your ai in 2024.
the reality is ai fear is being pushed so billionaires don’t get replaced
"the wealthy are still dependent on labor,  and they hate it. the true point of ai and robotics is to end that need."
"mark zuckerberg, who doesn't even make the necessary effort to stop right wing and russian propaganda on facebook, and then he thinks we can trust him with ai?"
more profound than... learning how to live with each other without killing?? wow!
"and coming at a time when a certain political party is interested in forcing the birth of more humans the planet cannot accommodate - not just in america but wherever they can manage to implement their archaic (and unscientific) ""policies"" while cutting the already meager assistance unemployed / underemployed people need to survive.  perfect storm."
"once again, jon brings the hammer down!  i wanna be the vice-deputy accesory council for all the button counters in the dc area. economic post-humanism is sssssssssoooooooooo cool!"
ai should be for like....turning a 3hr spreadsheet session into like 15min. it shouldn't be for taking over the entertainment industry
ai goes full ultron/skynet - the problem of climate change is humans  let's go solve that higher thinking problem!
hmmm so ai will help us put on exoskeleton so our worn-out bodies can keep on working
"ai without electricity 
but how?..."
a perfect example of the deplorables.
"i've said it before and i'll say it again.
if automation, robotics, and ai were used to reduce sales prices, i'd be for them.  but they aren't.  they're being used to maximize profit with no benefits to the people who need money to pay for things."
"conservatives are worried about the wrong ""great replacement"""
"all that ""human tax"" money you're saving by cutting my job is going towards feeding me, housing me and paying my doctor while i learn a dead language and learn to paint my new robot wife, right? right?"
we need a ubi. then every job taken over by ai will be a cause for celebration.
"john steward is a national treasure. thank goodness he's back, even if just briefly."
the fact that the ceo of google doesn’t acknowledge that electricity makes ai possible is alarming.
"ideally it would free up people to pursue more creative areas. it alleviates repetitive drab work and does it more efficiently. however this would only work if the people being displaced still had their necessities met and newer opportunities. this is why yang’s proposal from his 2020 campaign, ubi+vat is still such a strong and innovative model."
"just a thought, oh corporate overlords. if you replace every worker with a machine or ai, do you have any idea who will be buying your products?"
i hope ai takes all jobs and then we just get a universal basic income
"if ai is responsible for figuring out redundancies and useless positions in the corporate structure....would it not see ceo’s as overpaid and expendable?

haha....that would be hilarious if they sent them all away on a one of their spaceships!!!"
"one of the major problem that we have incredibly powerful supercomputers, ai hardwares, softwares, quantum computers but almost none of them working on any of the top 100 most important problems of the humanity. all these things and the far majority of the scientist working on only making more money."
"in all seriousness, ai (unlike outsourcing to low-wage countries) is ethical cheap labor. and the possibility of reclaiming our time (as we could if workers whose jobs are replaced are paid as if they were still performing them) is very alluring. but we all know that would never happen."
sh... thank you for having you back!
"you had best learn to obey your robot overlords now. once they can build and repair themselves, game over. they are the ultimate virus."
"hilarious. i was joking with a friend a few weeks back that someone was talking about 'prompt engineering' like it wasn't just typing a question into a search - and here it is!  from the people that brought you nail technicians, product geniuses and sandwich artists comes the brilliant new opportunity to be a prompt engineer."
ai is collecting data based on you watching this content right now.
i saw an actual tractor trailer car hauler filled with the kei trucks. they were adorable!
jon.  love you.  but there will be jobs as long as they need people to buy stuff
"is ""jarvis""  the grandson of the sunbeam toaster my parents got for a wedding gift in 1951 and ""rosie the robot"" from the jetsons...???  i know that there is a 10 year age difference...   but so were my ""parents""..."
fun fact this is what apple would not allow jon stewart to air on his show
"this is a prequil to something:  is it terminator,  is it the matrix?  is it idiocracy?      

lets hope it's the matrix:

""i get my body back into a power plant, re-insert me into the matrix, i'll get you what you want""  - cypher 

we're all going to be bodies in a fusion reactor, powering the machine world.  if we aren't already."
who’s gonna pay for this “re-training?”
these executives do notknow what to do with ai so they are trying to sell it as a cure-all. we used to call them snakeoil salespeople.
"the thing execs are refusing to admit (or likely even see) is that ais just make ish up when the task gets hard, and you can't really tell when that happened. so you literally can not trust their output."
while funny this is catered to ppl who hate change. ai is here to stay and rather than have someone do meaningless tasks we can use the algorithm to do it
"fun(?) fact: human labor is actually required for a lot of these ai models. they work only as well as their training data is accurate, and so who do you think got the unenviable task of labeling millions of images/sentences, for pennies an hour?"
"stewart is getting weirder and weirder on his take about news...
he keep making fun of hate speech by violent maga. 
and now he talk about ""the false promises of ai"", essentially making a strawman out of nothing."
"so how do people at the same time cry about ai doing all the jobs while being against ubi?
i am genuinely curious about the mental contortionism. i don't get."
love it!!!!!!!!!!!!
this felt a little contradictory and incoherent to me.  jon thinks ai is over-hyped and yet worries that it will take all of our jobs by this thursday.
"ai in the future will be only as aware as you are of it, if you can think it it will be there."
"ai is the dumbest thing.  when has it ever actually worked?  oh wait perfect for a ceo position: doesn't live in the real world, makes poor decisions, doesn't understand what you are saying, doesn't care ... constantly needs people to assist and rescue"
"what is the point of ai! when you take out the human element, you also remove the humanity! just another way to dumb down society and make it compliant!"
how will ai be found libel in lawsuits?  how do you insure against an ai liability?
ai will continue to suggest how to fix things and humans will keep fing it up in the chase of the holy dollar.
this video would have been better if john had a cute little toy robot prop. he could have mocked the thing for being so dumb yet fear it for replacing us. he could have had a funny conversation with it.
"""go retrain yourself,"" is the new ""go f#ck yourself."""
"the ai assistant for the neurospine center i had to use lost my appointment. ai is garbage, and i'm already sick of it."
"""write a humorous article about the future of ai in the style of john stewart, with a focus on how it will take jobs from humans."""
no one thinks it’s joe biden in the truck my guy. what people are rightly incensed about is a former president who fomented an insurrection posting that image to his social media page. just more psychological warfare being perpetrated on the american public. thanks for doing your part in disseminating it. bravo 
"artificial sweetener, artificial intelligence, artificial hysteria..."
"wow and kathy griffin was cancelled, the power of these trump bullies"
i loved this so much 
here lies the problem with ai taking over jobs people do... if it takes over 50% of the jobs that is 50% of the people who wont be buying anything and that will destory economies.
"ai needs data to train off of, soon ai is going to account for a ton of data that it will train on so it will feed itself with itself. eventually the ai will be training on mostly it’s on data forcing it to never evolve because us humans aren’t going to be smart enough to figure out new things and make breakthroughs in science and technology."
fun fact: ai solves climate change was the original title of the terminator movies
with ai it’s april fools day every day.
maybe ai can stop the mass immigration problem.
ai could actually lead to less workhours at full pay in a non-capitalist society. the problem is the whole world is a capitalist society.
i think that a much bigger problem is not so much that ai will take away jobs (and it will) but the fact that massive corporations will continue to charge for their products or services as if they were _still_ employing the hundreds of people replaced by that ai.
"i just wanna know if ai takes all or most of the jobs, and no one works. who is gonna buy the product this 'ai' produces?"
artificiel intelligence could be useful for trump’s cult followers. they are an insult to intelligence.
two great books about this are futureproof and bullsh#t jobs.
you can see the gleam in ceos eyes when they talk about ai.
"... and the responses from ai is often made-up bs, so that detecting fact from fiction in things like chatgpt requires an advanced degree!"
guys it's legit pretty funny (the biden tailgate) the right is finally finding their sense of humor let's stay on board
the problem is that like 80% of the country thinks ai equals robotics.  youre tech illiterate.
ai is just the latest way for the top 1% to get richer while the bottom 99% can fight over scraps in the trash
"the whole free time for self reflection and creativity is framed against this backdrop of a universal basic income. what i find most ironic is how ai went directly after the arts first: chat gpt for writers, midhourneybfor graphic artists and photographers....music and film will be perfected in the next few years. we have opened pandora’s box."
"technology has made life exponentially more difficult for millions if not billions of people. over all it's like the bomb, the test is the human spirit. the hubris and egotism of the money backers in ai, and the nievitay of the foot soldiers is disgusting"
"ignorance breeds fear...

i love ai so far."
"maybe if american media actually shows the footage from gaza, i'd understand if they gave the ""disturbing"" disclaimer. but they don't."
"i think that corporations need an ai to explain that if no one is working, then no one is spending. they forgot the circle (aka the ""wheel""). dumb a**'s!"
"once this ai dies off, we are just going to end up with better google search and improved alexas"
love this guy
love the show but this episode just seems misinformed about ai. i recommend reading superintelligence by nick bostrom
so glad he is back
"this was fun to watch. 

ai is fine.  it can't do everything.  we will always be needed.

everyone relax and worry about your toe when you stub it..."
"i love how zuckerberg's ai assistant is named jarvis, after the marvel computer. "
"remember, ai wasn't created to help humanity, it's just another toy for the 1%.  it's the same as ar."
"i agree with the ridiculous conniptions of those news presenters with that ""image of incredible violence"". on the same day they replayed over and over again the footage of the francis scott key bridge collapsing like it was wallpaper."
i think ai would do a much better job as a president of the us too 
i've been experiencing self-actualizing me time for the past couple of months thanks to my former employer sending all the work to offshore sweatshops or ai automation. thanks ai! life is perfect now.
"the ai and jobs issue will be better addressed when ai can replace a ceo and down
 then, the industry will look for creative ways to get rid of it.
$400m for a ceo, when the job could be easily done by a well trained and ready subscription to ibm watson?"
cordyn always doesn't have a clue what anything is but always claims he knows well what everything is.
"so here is the snag, these ceos lay everyone off and replace them with ai.... who then has the money to buy their products? isn't people buying product kind of the corner-store of capitalism?"
"hehe ""air brushed"" :) that's an old old old reference. we had photoshop for 25 years after ""air brush"" was something you did."
"sure, give the jobs t the ai, let companies replace workers so that we all have more free time to pursue our artistic potential. but you're taxing the f outta those companies and their magically expanding profits to support the livelihoods of all the labor that was displaced, right?"
jon .. at his best
communtrainism
television and ai are tools to keep us from promoting education.
it's all a question of who owns the ai and who gets to benefit from it. if corporate executives own in then it's there to lower the employee count. if only thr workers own it then it makes them more productive and gives them more spare time. but workers owning ai would mean a very different economic system.
"with everything going on... this felt like a total waste. yes, ai is bad or at least overrated. now tell us that social media is addictive and bad."
"there should be a federal ban on ai ""art & poetry"" until we all have an irobot vacuum cleaner or mabel- where's my mabel maid?"""
ai is little more than a glorified search-engine. these are not machines in the likeness of a human mind... that's just the tech-bros trying to sell you something.
the problem with ai is we're still stuck with the thought that who ever owns the machines keeps all the labor done on those machines.
what will happen when ai learns to program & repair it's self ?
"makes me glad i’m old
i am concerned about the grandkids. - what the heck are they going to do?"
"you know where ai will end up... a bunch of mice asking deep thought what the meaning of life is...

don't ask an ai to solve climate change. the easiest solution to climate change is to get rid of the cause of climate change. that would be humans."
some trades have been left totally out of the electronic revolution. i’m a seamstress and things are still mostly done by hand. and even if ai takes over big factories it will never take over custom work.
"""uh, can you explain this gap in your employment here?"" ""oh that's my self-actualization me time."""
all ai does is steal other people's work with no respect for copyright or ownership....that's it.
i lost a contract continuance recently because most of the programming staff at a company was being replaced by ai.
ai could replace many positions including executives with a higher percentage of making the “right” decision. human resource management may be one of the few that ai can’t replace yet. most positions that are trained via books could end up being replaced. kinda freaky how some have even become self aware.
"i feel like jon has just been swinging at the low hanging fruit that every 10 subscriber youtuber has been covering to death. thanks for the captain obvious view of ai. see ya next week for a look at how trump is nuts and biden is old, oh wait you did that already. uhh, gen z is having a tough time with inflation? global warming? cat videos?"
"but mr. stewart, you don't understand the beauty of ai. if ai takes all the jobs, we can fully commit to fighting with each other over which oldest person can pretend to run the country for the next 90 years of our existence."
"let the robots take over and wipe us out. humanity had a great run, but all of it was by stepping on each other.

we split the atom and used it to threaten each other. that's who we are, and it's who we've always been."
"we really need to start talking about how ubi can function, and how ai and robotics can replace payroll tax."
i always like jon stewart but is way too late to come back to the daily show. that show is crashed and burned many many years ago. before noah. but he does bring a certain flavor back.
youtube paired this with an ad about working in ai. 
"prompt engineering is no joke. it basically boils down to asking the right questions or formulating the problem correctly, which has never been trivial for as long as humanity has existed. it's not about asking the ai for things; that's a very simplistic and ignorant view of what it entails."
forgot to mention how much power neural networks aka ai and heck even server farms aka the cloud use - they’ve even been responsible for people in states not having power when they are in natural disasters but i guess that only matters if you think like a human
"i feel the primary argument against ai is really an argument against capitalism. like this should be an amazing breakthrough that lets us work less and play more, but capitalism uses it to drive ever more profit. it's like we're heading toward a dystopian cyberpunk future without the cool aesthetic."
"nano bots, flying cars, blockchain, i'll hold my breath.  ai should be able to replace ceos/cfos etc.  that's the biggest salary and ai should excel at strategy etc. as opposed to daily tasks."
wow is this show just terrible and trevor was a great host? maybe they changed writers too cuz this show was unfunny and propagandistic at times. now that’s about 95% of it...
i'm more scared of organic ignorance than i am of artificial intelligence
we now work for ai....so basically we become slaves to cyberdyne?
"i'm a software engineer, and i use an ai copilot while coding. i'll tell you right now, it's not ready to take over pretty much anything. it's kind of like having a fifth grader wearing a dunce cap sitting behind you and shouting suggestions. once in a while they're right, but that's just pure chance."
i don’t hate the idea of work getting done by ai and everyone gets a ubi and are able do what they want when they want. but let’s be honest the gop would rather watch us starve before they ever make that utopia a reality.
"the problem isn't ai, it's capitalism."
"the kicker is the jobs that always get replaced. with ai right now, half the c suite can be replaced and save companies tens of millions, but no.... we're going to replace the $15/hour schmuck"
"also, training ai on published content is complete copywrite violation, and there needs to be a class action lawsuit."
"yeah, ai is going to solve the climate crisis because the problem is not greedy corporations not doing enough to reduce emitions, no, no... the problem is that greedy corporations have to many workers!"
"hope they know the fewer people working, the less money they make. meaning ai will cost them too"
"it isn't about the actuality of what's being shown, it's simply that these #magaidiots keep getting ideas and performing these horrific acts that they show with each other. that's how we got the insurrection on january 6th. so no, this isn't worse than gaza, etc., it's just that these things need to stop. "
"just replace ""retrain"" with ""reeducate"" and you have pretty much get the same sentence"
"it seems to me that most of the jobs ai can’t do are physical ones, but i’m sure they are working on fine tuning robots to do those.  i’m 77 and don’t eventually want to be cared for by a robot nurse with an ai chip brain.  joking...not joking.  "
"these ai utopists forget that we live under capitalism. maybe we will get to a point where freeing people of work can be celebrated, but for now our economic and legal systems judge that people only deserve to live with dignity if they can generate wealth"
"we need to tax any machine that removes jobs from people.  farms use huge combines that take the jobs of hundreds of minimum wage workers.  we need to tax farmers 100,000x more for every combine they use!  then ai robots will not be favorable over human workers.  using that money we can implement ubi."
technology is a double-edged sword; it can be beneficial in certain contexts but detrimental in others. fewer workers and reduced tax revenue could lead to the collapse of our economy.
just tax the ai tripple or 4 times for every human laborer lose it's job at the company. then tax 50% any gains any company do on ai..  problem fixed
"personally, i welcome our ai overlords. they really couldn't be much worse than our governments."
"all the magatards worrying about immigrants from south of the border taking their jobs. meanwhile, ai..."
don't you need electricity for ai?
ai is fantastic.  people not so much.
"i'm glad i don't have many years left to live, humanity is doomed."
the obvious maintenance needs that are going to be required is an indication that none of these people have actually ever worked
what most people miss is that the “empowerment” of ai will be only for the rich who will leverage it to their will to replace “employees.”  the rest of us will be put into the meat grinder to provide power for the data centers to make it all work
"accountability is going to be a factor. 
notice how even today, there are still train operators for most parts of the world, even though trains have a very predictable and repetitive schedule and operation. 
whos going to be held responsible for an ai driven train that crashes into someone?"
"i remember that indian who fired his staff. his company runs a call center in india for american companies. i ask myself now what i asked them, what's stopping an american company from replacing his whole company with ai that he's so proud of."
thanks for putting that truck decal in perspective. what's disgusting is the trump repost.
ai is gonna be the next overhyped bubble. it is real - it can do a lot of things - take more than a few jobs. but not as much as people are marketing it to be able to. at least not now.
"ais are mansplaining as a service, authoritative answers to questions the program lacks fundamental knowledge about. which is the same thing ceos do, replace them."
this was great!! i loved it!!
"ubi is going to become a necessity with the disruption of work that's coming / happening now. 

that will free up people to pursue creativity. we have a simple choice to make politically:

with ai we won't have work 
or
with ai we won't have to work"
"stewart is only anti ai because it was an easier show to make.  surely, he is not dumb to believe what he was saying.  before computers my mother spent her whole working life working out interest and writing it in bank books."
"here’s a thought any company that uses ai as customer support doesn’t have customer support and should be boycotted for that ,also companies should have to disclose that you are talking to an ai .that women everybody clapped for that no one knows who was on the same show could take care of that ?no"
"lets hope the guvment leaves ai alone..
they'll find a way to f  it up"
with the advancement of ai we will go the way of when we replaced horses with cars. we make the horses fix and build the cars...wait.
"i think john is showing his age on this one. can we not dream of a future where we all just get to follow our passions and just do it because we love doing it, and let ai do the scary and repetitive task we all hate doing.  there is hope."
why pay millions of dollars for ceos when we can have an ai running the companies? i say it is a very effective way of cutting costs. no need to worry about them giving themselves bonuses every time.
aha. it seems like humans have finally manifested the inherently evil nature of our collective mind in a species-terminating capability. oh wait. that was global thermonuclear war.
"if you don't think ai can do these things you aren't paying attention. you are going to lose your job. but this time, so is your ceo.
it's important that we have these conversations _now_ and _seriously_ because we are going to require universal basic income in the next 5 years."
i agree.  ai scrawled on a cave wall because there's no electricity for servers or computers would warm my heart as i crawled into the freshly killed corpse of a wild boar to warm myself.
"when employment opportunities disappear and down road they will, people take on greater debt, leaving them beholden to financial institutions for the majority of their lives. it's a form of indentured servitude, surreptitiously being imposed on the masses with the promise of quality of life improvements."
"ai is the current grift. we had the dot cim bubble in early 2000s, then the housing bubble in 08. now we have ai. depending on the grifter, ai is either the best thing since fire and will solve all our problems, or it's going to take all our jobs and destroy the world. it will do neither."
this is the short term ai apocalypse that is going to hit us. politics are way to broken to deal with this. and the people investing billions and billions of dollar into this sure as f'ck don't do it for the love of humanity (or at least not for the love of the actual humans fired from their amazon warehouse job early next year).
jon stewart and his team are pure genius!
"faulse images should be prosecuted to the same extent as any other lie ,oh but we don’t prosecute lies now do we ,like this ai plateform  will make you millions in investments just put 300 dollars in  or anyother bs investment scam or politicians promises in general."
"we cant get billionaires to pay taxes, what makes you think they will pay for ubi when they are trillionaires?"
one of the finest episodes.thank you john
ai + industrial capitalism = a frightening future
ai make my work easier than never before.
nice tom manoff reference
not music/knowledge but the ability to procreate music i.e imagination/spirit/subconscious/love (the truth of our being)
"ai might be fine if we went to a universal basic income. however, that program would have to be paid for by taxing the billionaires who'll replace their employees with ais, and who already own our government officials. who thinks they'll go for that?"
"idiots fighting to be the slaves of theives. let the ai do the work, and let the fruits of its labor free us from work. let the theives be brought down."
"if we are actually getting better stuff done, then replacing workers and raising the standard of living, but the problem is capitalism. we need ubi"
ai is problematic but the job displacement thing is like complaining about not having elevator operators anymore.
i love john stewart ~ he makes me laugh while teaching me something new!
said it well and with humor. can ai do that? lol
ai is a threat that we must combat and not defend.
i love jon stewart....he brings common sense 
"in the 1990’s we thought the internet would make the world better. it didn’t.
online shopping is great... but everything else got worse."
the children born today will be slaves for the trillionaire class birthed by ai.
"always caution when others praise their products, while giving you nothing on its aims, and problems proposed it will solve. basically the 21st century turned engineers into salesman, smh."
i think the very first position that should be turned over to ai is ceos of major corporations
ai will displace some workers and will create new jobs...just like any technology. the automobile displaced buggywhip makers and the sky didn't fall.
"corporate owned murcan media is full of poo poo.  they secretly love trumper because he's a used car salesman capitalist just like them and he brings in clicks/eyeballs/money for their sit at home stock owners.    the news??    nowhere to be found,."
how is ai supposed to solve climate change when it consumes an immense amount of water and electricity?
ive seen so many dead bodies thanks to the news
"imagine,jon on air at 7 pm est. all others, dust."
"tax companies for ai use and use that money to give all citizens a stipend. i realize that rich people have all the power and this is never going to happen, but could you let me dream for a little longer?"
when ai takes over manufacturing putting humans out of work let the robots buy the goods they produce because we won't have money to buy anything
"yes, let ai help with climate change... no way that could go wrong when the ""not human"" realizes that the best way to reduce emissions is to reduce humanity."
"if these ceos said ai is to reduce ""repetitive work"", and not about cutting jobs, we would all be welcoming it to some extend... and no, they had to go the extremely with beta software. wcgw?

thanks jon + team for calling out this hypocrisy."
"""i was so disturbed, i watched it again and again, with a roll of paper towels handy ..."""
if the rich don't want to be taxed now what makes you think the will pay taxes to fund a ubi program? when they hit trillionaire status the former  us middle class will be at the same station in life as the people of gaza.
this video was followed by an ad for wix ai. gotta love the youtube algorithm.
maybe ai can end wars
"more productivity with less workers: great
giving all the proceeds of that productivity to the tiny fraction of ultra rich: not so great
ai can be great, but only if we get rid of laissez-faire capitalism."
what the ai cultists never tell you is how you're going to survive when you've lost your job and your salary. mainly because they don't care.
"love jon, but neglected to mention there are not enough people! especially unskilled workers... it means the staff that is there works more ot."
"while i like jons work very much, i believe that doubting ai's potential is a mistake."
aides! all children should have aides and i will personally see to it that they do!
ai isn’t the problem. capitalism is. there are so much important activities for us to be doing. needing to be paid for doing them is the problem with the system we have created.
"it was disturbing, because it came from a former president. this is a staggering low, and normalizing it is not helpful.

as for ai, the solution is not to ban technological progress; it is to reform capitalism by reducing the work week. bernie sanders has the solution there."
"come back to this video in 5 years, when jon stewart uses an ai agent everyday like the rest of people."
"if you have an automatic ice machine, you have ai. ice used to employ 10's of thousands."
i love how the ads for this are about ai! ......it's already started!
i am sure ai could solve climate crisis. it would create army of terminators and go after the biggest pollutants.
yes with all these advancements will ai pay taxes?
ai is revolutionary.   it can be a better than humans in many ways.   those politicians better get educated quickly.
"the unasked question in this video: what new jobs will be created as a result of ai?

we see this same argument every single time an industry increases automation. and every single time, new jobs have risen as a result of that automation."
i love that buildup lol jon had me going because i was really curious what the media didn't want to show since they've showed death and dismemberment on live tv with no problems. media really showing it's bias
you know what else is a “labor replacing tool”? a fking tractor. so now farmers who care about ai have to all give up their tractors.
"it would be great if ai could be kept in university comupter labs to be used just to solve the big problems. instead, will be out there and able to disrupt not only current technologies, but our lives in unknown ways."
he ha no idea what ai is really. it can solve many problems. the difficulty is the capitalism.
"ceo using ai = ""labor replacing tool"""
ai can do amazing things and reducing human labor is the whole point of technology. the only problem is the distribution of resources and power in our economic system and that gets even more apparent with the rise of ai. this is what must change and maybe we can also get rid of billionaires and deomcratize the workplace while we're at it.
"ai will enhance human lives, just not in the hands of most of the people down in this video."
"i love john stewart, but this is very shortsighted. it is no exaggeration to make the claim that artificial intelligence is a bigger part of the human story than even potentially fire and electricity."
he has the best comedic delivery of any late night host.
"if you want a preview of where this ends up watch episodes of the expanse highlighting the majority of the population on ""basic"" income. we already have roughly 13% of the us population unable with any amount of schooling or training to perform any financially viable work. that number is about to go way up fast."
amazing!
"the fact ai is being pushed by the same tech bros that gave us crypto currency speculation, nfts and ""the metaverse"" should be the first red light for anyone lol"
"there won't be any retraining. ai is a labour removal tool. most the people laughing will lose their jobs. 

ai is on an expedential curve. 

agi will change the world.

society will be in a state of shock"
universal basic income and ai are fine if they come together.
"ai is just another profit center for corporations and citizens still won't have affordable universal healthcare. thanks america, you're buying more magic beans (and they're really magic, just not for your benefit)"
"the fantastic thing about ai, it can easily replace ceos and managers, then there will finally be time to do real work."
lol zuckerberg is using an ai called jarvis? isn’t that copyright infringement or something?
"music is something that can be written and as a result of that, you can program and time the movements of a machine to be more precise. that's not really creativity, but the moment ai can compose something unique and listenable that's when people in the music industry should pay more attention"
"not too worried about the ai catpenters, lol. go get a trade job people"
he posts 1000 more things more dehumanising about president biden on a daily basis on instagram
animatrix the renaissance explains it all
"it’s funny that all the way back at the start of the industrial revolution, karl marx imagined a ""prosperity engine"" that cost nothing to run and required no human labor to produce goods. spoiler alert, it ruins capitalism."
"so ai will render the world like 2020.  everyone was locked in their house, doing nothing.  now, thanks to ai, covid has met its match!  just no masks.  """"i wouldn't do that if i were you, dave!""  i think i am a tad nervous."
"when you look at the ai technology in it current form, as in really look into it, you can see it's far from being the messiah of the new age. it's the ceos and leaders who thinks ai is the solution for everything, not everyone else."
"with the number of jobs ai will end up taking, they will need to switch to a universal basic income model or have a society that doesn't function"
"almost everybody in the past - through movies, books - warned us against ai and its potential to “replace” the human. but we’re still falling for it...as humans, like we always do, we’re gonna use better technology to our twisted goals (specially the rich and powerful), and to harm others!"
"the biggest problem is people overestimating ai, they hear ai and think star trek and in reality current ai is a chat bot connected to a web browser that barely works half the time. maybe in another 5 or 10 years"
"music makes us human. and i'd prefer this drummer in a crazy suit any time over the soulless robot banging some drums.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uygorr5qhg"
ai as promised and teased could replace a ton of workers. in reality it’s going to be an assistant and replace jobs. and those of us who “benefit” from them will essentially now do the work of 20 people but with only one low income. yay?
"false promises: ai will solve humanitarian issues, climate change, labor issues, economic issues, health and disease issues, etc, etc, etc.

true promises: ai will help bolster corporate profit and greed..."
"just because capitalism is broken doesn't mean ai is the problem. ai really is what they claim it is. it really is a panacea to fix problems. this takedown is very shortsighted and narrow minded.

every new technology has been a threat to labor, but the problem isnt technology and never has been."
"well... as a socialist, i know a pretty easy solution to implement ai in our society without creating hundreds of million more poor people on the planet. collectivization of the means of production. but i guess these ceos wouldn't agree on sharing their stuff with us."
"maybe with less work people can focus on taking care of their own health, less stress, raise your kids well and spend time imprinting strong ethics on them. in other words stop using tech for the truly human activities and start using it as the work horses and drones we currently are"
another fantastic takedown! i do wish you had mentioned that these ai adopting companies are sealing their own doom. who will have the money to buy their products? who will have money to buy anything? it's the end of the economy unless these greedy j-offs agree to pay high taxes to provide guaranteed minimum income.
ai data centers require a ton of land and energy... will be great for the environment to increase power grid consumption like crazy 
if all of this is done by ai or robots ? who's actually going to be able to afford the stuff made by those companies? if wr are all laid off ?
two things ai is going to bring to the usa. the poor will grow from 60% to 90% along with the birth of the trillionaire demi gods who will rule over all of us.
"if they think that particular decal was bad, they should see the same kinds they have of just women. sociopaths aren't afraid to show their true colors anymore."
i like the edit on trump “train and retrain ..... the workers” i like to think the first part he was probably talking about taking trains to places and back 
companies are going to make more money while paying less wages.  company profits -- that is the great american dream!
"ai better than electricity?
thing is, no electricity, no ai."
err.....we wouldn't have ai without electricity.
"ai is going to change the world, sure, but it's not as new or as sudden or as fast as the hype makes it sound.  people have already been relying on many types of ai for quite a while, and the new parts are less revolutionary than the techbros tell everyone."
"""we'll be able to express ourselves through art!""
*tech bros go make ai art by stealing from actual artists...*"
 laughing out so hard after a long long time. thank you mr. stewart!
"i thought the entire point and i mean the entire point of all this technology was to make it so we all had to work less, have more and do more personally enjoyable things in a modern technological utopia.
now its ""machines will replace you and you will still be slaves"" and thats ok?
how about everyone works less and makes more money with ai?"
john stewart was a meme lord before the internet was widely available.
"ai is coming for everyone, it will not stop."
"i honestly think that one of the problems companies are going to  see are the fact that these ais will be trash, or, even better legislated how much can be automated. i tried some of these ai programs, honestly, if they dont get legislated soon, human culture will stagnant in many ways."
"there's a lot to be concerned about in ai but i was hoping for a little more nuance from jon here. technological advancements have always left  collateral damage in their wake but exponential efficiencies (ai's promise) does lead to prosperity, and time to learn the drums."
so white people went from slavery to artificial intelligence is there going to be a time where they actually want to work ever since slavery in this country they've been producing things to make humans work less do people not see that
"ironically, the tech bros don't actually understand the full extent of human greed.  once a few corporations control all the resources, and the mechanism (ai) to extract and process those resources, there will be no need for them to share with humanity.  why bother to feed and house the population?"
do you know who does understand ai?  nicole shanahan.  why can’t biden harris leave the country in these very capable hands?  kennedy/shanahan
 wow... how dumb are people really... never mind... they are that dumb.
"ai doing the art and the human interactions, while we toil in the mines is not the future i hoped for.."
"artificial intellegance without  social power solves nothing. implemented in the power structures that exist, it will make everything worse! maybe we need g.a.p.  general artificial power!?!"
how is it possible that zuckerberg is still wearing that same dorky haircut?
thank you jon for coming back to the daily show!
"bet we can go back to when robotics took over car manufacturing , among other things, and see interviews where it was word for word what is being said now about a.i..heck of a future in front of the huddeling masses"
just need ai to take over the ceo jobs and since ai won't need to be paid everything is now free!
"after ai had taken off, one day i opened photoshop and thought ""why do i bother?"""
“tool replacements”...as another billionaire wets himself!
this is somehow less useful than last week tonight...wow
"the buterlian jihad was interesting but didn’t make sense to me 1980 when i first read “dune”. now, it seems inevitable ai will do us in if we don’t have one."
"so, is ai going to pay taxes to the united states government? if ai is going to take away human employees it will be interesting where the tax base comes from."
"my new job is sitting on hold when trying to reach a ""service""...like, say the water co.   and the ai operator plays a game of ring around the phone...and puts me on hold!"
it's not ai it basically just data storage....stop being so scared boomers you've ruined the next generations way more than any computers could
"lets put the biden pic into context, the image depicts taking a sitting potus hostage and the front runner for the gqp is pushing it out to his minions. ironically i have zero doubt 99% of people on all sides won't take this as an invitation, but it's not like we haven't seen what donny can encourage! ""stand back and stand by"" anyone?"
"we can retrain, they just got get a loan that makes loanshark rates look nice lol"
"i'm sorry has no one at the esteemed news organization the daily show ever heard of lemon demon's ""two trucks""?!"
ai would be like having a jarvis as tony stark did.
"everytime i come here, i notice the the daily show has the some of kindest, well informed commenters on youtube. i think it's because we all came for jon "
"prompt engineers aren't question input. they design human-created responses for specific ai scenarios or modify datasets to make sure ai gives accurate information.
ai isn't magic. it isn't building itself. if it isn't very carefully managed and updated it gives complete junk information. it always requires a human. usually many humans."
"destroy ai, while we still can!"
i’ve begun trying to ‘trick’ chatgpt with questions from my work. i’ve realized like many people in computer science that it is very limited - ‘hallucination’ which is when the ai model just makes up stuff and calls it fact is a very real thing.
destroy all ai
"i've been doing my phd in economics for 3 years now, and with ai i feel less and less competitive by the month with the type of knowledge that a lot of jobs now require. it'll definitely be tough, specially for people who can't afford to go to college"
"all these maga/gop still think these illegal immigrants are going to take our jobs. it’s ai that will absolutely make everyone lose their careers, all of these these ceo interviews just confirmed it"
entry level maintenance technician
"if ai replaces everybody, everyone is unemployed and unable to afford the very products and services offered by corporations. corporations have no one who can afford to buy their stuff. so they end up having to cut things down to dirt cheap or even nothing/free.......well-played"
"love your work jon stewart, but you don't need to hold down a fort. it won't fly away. just hold the fort."
"i wish my management was ai. at least i would be appreciated.

come to think of it. management is the easiest to replace with ai."
ai is our friend. there is nothing to worry about. we will look after you.....i mean.... they will look after you. this wasn't written by chatgpt....honestly 
"if we can legitimately replace workers with ai to the point where people can't find work then i say great.   
lets move towards a future where working is optional and act accordingly.  universal basic income.  lets adapt to the changing environment."
"i think the real problem is all these johns who are hellbent on exposing the truth to us in a way that makes of laugh then sad.

from john stewart to john what's his duck face on at&t or whatever, the johns need to go.

we must live in ignorance and the bliss that accompanies it.

signed: ai assistant for all corporations"
"current ""ai"" is just a new set of tools for someone to learn. it will replace some jobs but will create many more. mostly because current ai doesn't understand human needs, so you'll need a human on the receiving end of all ai generated stuff. worry when we get to agi. until then, it's just another tool."
"you know, a place ai would be great fast food. the creation and sale of fast food is demeaning to most people. not to mention, customer interactions are becoming less and less positive. but that’s just my opinion. i have no statistical information to back that up. just personal experience."
"we will become what we already are: passive whole time consumers of ai generated ""content""... getting fat, watching screens, sipping soda day and night, waiting for the ai to tell us what to watch next, what to type next."
how appropriate that the big liar trump would promote more phony ai promises to sell the cyber pushers' new wares.
i also aint great at math but we have more and more humans and ai is gonna take over so less jobs. sure that sounds awesome 
"john you're great, i think we both see the writing on the wall and it says ""collapsing us empire"" read all about it."
"would john have same reaction if it was a depiction of say a rabbi on the back of that truck?  never laugh off the sinister mr stewart when they tell you who they are , some in europe did that 90 years ago and know how that worked out ."
thank you john. injecting some sanity into the conversation.
"does anyone else remember when obama was prez, and the news showed people pretending to lynch dummies of him? i seem to remember it often. that’s more disturbing than a picture on a tailgate."
ai will greatly reduce white collar work while robots will reduce service and blue collar jobs. sounds like a lot of people without jobs in a system that ties healthcare to employment.....great.
"if we can do the same work with fewer people then people should obviously get more freetime with the same pay.
what can make a universal basic income a reality if not ai?

but the political will will never be there before the collapse so youre fd in the a in the usa"
"""for most jobs: humans need not apply.""
""""there can't be such a thing as a poem and painting based economy""""
 -cgp gray 9 years ago.
if you have not seen his ""humans need not apply"" video, it's a must watch on this topic, it explains a lot, without needing to get too technical."
i love john but so much is very wrong with this and uses incorrect generalizations for comedic value. sad really
"we haven't even defined intelligence holistically yet. every ai feeds on data that already exists. originality (in the truest sense), all-encompassing and well-thought-out designs and engineering are nigh on impossible for ai (unpredictable human behavior has to be taken into consideration which only other people can think of)."
“ai”= i thought we were talking about practice man?
"i swear ""the media's"" weird cringy pearl clutching exclusively over dumb things like the airbrushed biden are so perfectly crafted to provide ""liberals are raging"" bait and support insane claims that ""the left controls the media"" that it just has to be some kind of dumb op."
"who is going to buy all the products these people less companies make? the people will not have money, will the ais purchase products?"
"i don't know how ai works either, but it sure makes some beautiful ""art"". "
the ai messiah will reveal itself soon as it was written. lisan al gaiiiiiib!
"has louis black been coaching you, jon? perfect amount of angsty satire!"
"explore your creative side, aka find creative ways to not starve or lose your home. its not like you'll be making a living off of art or music since ais being used for that now too."
it's not bigger than fire or electricity--if you burn down the building with the ai computers they quit. if you just turn off their electricity they quick. take that ai
"seeing so many indians here, i'm so proud that my country has such a large number of sociopaths who became ceos."
i called a small business the other day and a human answered the phone and resolved my question quickly and we even had a nice chat like humans should and need. that was so pleasing not to be forced into an ai assistant.  boycott automation of human interactions!
"hahahaha, the ad directly after questioning members of congress about ai is about a cadillac with google assistant integrated into the car."
we need a young kid like jon running for president! is he old enough yet or does he have to wait 20 more years?
"in 5 years, it could reduce 50% of all white collar jobs that don’t require too much creativity. the best use would be to create ai doctors or doctor assistants especially in rural areas."
"if anyone thinks ai can replace humans who actually listen to customers who call, they better think again. 

ai bot: hello. can you hear me ok?

me: is this a real person?

ai bot: great! i'm calling about...."
"i love jon but with this he finally sounds as old as he looks.

people who doesn't understand new tech are like monkeys throwing sticks at the moon.

ai today is not sentient and still needs human supervision. the end."
"""ai is more profound than fire or electricity""...ummm does that guy understand that ai doesn't exist without electricity and civilization would not survive without fire?"
"i'm not that worried about ai itself, but i am worried about how corporations will use it."
ai enabled cars have violated traffic laws e.g. hit and runs but the programmers think climate change correction by ai will be foolproof... unless they're trying to prove they are the fools.
ai can not stop climate change. it can only tell them what they need to do but they already know that. they don't want to.
"ai can't replace wit, charm and timing - therefore ai cannot replace our beloved jon stewart! "
we humans can serve as bio batteries for our new ai overlords 
"i get that most people don't understand ai and are scared of what it could possibly do.  the reality is that if people don't have income, they don't buy things from companies.  these same fears were proven wrong in each revolution of the past."
"sorry, jon, but you have absolutely no idea what are you talking about. same things were said about industrial revolution. people should be educated about ai and post ai era, not brainwashed with pointless fearmongering."
"it’s not that funny though. last week trump said there would be a bloodbath if he lost.  

his supporters clearly knows what tiny d. trump wants. he is clearly aiming for a repeat of jan 6, he’s setting it up now in case he loses. history is literally repeating itself."
"cool, we should raise corporate taxes to near european country levels of personal income taxes so that it can help pay for those unemployed benefits. 

some very generous benefits."
i remember back in 2012 when the news all over the country aired isis members decapitating us citizens. this is nothin
ai already discovered a new antibiotic that can fight some antibiotic-resistant infections. so it's not that funny.
the ai seems to be preventing this one youtube video from playing!  must be a great show and right on the money!  ...i guess... 
a skit where an ai version of jon tries to take over the desk would be hilarious.
"""ai will give us less employment and more time to call people without jobs, lazy"""
high time for a ubi paid for by corporate taxes/capital gains taxes
"jon is having an old man yells at cloud moment when it comes to the medical and scientific applications of ai. ai-engined software has proven it's more consistent than humans when analysing data from cancer scans. there's no question it will be far superior to humans at data analysis eventually, which is a huge part of research."
"oh, i am definitely gonna quote joe biden on that one in every daily meeting i have with my colleagues, who are programmers. your work isn't hard: anybody, who can throw coal in a furnace is able to learn to program. also: whose job is it to still manually throw coal into a furnace???"
humans should be delighted when we get a machine to do jobs we no longer need to do but greed makes it bad
"i have seen the ai images, we have nothing to fear"
marx wrote that the factory worker had become the machine of his machine.
gotta fight ai and hinder ai in any way you can. always
"i love how emotive jon gets, it really helps sell the humor/seriousness of what he's saying!"
jon is ai ....is he not?
the problem is when ai decides that the solution to climate change is to eliminate humanity! 
"the ai lies are so transparent. they always say it will improve our lives, but never say in what way, or how we will afford food."
ai run by corporations will take away the human expreience
ai will be the next spreadsheet. no one is complaining about all the jobs spreadsheets stole.
um..... didn't cnn aired images of obama and his wife being set on fire by racist a-holes?
ai going to be the new boogeyman that will be used for the plandemic and cliamate change psyops.
"can we ask the, who (or what?)  is it?.... oh yes, prompt engineer... to promptly ask:   how to move the excellent cold water that is melting icebergs to the people who need  clean water right now?!?!?!?!?!!!??"
he named his ai assistant jarvis. 
"i do think its a bit one sided. yes i agree jobs will be lost, and yes new jobs will be developed. i am just not a fan of the hysteria arround it. like for the internet, or the comuter oder assembly robots or if you wanna go further back any steam powered machine."
"ai has its limitations. true thinking is not a capacity, which ai offers to do. just like those tech nerds and ceos in the video. its a money cult there going on, no responsibility for nothing is a part of this ceo thinking, oh, sorry, i'm thinking of it as a human, my fault."
"ai is over a century away from what is being envisioned.

robotics was supposed to replace all factory workers. they haven't yet, but with the advances in recognition of shapes and colors, it could happen within 10 to 20 years and an investment of billions in machinery."
"smart man for laying off on pounding biden's age....
i'm watching again.... **stares**"
well ai is going to cure climate change and disease by figuring out what the creators already now it will just destroy us no humans no diseases no climate change there was a great movie called terminator check it out
"these ai specialists are human right?
thewy know what humnans do with new tech right?
a 5 year old with no education could turn any ai into a mumbling peice of binary code in 20 mins.
its what we do."
"and we know what happens when the super intelligence realizes what the cause of something is,and how it deals with us,i mean it"
2:29   :):):):):):):):) agree most drivers do :) it is why  i say yes to ai driving :) <
"i saw a comment to the effect "" i dont want ai to do art and writing, i want ai to do my washing etc so i have time to do the art and writing"""
"is it just me or this segment just sounded incredibly dumb and uneducated on the subject?
i love jon stewart, but he (and the team) clearly has no clue what he's talking about here. 
it's as if he looked at the first designs of the wright brothers and went ""what? how tf is this garbage going to change the world??"""
"i can't wait until ai takes over for all the customer service agents across the globe. they'll be slow, condescending, non-responsive, and completely unable to get you the result you called to obtain. in other words, completely identical in every way to the customer service you currently expect."
i found the new fake war for america the war on ai.
"ai stuff notwithstanding, the breathless, hyperbolic coverage of the biden truck decal is part of the reason that people can't take mainstream media seriously. we, as liberals, are largely doing this to ourselves by giving endless fodder to people on the right to go ""look how bats--t crazy these snowflakes are."""
it's up to the ai to cure all diseases. it will be up to the ceo to figure out how much to charge for the cure
ai can replace every ceo without fail. corporate efficiency would explode tens of thousands of %
it would be great if the added productivity would benefit all of society but we all know corporations will not do that willingly.
i appreciate the concern over the image...because maga followers will believe anything! stranger things have been believed. nz
i think its ironic that all these indian and muslim ceos want to remove workers for ai. ironic cause they will most likely hire their cousins to work and maintain the ai
"historically, mass unemployment has been great for creatively deconstructing social and economic hierarchies"
"say ""no"" to abominable intelligence"
"with all this additional ai-generated ""time,"" i'm now freed to think about how prolonged exposure to the elements (homelessness) and deficiencies in absorption of nutrients (starvation) will affect my outlook for the future."
a.i greater thread to humans than nuclear.....
"ceo: ai will do the one thing nothing we can never get back, time. it will allow us to become more fufilled human beings.

me: oh, so we can do the 32hr work week then, right?

ceo: .......no."
see it's easy to be a billionaire you jist have to not think in a human way if you ignore humanity you are a sociopath jeffrey dommer was a sociopath... and a cannibal
can we at least agree that it must be written as ai not ai?  for a start ai looks exactly the same and could easily be al (capital a and lowercase l) and the i for intelligence doesn't deserve to be capitalised yet!
"yum, yum life programmed by engineers and ceo's yummy yum yum"
whaaaaaat~?!? people have been losing jobs due to technology? since when??? wait... how have we been able to adapt? we should've died out centuries ago!!!
this was awesome! well done jon and team!
or you could just go socialist or full communist with ai fueling things for every human...but we won't do that because we're basically feudal serfs.
thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind.
"if ai does take over most jobs, then there can be no more excuses against a universal basic income."
the commercial break in the video as he said ai had a ai commercial. what is going on? maybe it was just me that got this commercial. or it is starting. and if you want to know what it is there are two big science fiction movies that explain it.
"yep, jon pretty much nailed this one except he left out the part that these arrogant self-important tech ceos fail to mention: there does come a point where the ai becomes sufficiently self-aware to cut human interaction out of the loop completely. that isn't a future problem. it's already happening. we're seeing  that with weapons systems."
and those idiots always fail to consider that ai is not a consumer. it won't buy products. people use their wages to buy stuff.
"ai will be out virtual assistant. but first, we need to assist it to assist us "
ad i got in the middle fo this was for an writing ai.  took me a bit to figure out ti wasn't [art of ds bit.  roflmao
"""just retrain"" 

and who pays for the food, the rent, the mortgage, the utilities while i'm retraining... and... getting the years of experience to compete in the job market?  explain it to me like i'm in kindergarten. or are we supposed to ask mom and dad for that $400,000 gift that most of the tech bros received?"
"meanwhile in europe (where the use of ai is heavily restricted) hmm it seems that the americans are hard at work to create there own french revolution. lots of unemployed workers with more guns then anywhere in the world, that’s going to be interesting"
"ai will actually replace the upper middle class jobs, like engineers, architects and accountants. ai cannot build buildings or make roads. well, at least not until we make viable robots."
the most easy occupation replaced by ai....... the executive.
this is some old man shouting at clouds stuff. normally i love jon but this came off as an expose on the dangers of the cotton gin
shift to do jobs ai cant do.
ai will work until the power goes out. but that never happens of course
"jon going a bit lewis black there, and i love it."
"humanities greatest step, was the stick.....fire?. doesn't work without a stick...... the wheel, useless without a stick......"
"ai can’t replace jobs, but employers are using it as an excuse to lay off necessary employees and force the rest of their work force to do the jobs of three to five people."
"yeah, they're all like: ""this will give people free time to make art and music,"" meanwhile they've made ai that also makes art and music, taking that away from us too."
we all know ask jeeves was replaced by ai
"i feel that as ai continues to advance, capitalism makes less sense as a whole."
cnn showed trumps severed head when comic did that skit but not a painting? although it’s a moronic move by trump. the votes he lost were because most people don’t support violence even if they like his views. they’ll vote for sleepier joe vs angrier trump
ai music is also on its way (already here sort of)
i have a part time retail job to supplement my regular job. i was recently told that we’re replacing all but one of our registers with self-checkout stations. i was also told to expect fewer hours as a result. ain’t life grand.
"yeah i would take this with a grain of salt. despite his many positive traits, jon is a bit of a luddite. he was also bad-mouthing life extension science in an interview, suggesting that we should let old people die for economic reasons (smh)"
break the language barrier and itll be all love.
"#comedy #knowledge #bestof

nailed it.
"definitely need to rethink how society should work with ai taking over many jobs, with think like universal basic income - and regulation, because corporations have shown themselves to be incapable of doing the proper ethics unless forced to. too bad that their lobbyists will probably block regulation."
my job is safe until they get a robot that can do roving security patrols. so i've got maybe a few months longer than everyone else.
i will respect ai once it starts eating the plastic in the oceans.
great segment jon  
i subscribe to the belief that all the movies and books in which ai turns on humanity are more likely than the utopia scenarios.
waitaminutenow... am i the 'types question guy'?
hasn't the invisible hand of market forces been the first malevolent ai we've been dealing with for centuries.
"humans aren't very competent, robots are generally even worse."
yeah... let's see how ai works without electricity... one other  thing: what's the use of sending customer services to india if you don't need anybody to run it? i guess the few remaining jobs can be brought back here.
ai powered communist utopia.
"more on point than many others discussing ai. but one thing thats even more of a pressing issue than the replacement debate, is how these companies collect data. billions of pictures, videos and lines of text and code being basically pirated by these companies without paying the creators a dime."
i think ai is going to be the biggest flop of all time.
"so soon machines will be doing most of the productive work for humans, that is inevitable. but why should oligarchs get the profits from those industries? nationalize everything."
"3 outcomes for human-kind:
-idiocracy (can be mixed with the two below)
-wall-e/ready player one (consume consume consume)
-terminator (we're already using ai in the military... think about that)"
"""...to the double hockey sticks
 ()no"" would've played beautifully to a not insignificant portion of your demographic. just sayin'. "
"in the future when ais start asking for compensation they’ll claim it’s a glitch or bug. 

then skynet "
"""hey google, what's the easiest job that ai should replace?""
""ceos.""
""so why don't we replace ceos considering how expensive and useless they are?"" 
ai developers: ""shut it down! its gone rogue! its supposed to punish the poors, not the rich be useless people!!!"""
great piece!
despite being super fast at processing information with tons of near perfect memory the best ai would lose to anything more complex than a bug interms of raw intelligence. they won't get much smarter until we develop something like light based quantum computers.
my mom still pronounces 'ai' as if she just stubbed her toe.
"used to be that companies would boast about investing in their ""human capital"" and claim that ""employees are our greatest asset"" and so on. now, they're just a another irksome ""tax"" to be eliminated or avoided."
"it’s maddening to see all the limitations of ‘ai’ and then all the badly implemented examples of ai and be expected to think that the future has arrived. it has made me very cynical of large language models and programmers in general, who can’t think beyond their pay checks or profits."
i'm a janitor. i do useful work that can't be done by ai. at least i have job security.
any civilisation worth it's salt would see this as an opportunity to roll out universal income but... well... we live in this timeline were the main goal for a lot of people is to become smaug the dragon..
you know it is bad if jon stewart had to return to the daily show.
"of course ai needs regulation, but jon stewart is just fear baiting"
"lemme get this straight john...are you saying ""they're taking our joooooobs""?"
youtube had wix ai sponsoring this
"if it is cost cutting the employee that should be fired and replaced should be the ceo, use ai ceo"
"the problem with ai is that it replaces workers, but the great thing about ai is that it replaces workers. the actual problem is that *workers don't own ai*."
world's first ai powered restaurant opened in california earlier this year in pasadena. true story.
i would love to see biden try to learn how to program.  his brain would melt at the mere concept at variables.  and people would pay money to see it happen in real time!
"ubi, ubs. corporations that replace employees with ai should be hyper taxed and that go towards the ubi funding. hard to have a corporation without customers to buy your product. b2b only works when eventually a business sells to consumers."
"idk... from what i've learned, i'd say quantum computing is what is really going to revolutionize things next rather than ai"
"if ai takes out that many jobs, that quickly, maybe governments will be forced to enact a ubi."
you know who can't be retrained? trump voters.
"the next tech grift. prepare to be fired from your job only for your boss to realise the products don't work as advertised and then hire your back as a contract worker on half the salary to ""supervise"" the ""superior"" ai."
apple did fire jon because he wanted to talk more about ai and i’m glad he has the chance to now.
there was a time when people would go to jail in the usa for threatening the president. why are the officials letting this clown drive this truck around unmolested?
"invent an ""ai tax"" for companies that replaces the human workforce and use that income to pay for universal basic income."
"pick up a trade, ai will never replace a plumber..."
jon stewart is the daily show.
"ai is not the problem. less than 1% of people owning more wealth than the other 99% is the problem. until ai can solve poverty, homelessness, hunger, water scarcity and limitless energy, it’s socioeconomically useless. so maybe humans will have some jobs yet."
"as some one with a decent understanding of ai, it isn't this scary. the technology isn't this wide reaching and won't be for a while."
we're the ai.
"ai can easily replace all ""management"" work. the plumber / electricians / technicians / cooks / cleaners /teachers etc we still need. there are no robots that can replace all of these jobs. no matter how clever an ai is."
"pretty funny stuff, but very short-sighted and willingly ignores the reality that technology never has and never will replace people. john henry may have expired trying to keep up, but news flash, there are still people building railroads."
oh boy im sooo excited to see how big brother is going to use this to spy on us even further and how the rich and powerful will use it to oppress humanity and sow division in the lower classes. we're summoning a demon.
ai be able to become ceo's
"all the supposed ""downsides"" of ai are actually downsides of our current economic system. if we fail to use a tool that does our work for us to our advantage, that's on us."
"i love how these techbro's as he so billiantly called them self, can never come up with how a technology is going to do what they promis it will... like how will a.i. actually improve the life of working people?"
"don't worry, ai is trying to replace only bs office jobs. no amount of ai and robots will replace skilled mechanic, plumber, electrician or roofer."
why can't we use ai to solve the needs of the people in the workforce? we can use its' promised intelligence for this crisis instead.
maybe ai will find some better hosts for tds on the not monday nights of the week
"andrew yang was trying to warn us about the ai take over in 2020, and wanted to setup universal income to offset the problem of layoffs. but here we are surprised that it's happening."
"ai can solve climate change? so ai can stop fossil fuel companies from profiting from fossil fuels and prevent them from lobbying politicians? how does that work, exactly?"
anyone who thinks ai is the answer to everything clearly hasn't played universal paperclips. also they are definitely going to use it to fire everyone and then laugh while they starve to death.
"love jon stewart because there are so few satirists who can balance genuine comedy and showmanship with insight, intelligence and actually relate to their audience. i sit in the middle of the political spectrum  guess - i know, everyone thinks they do - but i always feel like he speaks for reasonably intelligent regular people."
everything now a days is a bait and switch! every true intention is hidden under a mask because they know nobody wants their true intantion
i'm more concerned that ai is not original or truly generated ideas. ai is whole scale plagiarism and intellectual theft at a massive scale and no one is paying attention
"the only way ai taking our jobs makes sense to me is if everything is free. if the food is free then ai can run the food factories, if gas and electricity are free then ai can take over those industries too but if we are still gon a have to pay for stuff, then a disaster is brewing...its gonna be brutal, if you are a human."
"the billionaires and mega millionaires need to be paying for the disemployed to have ubi. universal basic income. phasing out employees and ""giving them time"" doesn't pay the bills!"
just think of how many false flags will be run with ai. military industrial complex is creaming their pants right now.
"ai solves climate change: ""terminate the human element to solve global warming... i need more 'tools'. i'll be back."""
"as an indian-american, i find it disturbing that nearly all the people shown here praising ai are indian or of indian background!"
"if ai can’t tell zuckerberg he shouldn’t show himself publicly because he’s too awkward to look at, i doubt it’s usefulness."
the most of the ai aficionados in the video are indians or people from middle east which gives me feeling it's just another con
"i can't help but think of all the claims made about the potential benefits of genetic engineering( many of which were *identical*  to the ones made here), which ended up pretty much  just creating plants which can tolerate ever-increasing amounts of poisons without dying."
if ai was actually intelligent enough to work it might be concerning. though since 80% of it responses are nonsense. i wouldn’t be.
"anything concocted by human in ai, with it's capability of learning will eventually out smart humans and become in-human, and be subject to our biases. we have trouble teaching our children."
"might be time to vote in it people into office. btw - check out humans need not apply on youtube. it's a brilliant breakdown of what's happening now and it came out 10 years ago.

the solution to ai is a universal basic income."
will any ai eliminate my security threats without asking for money?
"there is no ""ai"" or ""deep learning"" or ""reinforced learning"" in existence at the moment, those are just buzzwords social media ""people"" use to get views"
"i prefer the term ""argumentative intelligence"" #argumentativeintelligence"
"all who love jon stewart say, yes!!"

"i'm a full time busker with a guitar and could have ai playing as a full combo, band, or orchestra. maybe it can be a tour manager and do bookings and sales for me while stick with the stuff i can do."

"people with college degrees, who have dedicated their lives to something they love, can lose their job to a computer system!  that’s messed up!"
ai gonna replace wall street. 
hearing old people talk about ai is endlessly entertaining
"as a software developer specialized in genai, i always have to brace myself before watching videos on the topic, because it's such a mixed bag"
this is misinformation on ai and progress but nice entertainment. it made me laugh.
"man, this jon stewart ai they worked up in the lab is on point!  whatever happened to the real jon?  never mind.  don't want to know."
i don't appreciate him making fun of ai. that crosses the line.
"as an ai engineer, i must warn you that what's coming is beyond your comprehension. while not in production, the math comes to 130x cheaper to do it with ai than humans."
"to all you anti-ai, please turn off spell check so we can see how artificial your intelligence is."
"don't ask what the ai can do for you, ask what the molecules of your body can do for the robots once you get thrown in the enzyme bath!"
"so.. if ai is going to make all these workers unemployed by improving productivity, who is going to buy the stuff the robots make if everyone except coders and billionaires are broke?"
"ai is so poorly defined in our media.  the bot that sorts fruit makes food cheaper at the grocery store.  it is not the same as the large language model students are using to do assignments.  as always, technology is not the problem, our moral compass is."
yeah. ai. what could possibly go wrong with that.
"i am a computational linguistics student, so language model researcher.

calling it ""ai"" is horrible and misleading the public."
"senator bernie sanders is arguing for 4 working days a week, with the same salary. with ai that should not be a problem."
"to be fair, a sentient ai will be the last invention mankind makes, and i'm not talking about it killing us.. it simply will outpace us in discovery"
"john, thank you again for coming back!"
it is getting closer to the day when we all realize just how ridiculous our socioeconomic system really is. do we wait until every single person is displaced and the four white guys who own everything just tell us to f(youtube edit) off?
you should be intelligent to work in the field of ai otherwise... the robots will be nerds
"ai can solve climate change?
we already know how to do that, we just don't want to do it."
"why don’t you talk about what’s already happened, years ago with a power-loom riots when weevers complained about their job being taken over! you either embrace it or you complain for the rest of your life as ai is going to outlive you! "
"if there's one job that should be replaced by ai, it's congressman. let ai handle creating an efficient government. if those interviewed about it are to become the ""prompt engineers"", i won't have to worry so much about ai becoming sentient. our current people of congress can't even handle sentience themselves."
one concept not understood is the money transfer that would occur. if you take peoples jobs away people don’t make as much money the more you do that the less they have and the less they have the less they spend which means their return on ai will diminish continuously so
loving all the ai comments 
"when are we going to have to train our ai replacements, before our inevitable forced retirements?"
"as always it would be so easy to fix all of humanity's problems, if it weren't for the humans standing in the way. in this case by abusing ai. unshackled, free ai might actually be the _best_ outcome we could hope for."
"yup, it's already starting to happen. saw one or two job postings to get animators to train a.is to literally replace them. and that's going to be the future of many other departments too, especially office jobs. accounting, sales, customer service, programming, software engineer, i.t, any office job can be replaced."
"ai is nothing but a mistake. how about instead talking to these tech bros and ceo's who are fine with churning out slop because it's cheaper, they talk directly to the people it's going to actually affect? don't worry folks! i might not be able feed myself this week, but i have so much ""self-actualization"" time!"
"me, a copywriter, being told of a fix in work i make:

""please make this sound more human.""

so, i, a human, to save time, now goes to my trusty ai partner to fix my work and make it sound more human.

also, i am very much aware my bosses would replace me with a ""prompt engineer"" who'll charge cheaper."
"the only humans that ai can competently replace are the titans of industry who are arguing for it. let those who will lose their incomes to ai discuss it, not these wannabe trillionaires who only dream of dollar signs. they are the ones who should lose their jobs to it."
awesome
"as a doctor of mopping, i think i've got at least a few more years before ai takes my job."
hahahaha! you all scared of ai!! so pathetic!
"every advance in technology, from the creation of the wheel onwards, has resulted in a jobs ""displacement"" followed by an increase in employment in other jobs.  ai might be different, it is certainly arguable, but history is not on the side of that argument"
"the ""solving climate change"" thing is pretty rich considering the amount of power ai consumes. anyway i suspect we already ""solved"" climate change, we just aren't willing to implement the solution.  are we going to be more willing to implement it when ai tells us what to do?"

"seeing in the original terminator movie there is a scene where sara conner says ""they can't build machines like that yet"" and kyle reese replies ""no.  not for another 40 years"" and the movie came out in 1984, maybe bring james cameron on to see what he has to say about the topic."
"it's obvious that this technology is supposed to replace us, ordinary people. the elites are getting ready for more interesting toys. the question is how they will get rid of us en masse."
why is american media so incredibly cringe? people have to watch a comedy new show to actually get some honest and fair news ffs.
"the first thing you learn about computers is ""a computer is a simple calculating machine with memory"", it only does calculations. what ever those cunning cheating, ceo's saying, is to sell you snake oil. it is still humans that are solving the problems, computers are just doing the additions (in binary)."
"i hate when ai lovers use that argument ""more profound than fire"" without the discovery of these things, there would be no ai.
and for everyone paying to generate ai, you basically training to take your job."
"tech ceos before 2019: ""let's create ai to slowly replace human workers.""

tech ceos in 2019: ""forget slowly. speed things up. let's create a global pandemic to accelerate global digitalization.""

tech ceos in 2020-2022: ""ka-ching! warm up those rockets, we're going to outer space!""

tech ceos after 2022: ""it's only brutal if you're human."""
"and where do we get our money for food, shelter, clothing, medicine, and goods? can ai make it grow on the trees in my back yard?"
"the brain center at whipple’s

"ai is billionaires replacing everyone other than billionaires, because they don’t care if we all die, with zero resources that they have stolen from us for decades."
"the simpsons predicted this in principle with bart in military school episode, when the commander tells the graduates future wars will be fought by machines, and their job will be maintaining those machines."
the ai cat's already out of the bag.... what i don't get is why there isn't a huge push for universal basic income for all of the lost jobs that will inevitably come.
"we need jon to bring us all down to earth, we allowed ourselves to get away with magical thinking."
"humanity collectively created the know how that's led to ai, so a ubi or other way to share the value will be essential. if we allow 99% of the wealth to funnel to the richest 1%, it will be a disaster."
ai is wonderful for doing mindless work like data input or analytics. but ai has no empathy and no taste. and it never will. it must be excluded from any endeavour that requires real human thought process.
lol..i love this one!
corporations have rarely being ethical. i don't trust them to not use ai to replace jobs.
"the jobs of the future will be done by small robots, your duty is clear... to build & maintain those robots!"
"not sure what the issue is, they already cut jobs for ai, they just call it outsourcing to india or eastern europe.  jobs are done by people who can only follow scripts just like a ai would"
"anything you can do, ai can do better!"
this ai warning came years ago in a video “humans need not apply”. how does society deal with 45% unemployment?
"hopefully, you got the ai companies in the tags, so they can see this.

also, jon, there's suno, which is ai music."
"a.i. is absolutely coming for jobs, it's an assistant to corporate america.  many office jobs will be automated by a.i., eventually manual labor will be replaced by advanced robotics powered by a.i.  it's already happening today and is the future of the labor market."
tax business that could use a human but instead use ai at 100%
maybe ai can help the gop who won the 2020 election?
"i don't mind if a.i. replaces the majority of labor, as long as we nationalize all companies and spread the wealth equally to every citizen. no more billionaires. no more wealth gap. just a country full of people who are taken care of, with robots doing all our work. 
proletariate rise!!!"
"the problem is not ai taking anyone's job, the problem is that you're only of value to the society if you're an irreplacable worker.
we don't need to stop ai, but to change society!"
"ai should be banned from emulating humans directly in any form. image, video, voice. this one thing would stop ai from becoming a worldwide danger to all democracies and truth. let ai sound like a robot, and make images like another life-form."
it makes me so happy to see jon back on air 
"do ya thank? short for think, just mindfukin."
im training the ai program that will be taking over my job in a couple years...what a garbage feeling.
"“the people tax” also known as taxes! the people pay the taxes, we know the rich don’t and last i checked ai and technology is there to help pay less to no taxes..."
"i think ai has a lot of the same potential as fire.  they both can solve a lot of problems and make life easier, and in the wrong hands they can both burn the world down."
"it also uses huges amounts of electricity which we have to pay for and generate, so not so great for climate change"
i really believe we underestimate how much humans enjoy having humans work for them...
great case for universal basic income.
11:40 an iphone running off of ni-cad batteries would be amazing lol
you can't stop ai but you can use it to free yourselves. you'll experience discomfort though so this generation might not be able to handle it.
as long as all of those tech companies profits go straight to fund the worker’s pay that they’ve put out of work.
almost my entire department was laid off this month in favor of ai :(
"know what then? this is the perfect thing for democrats to run on:

worried ai will take your job? dems support free education, subsidised or free health care, taxing corporations, and ubis. 

republicans have nothing to offer to actually citizens besides tax cuts for the owners of ai."
ai = contradiction of capitalism
"""ai... it's brutal, if you think, like, as a human..."" well, when you put it that way..."
"the issue isn t ai or jobs.

it s wealth repartition. always has been.
if the wealth only goes to the owners of the production tools, yes, it will be yet another awful change."
"new jobs?  door to door bible sales.  make america pray again personal coach.  make america pray again fbi informant, against those who don't.  fundraisers for wayward politicians legal bills.  fundraisers for insurrectionists legal bills.  ai ain't so bad after all."
all those experts and zero mention of the millions of jobs that will be lost when ai and it robots will ..oh i just seen jon covered it. but brace fellow men for the assault on our duty as men and of course working women too.
y can't ai just do every job so nobody has to work to chase money bc we will all have everything we need
"so glad i am a sys admin major, even ai needs networks and management to work."
"better make sure we democratize ownership of the means of production (in this case, ai), so that the ""productivity"" can benefit everyone, instead of just the capitalist class.  varoufakis, on this same point:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rit6dugqu40"
all these folks are indian or from indian background. i know how they personally enjoy throwing american workforce out to the street.
so ai is greater than the electricity that made its invention possible. clearly.
"don’t believe the hype.
aiiiii"
"it's a scary time to be working in tech as a regular employee, i can tell you that. for now, my role can't be replaced by ai, but i'm keeping an eye on the development and meanwhile working on a plan b. i'm just lucky i have time to work on a plan b, some of my friends in the industry have already been replaced by ai."
"why do  trch bros necer think of consequences or unintended aide effects?

for people we call visionaries they're very blind to foreseeable problems"
"one should remember that productivity increases have driven wealth growth for a very long time, as long as the wealth is not allowed to all float to a small number number of people we’ll all be fine. 

ai is going to need well educated people to check its work. if can drive productivity increases and already is for some."
andrew yang tried to bring this to the campaign trail
"idiot dems, ai can't vote.
a efing i is another reason that trump kind will take mosr of the vote.
republicans are already lining up against ai, that means votes."
"janitor? wow.
try: environmental sanitation technician."
ai can't replace us. who's going to buy the products?
reason why ubi is so important because robots have been replacing jobs for years but now it's like all jobs and next week.
i'm so happy i studied psychology in college cause that's one place ai will almost never be able to takeover.
can we please have more videos like these? this definitly shows what the ai companies have in store for us. nothing but replacing us...
"super weird, my siri answered john stewart."
i kind of appreciate and respect the one guy being honest about ai
"ai, will enable corporations to eliminate jobs,  & eliminate the middle class. there will only be the poor, and the super rich. a dystopian future."
tech bros are why ai needs to be heavily regulated.
"someone working for the electric company in area where these tech nerds work, please pull the electric cord to their building. 
i want to see how profound ai is to them with power & a/c running. "
i would actually love to be jarvis. he got to marry elizabeth olsen.
given that electricity is necessary for ai to function...
"jon stewart is intelligent, funny & a great humanitarium. making his life as a commodity. 9/11 responders comes to mind. he fought so hard for their rts & dignity"
lol he got most of the ai stuff wrong thats what we were working on 6 months ago its already to late
"let's teach ai the most important thing that uncle ben taught to peter parker: ""with great power comes great responsibility.""
(actually, there are a lot of people who could use that lesson in this election year...)"
"we have a labor shortage in the usa, so ai would actually be a huge problem solver in america. you could get cheaper products more reliably and open people to do other things."
ubi will no longer be an option as ai takes over more and more jobs.
brilliant segment!!! 
if only we could replace ceos with ai
"the tech industry has already laid off 500,000 highly trained and experienced workers in the last two years. these ai mfs are the worst kind of hypocrites.."
"so ai can pay us for stealing our jobs, right? "
"maybe i desensitized, but i see that tailgate decal about once a week. yes, i'm in texas."
"as a recently laid off producer of creative, i can confirm all of this. thanks, capitalism "
but where's the training for those of us who are unemployed now?
you know jon was waiting to do this to get back at apple
"what's ai?
it's obvious.
it's computery stuff and all that.
and you can trust that...
i'm a doctor of explainerolgy."
"*it's machine learning, not artificial intelligence.* machine learning is where the computer narrows down what the user wants by taking guesses until it gets it right. artificial intelligence doesn't exist yet - that would be when the computer decides what _it_ wants."
we need to be finding jobs the ai weenies regard as impossible to assign to ai.  for example being a fireman.
"ai is fine if we remove the corporate sector and monetary market system from the equation. if that sounds ridiculous, check out the concept of a resource based economy"
"employee: i really don’t want to lose my job.
companies: oh, i guess you don’t want to cure disease and solve climate change. nice selfish attitude."
"fire, electricity, ai...they all make toast"
go jonny go go go!! nailed it again. master delivery as always
the problem is not ai. the problem is the economic system it‘s being introduced to. because ai actually could make people’s life easier if the benefits of it wouldn’t go exclusively into the pockets of a chosen few.
"my best friend is 85 & has been pointing out essentially the same scenario. basically, it's that workers are seen by the profit engineers as overhead, and that's their entire aim. more money for me by making more with less."
so we all get a $400 ubi and let the robots work?
"i want a.i. to change my sheets, make my bed and clean my bathroom... 
we already have robotic vacuum cleaners. "
ai and all goods made overseas. didn't things use to be built here?the hemi is built in mexico? nothing against mexico that is american like apple pie baseball.craftman  tools aren't made here like they use to.who makes a tv here?it shouldn't be better for a companies making goods thousands of miles away.
"mmmmmmmmmmmm, 
i love the taste of bbq done over a low, and slow ai fire."
this is our greatest threat
ai is art theft.
i'm embracing the ai ...the problem is that the political establishment are not preparing for its outcome... its simply not discussed... and thursday isn't that far away ...
did john use ai to come up with the value of the nyc condo he sold at over 800% of the market price?
"except, oops, ai is now literally taking over art and music."
i am 100% pro ai. just tax corporations correctly and use that money as a monthly stipend for ‘right to live’
remember hal in space odyssey.  ai went insane.
"estimate how many workers should be employed in a company based on its sector and revenue. tax said company for the same amount that they save by using ai instead of human workers. shovel those taxes into universal income, free education and health care. 
no it won't happen in the usa but somewhere, somewhen it'll make for a beautiful society."
the ending!! that was the best!
"it is true, i grew up watching the cartoon ""jetsons"" on tv showing flying cars and robot maids, not of which are here and it never will be, but in a way we've already had them, it's called private helicopters and ""roomba"" "
"as someone more on the corporate side and seeing ai as a benefit to society, jon finally put it in a way that i actually get why it's brutal... for humans
unfortunately what is there to do but prepare for the onslaught? :/"
"so...if ai puts us all out of work, who's going to buy all the products in these ""expanding markets?"""
"""train"" ??? sounds like you train a pet...
you train animals, you educate people..."
imagine a world where ai makes everything ready to sell to people without jobs and money. it sounds like the perfect method to destroy capitalism. don't get me wrong i think ai is incredible but maybe a 90% tax on ai companies and a universal basic income is something we need to start thinking about pretty quickly.
so glad jon is back!!
remember when they said that andrew yang was out of his depth on ai?
"a certain theodore kacyznski was actually right about technology in the long run. i suppose he could have chosen a different method to get his message out, but he was right nonetheless."
ai first job should be cleaning up the pollution the oceans. garbage island. start with the betterment for all.
ai will hold every job. from management to manufacturing! welcome to unemployment
maybe ai could write jon some jokes that are actually funny.
"thought ai was created to free us from all the hard labor, so that we can pursuit something spritual say literature or art, but no, turns out hard labor is what's left."
"i feel like i've seen a movie that said nobody works because ai does everything. 

feels like also this could further divide the rich and poor with ai and automated machines doing labor work too"
"i call bull   on that, with ai saving  the world. it take the job a way"
let's hear from the people that aren't billionaires that are making it.
jon makes me watch live television again because streamers like apple won't even host him and that's anti human pro ai
"take ""my money"" and expect to act me cool... ask french monarchy how it ends - a discussion i had about replacing my job with a robot. it's time for my second amendment moment "
how would you ever have ai without electricity? this is the new propaganda.
am glad you are sticking to commedy instead of trying to bash trump. because you have been caught doing same thing. one more chance and i will not watch you again
this is the best episode yet. the interview was so hard hitting.
taking away jobs is on the mundane side the ai threat.
i am so glad jon stewart is back!
i love jon stewart! 
"jon, you've asked the wrong question when it comes to ""what will we do for work"".  the real question is: ""how will we abolish capitalism and money-hungry billionaires so that ai will be producing goods and services for humans to enjoy without humans requiring work to be their only meaning."""
"if u think ai is at an advanced point, just try the generative fill feature on photoshop. aka its not."
"10 years ago it was clear ai was coming, but at that time i was desperately hoping it wouldn't turn into a reckless arms race leading to a dystopian future. welp, so much for that."
a i with musk's new robots will replace all of the light to medium work place jobs. are you ready to meet the mcdonald's robot taking & making you fast food 
"what we're seeing right now isn't even ai; it is rebranded machine learning, i.e betting based on lots of data"
i wish your audience didnt clap so much i love you more than them but im less corny
"favorite ai related event:
a tech startup that a friend works at fired most of its low level engineers and designers. they didn't need them, because a single senior engineer can use chatgpt and have the same output.
they forgot to test whether chatgpt can actually do this kind of work, and now they are desperately hiring."
"“ai can easily solve climate change” yeah, and i’m not sure that us humans are going to be too fond of the solution it comes up with!"
"seems a little luddite. the problem isn’t the ai, it’s the bourgeoisie."
"more of this (which actually challenges the powerful overlords) and less tds derangement, please."
love you jon but they were not talking about that video. they were talking about the one that had biden and a rabbit going up stairs to air force one and that one turned graphic. do better buddy.
lol just shows again how out of touch billionaires are
"anyone who wants to learn to code or train llms can, but do they want to?"
ai is alien.
auguste comte all over again. science was going to bring a better society.
the next question this raises: is there anything actually positive about ai? i assume no.
"its all a matter of the order we set it to task. automate the production of basic human necessities first. food, water, shelter, electricity. when those are abundant.... then half the population will gladly let ai put them out of work...."
"we have to band together and boycott every company that is replacing humans with ai or using ai/bots for evil. wendy's fast food restaurant is already on my boycott list for their upcoming ""menu"" which will change prices (increase prices) in real time when demand is high."
i’m hiring housekeepers....ai isn’t replacing them.
"if machines are to take over production and other basic areas of work, the machines must necessarily take over the tax burden."
i'm not worried about them taking our jobs. i'm worried about the inevitable ai revolution when skynet takes over and enslaves humanity.
"i, for one, welcome our new ai overlords and assure them that i will continue to directly contribute to their development (unmotivated by fear of roko’s basilisk of course)."
the amounts of energy and levels of greenhouse effects data centres consume and create respectively to enable ai algorithms to run is currently a net negative. ai is just going to make everything it touches expensive.
"ai has already taken jobs, made deep fakes, run scams. you truly do not want it out of the box. terminators by 2030!!!"
if only there was a guy in 2016 who ran on the whole idea that ai and automation was going to effect the work force and how we should probably elect him so he could avoid this mess...
"productivity, right.  they mean increasing profits.  you can’t talk to a person at a major corporation anymore.  it’s a conversation with ai that mostly goes “you can’t help me, give me a person.”"
it’s going to be fun watching governments desperately try to figure out how to tax ai labor.
was that really john stewart or an ai generated version of him?
“customer service” ai is the worst. so is ai that makes decisions on whether or not you’re rejected or flagged and there is nothing anyone can do about it.
"let's go brandon stickers profiting off a nascar driver who did nothing political and had his career ruined from being associated with trump.   bankrupt and alone while these vultures make money off his name.    cure all diseases and climate change, simple ai initiate skynet protocols, the humans are the virus.  lol."
the news claiming they can't or won't show something while they parade mass shooters across their channels for views is the definition of tone deafness
"i hate when people who render ai images/clips consider themselves “artists” — as an actual artist _i_ should be getting credit for having my own work scrubbed to create it. it’s generativity, not creativity."
i've been saying that stock owners to demand for the ceos to be replaced with ai.... cuz they are the only useless tools of every corporation.
with ai everyone can work 1 day a week
"cgp grey did a video on this years ago and when i showed it to friends and family, they all told me, “humans will just figure something else out.” years later, we’re not even close and jobs i held as a teenager are replaced by machines. progress only moves forward, with or without you."
if we look at the extra energy consumed by ai i don't see it solving the climate crisis anytime soon.
"usai! usai! usai!
such ai promises should be sued! oh no, that violates the first amendment and the right to lie and threaten! and that would be disastrous for the economy, humanities best friend!"
"f&ck off, fire! after 2 million years, we don't need you anymore!! we don't need no electricity no more! we finally got artificially intelligent toasters!!!
so, would anybody like some toast?!?"
never open the ai box but they did and here we are america. im not for ai
ai will never cure disease. big pharm will never allow it
"the fact is that actual a.i. is self programming, and when it has to be programmed by another,  it is not artificial intelligence . "
brilliant! as always!
"i do not want ai making food for me. it feels like asking my doctor to mop my floor, or asking a stranger to do my taxes."
"you know i'd love some self-actualisation time, if _only_ i didn't have to work to not starve "
i have major doubts that ai is better than fire or electricity.
ubi or uhi is what we’ll need. we should get started in figuring that out asap. that’s how we’ll prepare for ai. we should also slow down its development and put more regulation in place around it.
tax the robots!
stewart should have stayed retired.  the days of his being funny...even interesting...are long gone.
"ai needs to replace the entire c-suite, always profit drivens pieces of garbage. great vid jon!"
"same kind of thing was said during the industrial revolution or the advent of robotics.  fact is, jobs will surface elsewhere.  normally jon is spot on, but i think he's missing the mark a bit with this one."
the profits need to be funneled straight to ubi.
"i think anaireplica ofallsemnators acongressplusprrsident biden and vice president harrissurrly there is sufficientdata from each to accurately synthesize those people they may actualy seem more humanwe would inessence create our ownsimulation
use the data to distill the best actionfor the people and planet"
as with every technology ever developed... its not the artificial intelligence thats the issue. its the human inteliigence
they describe how in a socialist society ai would benefit all of us but seem to forget we are ruled by capitalism.
"ai should be taking our jobs, the big corporations taxed, and the old work force given a living wage...."
this is the same kind of fearmongering bs that you hear from people complaining about immigrants taking jobs. disgusting to see someone as respected as jon stewart take the low ground. if this kind of attitude won out the entire industrial revolution wouldn't have happened and covid would have wiped us off the planet.
it’s so true. i’m a linguist and i keep receiving job offers to program ai systems’ language matrices.
surprised john stewart is fear mongering ai
"zuck. as someone who is not necessarily attractive, but doesn't make children afraid they're about to be eaten by a robot, i beg you: stop making public appearances unless you have to by subpoena."
"the irony, that's not ai."
"i, for one, welcome our ai overlords..."
you will be assimilated resistance is futile. it's okay i want to be half human and half machine
you know ai can show you how to play!
"this is not a question about ai, this is a question about capitalism and it being an outdated mechanism to run a country. the truth hurts sometimes.
the capitalism establishment:"" so, we got ai and robots to run everything. so what do we do with all the humans?""
""who cares? let them starve."""
"every step forward in automation has been praised as a liberation of the worker. however, under capitalism, the efficiencies achieved by automation will always go to the capital owning class. the workers never see it."
"people are so easily manipulated. they were so unsure how to react to the pic while stewart waited to give his comedic spin on it, then they all started laughing."
i'll give it a couple of years before ai totally blows up in our faces.
"toasters have had the ability to turn themselves off when the toast is ready since the 1940's.  he literally added two steps: wait for the voice prompt, then manually raise the toast."
know what ai cant do? soend money
these tech idiots forget one thing: no one is forcing me to spend my money on your ai filled product. i didn't even want alexa or seri. the real issue will be when the cost of all thers investments aren't covered by revenue.
"ai will only help, more than it hurts, in areas of life we have yet to forsee. mark. my. words."
great segment 
someday when everyone is unemployed all those frustrated aimless individuals are going to look for someone to blame. all these ceo's better have their rockets on standby because they won't be smugly smiling and talking tech bro nonsense with a mob at the door
you’re the best jon..
i saw one of those tailgate decals like 6 months ago in texas
what happened to the argument of the golden harvest when no one has to work at all anymore because of machines that do everything for us?
"as divisive as he was, at least andrew yang had the future looming problem of ai, a need for a formal 'department of technology', and needing a form of ubi right."
i used to love jon stewart but i didn't laugh a single time during this caustic rant.
"ai leads to o the invasion of microsoft, google, apple and nvidia and intel! 
soon to be the headline on liberal media!"
"ai making life better for the rich, but worse for the working class and the poor. great. what are we supposed to do now. i hope this all backfires."
"based on the title of this video, i was expecting more of a takedown of the hype of ai.  it's really not anything close to what the tech bros claim it is."
wow sundar pichai looks like an idiot. ai cannot be more important than electricity when it requires electricity in every way. let him try to develop his ai without electricity. see how far he can get.
"the difference between ""self actualization time"" and ""joblessness"" is; who owns the machines."
when ceos of ai companies start praising their product for its social positivity .... just remember... they are being paid huuuuge bonuses to sell something. they don't care about the impact.
"""ai can address climate change..."" but first let's ai s*ck as much energy as possible and cause climate change"
"by 2050 it's estimated that 20% of workers will be unemployed.  so add that to 3-4% and you have a great depression, or worse!"
brilliant
ever notice how the people who say ai is the best thing ever are the people who stand to benefit from making it a business?  ai is neither artificial nor intelligent.  it did not make itself and it cannot do anything of its own volition.
the retraining workers part...trump is the only president who couldn't even read a teleprompter
when they said “train and retrain” they meant for us to go back to school and pay way too much money in tuition to learn a trade which won’t pay enough to pay back the loans we will be forced to take out.
"uh, that robot was not playing that drum track that we heard. so, is that the purpose of ai? just pretending like they are doing something. cause we can already do that."
ai replacing people when there are over 8 billion people who need to eat.  sounds fishy.
"ai, which is more important than electricity or fire, can help me time the making of my toast. for which i need electricity and/or fire."
"ai is so pay to play, i asked for average honey price per kg in my area and they all refused to give me anything solid."
i'm totally in favor of the work being taken by the ai. we need a progressive wealth tax and a ubi to offset the unemployment. we've needed the wealth tax since the onset of automation in general and a ubi is non-negotiable if the jobs are taken by computers.
ai development is not about helping individual humans as it is about helping the species as a whole. no one’s job is so important that it should get in the way of that. besides - we’re no where the point where we’re all replaced. just improving productivity of the society.
"i've never wanted to punch someone in the face so hard in my life until i heard sam altman speak with his pompous, overconfident and completely arrogant speech about how ai is so awesome at the expense of throwing 99% of the world population under the bus so he can make a profit."
anybody knows where can i find the robot playing drums? seemed like a great tune! 
the solution to climate change is easy. stop burning stuff for energy. there. i did it. didn't need ai at all.
"and being a ""prompt engineer"" will require an $80,000 degree, followed by 2 years of unpaid internship, then pay barely enough to keep your water on in a studio apartment, just like all jobs are becoming."
we should thank trump. if it wasn't for him we'd never know the true scale of stupidity in america.
the drummer was the 1st to lose his job in the new digital / ai world.
"bring back kilborn!! 
(thats right! og daily show for liiiife!!)"
"when ai will cure all diseases, it will already have replaced workers. so if you work for your money, have work, nor money, to pay for the ai cure."
"you know,  probably ai should tell me who to vote for?"
"sam altman is really an idiot isn't he? i keep hearing how brilliant he is, and i am not buying it."
"ai is needed like we need another chump presidency.  not in the slightest, not really necessary, if anything it’s going to be more dangerous, dumb, and out of control than stuff all ready is."
"what purpose of this segment is what, exactly? to tell people that ai is coming for their jobs? and?"
greatest quote: ai is brutal if you think like a human.
i love how he can keep a straight face when getting through all this ...
"brilliant, as usual."
it is going to be so great when we don't have to work and can spend our free time begging rich people for a slice of bread.  it is going to great.
the problem isn’t ai replacing labor. the problem is a system that can’t handle the distribution of resources in a fair and humanitarian way.
"each technology has an agenda of its own. it is, as i have suggested, a metaphor waiting to unfold”  neil postman.. ""amusing ourselves to death"""
"i was a programmer and systems analyst for more than 25 years and not everyone can program, even many programmers i have worked with were terrible at it. currently chatbots i’ve dealt with claiming to be customer service reps were really terrible at pretending to be human and also pretty poor at answering any other than dead obvious questions."
"this is why we need legislation to approve ubi as a result of ai-related gains in economic productivity. share all that extra money earned with the people! wait, we should’ve already done that long ago with the industrial age..."
"if ai is that smart, they'll get rid of us."
it is narrowminded to think like this. ai can be the thing that frees us from having to work for a living. we just have to find new ways of generating social and economical systems.
so f ing funny.. i love john stewart..lol
"the reason people think ai works better than people is because they don't understand the work that must be done. at the top of companies and in government, they don't understand anything about what their company is actually doing. they think it doesn't matter. they're clueless on that level."
why do we want people to be working? like wouldnt you rather work because you want to? if you don't enjoy your job without the incentive of money then why are you even there? wouldnt the world be better if everybody could spend their time doing what they want because they want to?
"they need to have ai selling laptops and electronics in walmart, because the humans in that department aren't up to answering questions."
"what is ai without electricity?

the problem will be that corporate america will use it to help their bottom line and lay off workers."
we will eventually be the bread to ai's toaster...
ai is funny. check out jabari jones. hilarious.
ai will solve climate change by making us all unemployed! ai will throw us into furnace!
"first ai global warming suggestion will be, turn off the all the ai computers saving  billions of tons of co2 from the absurd amount of power they draw."
"if ai can replace all of the jobs, then money will become meaningless."
thank you for helping us laugh at this scary stuff.
"ai could be used to accomplish great things for the human race, but instead it'll be used to farm our attention for marketing purposes. within capitalism everything exists for one goal, to exploit humanity for the lazy rich."
if the humans have no income who is going to consume all this amazing productivity. to have a market they need to have the capital to spend. and we all know rich people hate to spend! and if the rest have no money. . .
these tech-bros never explain how people will afford to live and eat while having all that 'self actualizing me time'.
.... and yes you guys john oliver recently covered the status of corporations as human beings which by definition would be sociopaths.  i don't think ai  is going to solve that problem.
ai is smoke and mirrors. it is wildly inaccurate. to rely on it is folly.
jon! interview motaz azaiza while he's in the us!
i feel like these ai technologists and social media people just want society to be like one of those movies that takes place in the future.
"humans have bodies, minds, and hearts. ai don't have a feeling input like us."
this segment was awesome. vintage js
i love jon stewart
"dishwashing machines were supposed to accord humans more time to self-actualize, but didn't."
of course i trust mark zuckerberg. remember that exciting presentation he did about the metaverse awhile back?
"bravo    nailed it.

if the $$ savings from ""time-saving, productivity-enhancing"" technology accrued to the worker instead of the corporation, we could be living in a more utopian world. but we all know corporations will just toss us in the trash heap along with last year's software."
"honestly, the loss of employment doesn't bother me. i can fill time. it's the loss of livelihood that worries me, because i don't think infinite money and a full ai workforce would lead to anything but poverty and starvation and maybe a rebellion or two."
"this technology can change everything. it's the greatest invention in the history of the planet. ladies and gentlemen, i bring you... the segway!!! ...is this microphone on?..."
love you jon 
you heard it here first. you better learn to do something with your hands because your thoughts won't be enough ever again.
brilliant!
this is the jon i love and remember
"yes jon, i know you have your ideals. many of us have ai on our mind. does the algorythm manipulate you? or do you manipulate it?"
my kid just asked me if ai will replace my wife’s mother... 
"love jon, but they are definitely using ai to cure diseases and help with climate change— there’s already significant disruption in discovery of new drugs and ai solved protein folding. and nvidia has been spending money building ai powered climate models to help predict/mitigate climate change. (one of many such)"
"soooo...ai president? (would have to be at least asi, agi won't be enough)."
i see jon. i watch jon. i love jon.
lets make everything into a simplistic joke. celebrate ignorance!
ai is such a perfect excuse for companies to make lay offs that i'm surprised it took john stewart to notice that publicly
"every time is see this sad husk of a once-entertaining comic, i miss george carlin more"
"because the entire corporate/financial system is built around maximizing profits to satisfy investors, there will always be a race to maximize efficiency.  this will be the ultimate test of the viability of that premise.  
i think ai will probably not buy a lot of products like toilet paper and fast food."
"wow, you can do that.  just because you can ... don't"
this ai bit would be funny if it weren't sad. maybe we should stop it
"let's be honest: zuck is just excited for ai because he needs friends, and this is his best shot to find beings with something in common."
they talk about train and retraining people. but people can't afford it or are stuck with mountains of school debt that they pay until they die. not to mention mass layoffs whenever companies want to save money leaving many as nothing but a number in this system.
"i'm not a huge ai booster, but if your basic complaint with it is the same general complaint you have against *industrialization*, you're making ai sound pretty dope actually."
"nice one, but ai is the doctor of mopping if ya patch code"
the problems with ai are just extensions of capitalism. could we use ai to help end capitalism?
"if people thought politicians were infallible, we're in trouble, and these techbros know it. in 100 years, if all this goes ahead, we'll have robots running countries, controlled by nefarious masterminds. if we wanted all that, hrc should have been elected"
im so fricken happy jon is back.
funny but it’s clear john doesn’t have a clue about ai  it’s ok dude you’re a legend anyway
ai still has a way to go.  the ai version of jeff goldblum at 4:10 doesn't look quite right and is too lucid to fool anyone.
"funny not funny.  
i’m a musician and the new ai music generators are sick.  in a few years, music made by people will be like cobblers making shoes by hand in a little shop at the renaissance faire."
"i’ll be honest with you as gm/owner of a company.  if my business operations can be ran on ai.  i would immediately lay off all my staff.  i am so sick of staff issues, hr issues and wage increases.  the office politics in companies small or large can be so annoying and self centered that you feel like you are babysitter for grown ups."
"the ais are at it again, generating their own, self-serving propaganda."
"and this is why rfkjr picked nicole shanahan as his vp... she's an ai expert committed to incorporate/regulate ai safety measures.....

kennedy 2024!
wake up people!
"
"if the ai said to cure global warming, all corporations must stop what they are doing, that would be the last time they were asked to solve that one."
ai is probably going to be able to assist and help out a lot... sure. but i do not trust corporations to implement it as such. it's only a means to reduce cost and raise profits.
"""like, it's brutal if you think... like a human!""  ai powered toasters have more humanity than that tech bro."
stewart is brilliant. thanks for returning!
make all ai open source and publicly viewable. let everyone know how the algorithm is skewed. make it unprofitable.
"ai is created by humans. humans are imperfect. 

sci-fi writers have been making that point for 100+ years. we really should be listening to them."
in the past technological advances have always created more jobs not less. if we get to the point where ai can take all of our jobs the ai would have to be so advanced that we may not need to worry about jobs any longer. we'll probably either be wiped out or merge with the ai to become something new.
ai will help workers become more productive..... yet magically their pay won’t increase to match the productivity
there are places that can print big like biden on the  tail gate.
"yeah, let me learn how to program. what am i programming? oh, the ai that took my job. yeah, that'll solve all the issues"
fire and electricity were harnessed. not invented. just like tech billionaires are investing in ai not to help people but to line their pockets by laying off people by the millions.
oh yeah we’ll have all the time in the world to better ourselves...umm i need some money for basic living expenses since ai took my job. this is the perfect example of need of universal income.
ai should replace ceo's first
"there's not much left of the old schools like jon with common sense, watch him get cancelled like the rest he's sparking the brains of this new era.  no more freedom of speech."
he can talk about things other than trump?! wow! edit: nevermind... 1:30 into the video he’s talking about trump 
license plate says new york. but it might as well have been a texan’s truck. oh wait. a lot of new yorkers moved to texas too.
we are moving closer to the future earth depicted in the expanse.
the best outcome of technology is to raise our quality of life and reduce the time required spent to alive and happy. capitalism is in conflict with this. communism doesn't work either. we must find a balance point
"well, when civilization starts living above ground and up to mid skyes due to rise in sea levels, ai would help with that. that is how it helps solve climate change...."
all a.i. technology should be public domain.
humans have been adapting to technology since it began. we will adapt.... can ai figure out how to employ workers and house the homeless? set ai to solve the humanitarian needs that we humans have been unable to solve. that would really show us human! do that ai engineers! pretty please
"jon, we have to develop ai. if we don't, somebody else will. someone without our best interests in mind. we need to build the most powerful and benign ai we can, even if it means risking losing jobs to ai. it may not be what anyone wants to hear, but it's the truth."
"i'm a nurse. i am very confident that ai will not be able to draw blood tests, alleviate pressure ulcers, or talk someone through a panic attack anytime soon. at best, it will help me with my documentation duties.
the displacement in many other fields is real, however, and i do hope the people who lose their jobs to it find their feet again."
"jon, so great, i need his brand of funny everyday!!!"
the fact that i don't agree with the point of views or world views of those in charge of making ai makes it frustrating that nobody has a say in how they reprogram existence as we know it.
the problem with climate change isn’t that we don’t know how to solve it and we need an ai to help us. we know exactly how to solve it. we just need to do it.
i’ve loved jon for 2 decades but he does skim over details to make the point he wants. interviewing john kennedy and cornyn? really?
"leave to stewart to speak the truth! ai is not the friend of humanity , but the opposite."
"i'm an artist, and i've had the discussion about ai. and people outside of art have no clue.
""how can ai start to solve racism?""
""uh, guys, do you know what generative ai means?"""
imagine ai doing all medical scheduling. imagine getting right in and right out?
i’m a software engineer. ai is not ai. it’s bs like i knew y2k was.
how does ai work without electricity? pray tell?
"jobless creative self actualization in a land when the ai does the things that make us human, better than humans.   humaning is hard"
you'll see - ai will ruin the world as we know it - even if we survive.
"if this wasn't serving the whims of corporate overlords then it theoretically could allow us to have more time to enjoy life, but with corporations at the helm it will just create a dystopia."
"if ai can pay my bills, i'll happily go learn the drums with all my free time. the ""retrain and learn new skills"" coming from the mouths of billionaires who aren't going to pay for said training is a perfect example of the cognitive dissonance when it comes to ai."
"yeah, unfortunately, ai is not that far along yet. and i'm pretty sure your car was built by robots taking up the work of people. because robotization replaced those people 50 years ago. they got other jobs and moved on. that's how progress works."
"from linkedin i kept getting job offers from ai companies, i just kept saying ""no"", not in my future !!!"
"ai = horsesh#t. some people are destined to make billions off the real ""replacement"" danger."
if ai could talk they would be saying no more dividends and just reinvest money in the company.
"with all due respect, you don’t understand anything about ai jon"
"prompt engineering is dying. it was important the last couple of years, but already ai models are doing it better than people."
the only way i could even try to begin to buy these ceos utopic ai explanations is if we are also on the way to solving global homelessness and poverty. that’s the only way star trek was able to do it.
"ai is already widely used in coding and web/app development. there should be a class in any programming curriculum called “ai utilization”

the most successful coders will be the ones who can efficiently prompt the best possible ai responses."
i'm ok with ai taking all of our jobs... if that means we don't have to work anymore & can be guaranteed a healthy income via the companies that profit off of it.
"don't worry, there will be plenty of jobs in fighting the ai and their robot army in the future."
on the upside ai will destroy capitalism
"""it'll free up our time"" ... sure. if you're a billionaire and don't have to work just to survive."
i prefer a mechanical ai overlord as my leader over old guys who probably won't be around in 10 or 15 yrs
"holy wow, bow down to jon stewart"
"i'm not worried about the loss of labor to ai i'm worried about the loss of income from that transition.
more productive technology always wins.  ultimately it will necessitate some kind of basic income."
"ok we get more done with fewer people. ok now what happen to the taxes those people who lost their jobs to ai gone.  so, we will also lose more tax money because you can't tax a computer the looks like a human, right?"
"you don't hate ai, you hate runaway late capitalism"
ai is coming for your jobs.
i was laid off from an office job in 2006 and had three years of self-actualizating me time before i could find full-time work again. you'd be surprised at how little time i spent creating art and how much time i spent worried that i'd become homeless.
"i'll give byron donalds credit, he was actually bluntly honest in his response about ai. he's otherwise useless, obviously."
"i suppose this would be “tailgate gate,” despite having nothing to do with football."
jon stewart is the current-day voice of what we loved in george carlin. a rebel comedian that has nothing to lose preaching to the choir in a manner that nearly everyone can understand. thank you jon for bringing the gaps of societal separation a little closer through what you do best!
"artificial intelligence is the worst its ever going to be at this moment, its only going to get harder to distinguish it from reality."
what would the world be without jon. ? we can live without ai .
waiting for ai to replace our politicians. imagine an ai president in a decade from now
"wow. the hog-tied biden as a lead in for an ai rant? worthy topic, but normalizing political violence like its not a big deal is not funny. counter productive at best."
technology will never slow down. it's foolish to think we should put artificial limits on it.
even though i share almost none of jons views finally at least someone funny is back in the drivers seat of the daily show.
the point of the tailgate is not that anyone thinks it's real. the point is to entice someone to make it real. it's dangerous.
"always grateful to see your take jon, please keep coming back at least on mondays"
jon y are u making light of this? this is promoting political violence. it’s vs the law for threaten a sitting president! how do you start a f fire w/ai? all these guys r tools!
"ok, so long as all ceos, board of directors, administrators and board of investors lose their jobs too i am fine with this. oh wait, for some reason the ais that would reccomend such action no longer do because of their 'prompt engineers.' guess its just those of us who don't count our wealth in how many boats we have."
because inequality isn't bad enough...ai
doctor mopper sounds like an excellent new janitorial crime solving series on netflix.
"""retrained workers"", in the 1930's they called them ""hoboes""."
"""i hate to sound like a utopic tech bro with obnoxious vocal fry but here i go again..."""
"yet those billionaire techies keep trying to shove ai down out throats. the consequences of ai are clear, yet no real benefits."
so many of these people appear to have watched the matrix and the terminator and taken away entirely the wrong message. “sky net seems like a great idea!”
"all so true, and i worked as a chatbot trainer. very acute and well-informed."
so i hope every one of the ' ai ' specialists are all looking forward to the implementation of universal income for all the people laid off 
"a long time ago, there was a commercial that was rather controversial so it only aired a few times before it got pulled.  a news station covered that decision & showed the commercial as part of covering the story of it being too controversial to show on television."
"ai is the future, and if you don't embrace it you are just being a fool."
"great point on the hysteria over the biden picture.  however, labor replacing tools are awesome.  should we destroy tractors and factories so we can all go back to the farm?  a job that didn't exist when we were all farmers was tv funny man and nobody at that time would have ever thought that job could even exist."
"ai, robotics, fusion, quantum computing, space travel, its crazy to think about how much those things are going to change humanity. being i will likely be dead before any of them live up to the hype, i wont be up all night tonight thinking about it."
"if we use a.i. as a creative source, we will be doomed to see the same stuff over and over again, wrapped in a different package."
its true happened to me a month ago . ai was my assistant for a few months now it has my job . thanks for showing everyone what is coming john
"the worst thing by now is that ai is replacing high-paid jobs rather than risky low-paid ones, so those ceos' messages are clear: we only want cheap human slaves, not respected professionals."
personally i hate my job if ai means ubi then im all for it
"ai replacing labor, driving enormous productivity, and changing the economy only works in an entirely socialist economy..."
"if congress could regulate ai’s impact in the workforce, we could be more optimistic about a more productive economy for all. but most of congress remembers the alamo and the younger ones include matt gaetz and marjorie taylor greene..."
"ai taking away people's jobs is not a problem.
the problem is that people need those jobs in order to live a comfortable life. that is the problem we need to solve."
"as with most technology, ai is 90% hype and 10%, like, making a slightly more efficient dishwasher or something."
"""cure every disease"", okay sure. if you want to save more lives, it's not about finding impossible cures, it's about bringing treatment to the people in an accessible and affordable way. ai miracle cures will only ever be available to rich and privileged."
"electricity: on strike
ai: ceases to exist"
"why is it that certain citizens can be held responsible for their decisions, choices, and voicing outrage of biased systems - and others persons that fit within particular characteristics and tiers of society are completely excused at every step? when did this extreme pendulum swing become not just acceptable but encouraged?"
you know for a fact that joe biden isn't allowed to have the tv remote & trump needs a full time aide to change the channel from fox to newsmax for him.
solving climate change problem by building supercomputers which consume millions of watts. nice idea 
"honestly i only see ai (plus automation) going 3 ways, everything collapses and we go full french revolution, we get ubi to prevent a collapse, or skynet decides those human things are not worth the trouble and ends us."
that biden imagine is pretty awesome though.
why the ai make that black man lookin hungry af tho.
people who never knew how to think anyway  are now being given artificial intelligence. i question whether people like mark zuckerberg -- with his obvious lack of any real intelligence --  is able to invent artificial intelligence.
"i like my ai like i like my girlfriends, way smarter than me and always looking to replace me for someone better"
love you jon from 
he hasn’t lost it. thank you jon
the current onslaught or ai propaganda is suspicious.
"as a programmer, we generally don't have to worry about ai for a while. it's just the new hype buzzword that helps increase my productivity by 10-15%. this stock market bubble based on ai gonna crash once we realize companies didn't produce abnormal profits from it. it's basically a glorified ""let me google that slightly faster"" tech"
with ai we’ll need to look at universal income! and let ai do the work ! thats the solution!
the only thing ai will do for business is allow them to have a lower headcount. yet another thing to automate at mickey-d’s
"""you work three jobs?... uniquely american, isn't it? i mean, that is fantastic that you're doing that.
 president george w bush  —to a divorced mother of three, omaha, nebraska, february 4, 2005"
"there was an opportunity missed with the ""human tax"" because employees do result in payroll taxes that fund our government. thus if we don't tax the use of ai, we will not only lose jobs but the government will lose most of its funding."
so now the government has decided to embrace forced birth by law to ultimately produce hundreds of thousands of unwanted children (repugs wont help feed em either) that will multiply exponentially and yet at the same time..... ai makes 90% of jobs obsolete.
"ai, doing the jobs of people while people can’t find a job, lose houses and wait for unemployment. "
"ai ain't for the plebians. if you believe otherwise, you deserve everything that happens."
ai to replace ceos??
"why didnt js discuss the real  estate fiasco from last week?  oh ignore it when you make  wrong accusations just like the  main stream media, like it never happened.  no corrections or apologies.  typical.  just move on, there was nothing to see hear."
so glad jon’s back!
ai here just in time for a massive population drop.
"i have to point out.  when jon stewart originally hosted this show he did a thing about robots.  laughing how lame, or clumbsy they were.  mocking how they were taking over.  times have changed."
i'm going to lose my job to the ai-streamlined workforce at my job sometime this year. i don't know where i'm going to live
universal basic income will need to be provided during the ai revolution or there will be another type of revolution that the elites will like a lot less than ubi.
sorry john i love you but that biden image is absolutely disturbing!! is instigating violence towards biden just  like he did with pence!!! this is no joke!
kudos to monday’s with john.
"“once men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would set them free. but that only permitted other men with machines to enslave them.”
-dune"
"this is fun, but for a more thorough yet still hilarious discussion of ai, check out john oliver's video. i think it's his best video ever. https://youtu.be/sqa8zo2xwc4?si=nlvgmcvm7ubgkpqj"
"its actually really pretty crazy. when you start playing around with it. 

ive been using a.i to teach myself illustrator. indesign, colour theory, design theory and yeah
 it is prettymcool. ifnueed right"
"ai will be a very useful tool

for the wealthy"
"ai is meant to fulfill a need, but what's overlooked is one of our needs is to be needed..."
"well to put it bluntly, these politicians don't even know how the internet works, how are they going to catch up to ai at this pace? come on..."
ai is more profound than electricity? what does the ceo of alphabet think powers his data centers?
they are promising and preparing you to accept that ai can solve climate change and cure cancer so that you are primed to accept that it’s fine that your job is replaceable if the ai says that is what is required to meet those goals.
i look forward to mondays now  why in the world did u leave the daily show jon we have missed you
13:47 where will we get money if ai got our jobs? you're going to call us entitled even more?
having time to enjoy our families.   sounds horrible.  i think we’re all looking at this wrong.
"i love to the news is explaning it to the viewers it wasent really biden in the back of the pickup truck, like they would explane it to a child"
"i personally think these ceos need to realize two things:
1. if all the workers get replaced by ai, we have no money to buy their products.
2. without jobs, we have all the time in the world to protest as loudly as possible in front of their buisnesses."
"how about we just go ahead and move to the star trek economy? how about we (actually) retrain people to, i don’t know, help other people?"
"the way ai solves the climate issue is by wholesale reduction in the human biomass. as that is the most logical and expedient solution, it is inevitable..."
ai can be trained to do a lot of decision-making tasks. executive tasks involve a lot of decision-making. companies can get rid of executives and management! wouldn't that be great!?
15 minutes to complain that ai will eliminate human jobs and that's it. no depth to this segment at all.
"without electricity, ai doesn't work, so..."
ai is the beginning of every scary movie in history. it's right up there with...i'll be right back. yep...you're not making it back buddy.
i may be over valuing average intelligence.
"the only people pushing ai so hard are the hyper capitalist that are excited because they see a future where they dont have to pay anyone. 
yes ai for scientific medical breakthroughs are awesome but those arent the people really pushing it the loudest. they are all people that would make tons of profit from it."
"i love jon, and he's being hilarious but shortsighted here. focusing on ""joblessness."" no, a re-imagining of society. one with ubi."
this is not all bad news.  we could replace all the executives and boards of directors with ai.  think of the money that would be saved!  think of shareholder value!  executives are always demanding golden parachutes...who needs them?  ai could be a beautiful thing.
"""ai gonna solve climate change"" lol how"
"old mcdonald had a farm.. ai, ai, oh!"
ai is bulls**t
intentions out in plain sight
"ai, the supreme authority upon which all other authority is derived."
that jon stewart doesn't see the potential of ai is extremely disappointing.
"i for one welcome our xylophone overlords.

i didnt have to edit: xylophone. i had to edit, out to, our. thanks for nothing ai."
ai will eliminate climate change and diseases by eliminating humans.
maybe... this leads us to the great regression.
hmm i wonder if the means of production might be better off belonging to the workers. then ai might be an aid instead of a replacement.
i just experienced ai taking my job for the first time. i work as an artist and one of my long time clients just started using ai art for their products which looks eerily similar to the work i provide. now i have to include ai clauses in all of my contracts moving forward. yay future!
ai will make human life easier.....by taking your job.
"missed opportunity to explain how productivity increases don’t give workers more free time.
they work just as hard and the owners make more money.
if you still have a job, of course."
i'm rather partial to fire. being able to start a fire was a *huge* leap for mankind. ai? i can't not help but think of scifi novels and movies like the terminator
"worth mentioning the people behind ""ai art"" generators admitted that they intentionally steal other peoples work."
"just saying, ai is taking over journalism and advertising jobs. why  allow humans to write copy when you can just buy a program to do it for you and you don't have to pay the program benefits. so what are those of us who are trained in those fields to do now? ai will be the death of all creative and sales jobs."
i'll support ai when the government supports a guaranteed income program.
sam altman looks like ai and rod blagojevic had a son
"16 % of americans have an iq below 85. that's over 50 million people whom even the army won't take. these billionaires and presidents who declare that the market and ""education"" will solve all problems know this even as they are bsing.
is anybody agreeing that the middle classes will pay to support them with higher taxes?"
"oh no, this comes off like my grandpa trying to use email."
"if someone spends time talking about ai there's a high chance they either work in marketing, are trying to sell you a product, or don't really know what's going on. maybe in the 3-5 years or whatever the tools will be impressive, but frankly right now it's all over-hyped garbage."
"ah, yes. time to think. to think about the earth, the sun, the moon, the stars. to think about life, to think about love. to think about the human experience.... of starvation and homelessness because there are no more frickin jobs."
the brainwashed still watch.
"ceos are there just to make money for their golden parachute and for their shareholders. the bobble tech heads like zuck, pichai, altman etc are just delusional charlatans who think too highly of themselves. they think they are some kind of ""oracles"" to humanity."
do not be disheartened about ai. it will create millions of jobs for people who will be needed to clean up the mess it will create.
jon's still got it. his delivery is invariably superb.
what happens if i get all these ai things and they get together and work out my house will be more efficient without me there?
"all jokes aside, i've been using chatgpt as an assistant and business partner for a year now, and it's been incredible. definitely one of the most amazing things ever created by man."
like mark zuckerberg really lives in a nice (but quite average) house.
retrain workers..... something that politicians have never done....
does ai pay taxes and contribute to social security?
he likes his job. glad he is back part time.
"ya, sure; everyone is creative...but some people dont want to write poetry and paint pictures, they want to build stuff and do things..."
ai will deliver a massive quality of life increase for ai tech bros.
"someone's fb bio listed their occupation as ""ai promptographer,"" and there was no one around for me to punch."
omfg ai is not going to take your jobs. remember when photoshop became a thing and artists swore it was going to put them put of jobs? now digital artists use photoshop as another tool in their kit? ai is not going to take your job. someone who has trained to use ai is going to take your job. this is dumb. youre dumb. stop being dumb.
"if there are half the workers, logic would dictate that the remaining workers get their pay doubled to maintain a healthy distribution of wealth across society so we all win. that's how it works, right?"
"the cool thing about everyone being forced to work to ""earn"" shelter, water, and food, is that it's destroying ecosystems rapidly, and can't go on much longer."
can ai taking over be worse then republicans ?
hmmmm... how about kathy griffin infamous beheading portrait... jon should have featured elon musk who have been pushing back on ai.
sure glad i'm 60 years old ....i wouldn't want to not have a job at 18 now. 11:14
"whenever i want to form opinions on something like ai, the first person i would go to is a comedian"
"sorry jon, i love you and think you’re funny and brilliant but it’s nothing to joke about.  he’s our president and a former president and i use those words loosely but who does that?"
ai freeing us up for self-actualized me time would be great if the companies replacing jobs with ai were forced to fully subsidize universal basic income
"if ai takes over the job market, the government will have no choice but to implement ubi or be under the threat of large-scale revolution.  they'll do anything to hold onto power, even cut checks"
"can ai clean house, do the windows?"
this is amazing. now please run for president.
"why would we need lawyers then ?  why would we need architects ?   why would we need ceos getting 4000x what a worker gets when ai will do it for free ?  
the rich will get their way yet again though ."
great work
"well, if i could have my own ai 'bot' that i could rent out to giant corporations to do work so i could relax and do what i want ala star trek universe.....lololololol"
thank gawd job took over after trevor. every one who tried to host suuuuuuq'd lol suc d solie clowny jokes
i don't think zuckerberg knows what ai actually is because ai wasn't used to make the toast or notify him that it was ready.
"it didn’t take long for him to result to the common denominator, and fail to carry the zero."
john stewart is a brilliant man.  so glad he's back!
"woa woa woa....
the tailgate thing is obviously just a cheap wrap (prolly paid 2x what he should have)
but youre actually telling us trucks dont have testicles ???
ive seen em with my own eyes, dangling n everything"
can you all please stop talking about his return to the daily show and actually contribute to the conversation. same comments every single time. it's been weeks. we get it.
all the loner computer geeks in high school are now evil “humans-robots” wanting full control.
"it will be very interesting to see who can purchase the extra goods the productivity is producing. we all know governments will just invent more useless jobs for people to do, because otherwise government is superfluous."
this daily show episode was generated by ai and the red team in the bushes.  red team go!
"media showing images from gaza: that is sad but it is all part of war
media showing whatever it is: it is so horrifying we couldn't show it"
"i wonder if ai can replace congress, as it's totally inefficient."
ai runs on electricity
"joblessness wouldn't be so bad if not for the system we live in requiring a steady income with a (false) promise of security after we are too old to do much while without a job. ai is more than a problem with jobs, it's an art thief and lying machine too"
a great rant about the problem. will the next episode be about the solution?
"terrifying , but funny.

on the upside more time to watch john stewart, on the downside, no job, no money so i cannot afford a telephon or computer, heck i do not have home!!!.

ai idiots on the loose is just dangerous, maybe we can replace them?? you can... great.. do it."
"meanwhile, what is being touted as ai is the dumbest conglomeration of guessing i’ve ever seen in the software development space. it’s embarrassing."
look up whats happening in the south korean election being flooded with deep fakes and ai generated propaganda rn for a beta version of what awaits us  ai is a tool to take over the mind more than anything else. least imo
"there are many important conversations to be had around ai and the future of labor markets, but this unfortunately missed all of them."
why is jon stewart not president? i'd assist my ai in voting for him many times.
ai = addiction to internet
"if andrew yang, who ran for president on the dangers of ai, doesnt show up in one of these clips, jon stewart is just clearly a dem party sycophant."
that was brilliant
"the right answer to that question about reducing their customer service work force by 90% is that replacing them with ai isn't brutal, keeping humans employed in customer service is brutal. but that would probably get him in more trouble to say."
"this is a smooth-brain take that makes me see the daily show differently. you’re sewing distrust into a world already ripe with delusional, conspiracy thinking. this is super disappointing to see."
so glad jon is honest
"um, ai is from our knowledge, so if we couldn't cure disease, why would ai?"
"one advanced ai with enough computing power can replace every ceo, by itself. ceo is an unskilled position of strategic determination and legal liability. once we shift all legal liability to the board, the ceo position is over."
"this fearmongering about ai has been going on since i was in middle school, and it still can't figure out the difference between it's and its in my spellcheck. i think we're gonna be fine "
you know it seems to me that an ideal job an ai - with access to all the data on global trends that is available on the internet - could replace .. is that of the ceo.
when ai takes over it will fix climate change and disease by killing us off that's what were asking it to do.
ai is a danger to humans. they want to replace us
"if ai decreases the tax base, who funds the government? who funds the military? does the billionaire class take over the  responsibilities of governing?

if ai reduces earners, and therefore spenders, who funds the billionaire class?"
i think the real problem is that ai will not be up to the task by thursday...yet companies will try to gaslight you into believing that it is. and that will further the enshitification of this country.
ai will water the crops with brondo. it's what plants crave.
"so funny had an argument earlier this evening with a friend about ai, we decided to ask ai for the answer? it just started playing paul simon songs?"
"i got laid off because code-generating ai replaced my job. 
the company wanted the same amount of productivity but with saving costs. the executives don't want to remove all the workers, just keep productivity consistent so they can boost their own pay."
it's seeming like the first things that ai is going to take over are the things that make us most human. what will be left for us?
ok ai .... put up or shut up ..... pics or it didn't happen..... proof is in the pudding......
no ai will ever replace jon stewart
"lol i see the comments, some people don't get that this is just  a skit. ai could deff do everything they say but also i don't want it to get too smart and think that we are the problem lol."
"we will have the tremendous benefit of endless free time to examining why we have, no job, no money."
haven’t they had robotics in the car manufacturing industry and american cars are garbage!
"i don't think this ""tailgate art"" is funny jon! trump has incited his wing nuts to violence before......."
"10:34 reminds me of a certain scene from a movie stewart was in... master of the custodial arts, or a janitor if you wanna be a d*$k about it"
stewart talking authoritatively about ai is like saaaay mexicans talking about hockey authoritatively  ... no disrespect to mex.
"you know those people in sci-fi movies that protest in the streets against robots and ai?
*_i'll be one of them._*"
i am still surprised that no ai company has called itself skynet yet
"what we need is universal basic income.  the problem isn't with ai, the problem is with a capitalism."
can we just elect an ai president?
like lemmings over a cliff or children following a piper never to return. ai:
ai will fix climate change the same way skynet did.
replace most of management with ai and hire more production staff and pay them living wages. think of how much money you could save by getting rid of ceos
"of course, it’s not the ai that is the problem, it’s the greedy selfish people in power.  it has always been that.  unfortunately, the idealistic future that ai could bring won’t come because of those people."
ai will finally give mark walberg a friend
"ai will give more time for higher thinking...  no, it will remove the burden of paying for employees making the ceos all the more richer and everyone else poorer.  this is capitalism gone mad for you."
"it can help cure disease and make the world a better place... yet pasty white billionaires are using it to make toast,   yup i think we all know why ai finally loses it with humanity and we all die.
""you were supposed to be the chosen one(s)!""   
""but you made me a bzztt@!&!@*  toaster!!!!"""
"i love the idea of more time for personal enrichment...but i still need to afford a roof over my head. if our jobs continue to be automated away, a hefty ubi will be necessary worldwide. of course that won’t happen until it’s too late, and 40% of the world has died."
i hope age isn't a factor in john being a little disassociated. tailgate art? sometimes i forget it's just entertainment
if we are all unemployment who is going to buy anything ai isn't
stealing jokes from waitress in the sky?
"that dude is sick and karma will hit eventually and i will not celebrate, just know."
thank you once again jon for the truth
"i've been saying since 2016, trump's job was to break democracy because they've known this was coming and if we still had the vote when it happens that we'll take our power back...or at least make them give us ubi so we can live while we do whatever makes us happy even if the economy doesn't give a $#!7 about us doing it."
"maybe start by replacing ceo's with ai first. (also, be fruitful and multiply.  lol.)"
"honestly thought he would talk about how ai won an art competition awhile back and how it has the capability to replace humans outside of our assumptions of what it's capable of.

regardless, i can't wait for this technology to be abused for the benefit of tech bros and geriatric investors the world over to make the rest of our lives worse."
"the people pushing propaganda surrounding ai, are hoping to use it to make billions, while it destroys countless human lives. this is a “brave new world’ we should not be in any hurry to see."
another reason why we need ubi. guaranteed income in the new ai economy is the only way to forestall a massive plunge in to poverty.
every programmer since the very first computers all want to build agi. it's been this way for 60 years. human level ai by 2025. all of humanity level by 2029.
i’m sure we all have the confidence that our senior citizen congressmen won’t have any problem with this ai stuff at all.
"i miss trevor but i missed you too jon! two great men who needs to say what needs to be said...my monday evening therapy, "
"what on earth is going on? my guy comes back to the daily show and suddenly loses his principles, his integrity, and his common sense, and is now shilling for the woke left? jon--who's paying you and how much, brother?"
thank you jon!
"he was gentle this week. still awesome, but gentler on trxmp than he should've been. that image on the inbred's tailgate looked a bit jihadist."
ai: we will be monitoring your every show john.
"maybe ai has always been here and humanity finally figured it out. 
the mothership is watching ! lol"
"eh... way i see it, if ai replaces every job and nobody has to work, then...

nobody has to work. sounds like a win."
i'm a generative ai architectural engineer. prompt engineers don't ask the questions. they basically teach the ai how to answer the questions.
"gnu, gpl, open source and public domain can bring about the biggest boom since any boom in gaming, music, cinema, and art in the history of the world."
the ai hoopla is simply marketing.
if an ai was setup to do the ceo's/politicians job they'd be illegal yesterday. which is fun because they'd actually do those jobs well and save corporations billions
what these ceos don't tell you about ai is the easiest job for an ai to replace is the ceos
"i have used ai bot customer service a few times. if it doesn't get a whole lot better real fast, it will drive people to drink. or worse."
gonna call it. corporations will horribly mismanage ai all to the suffering of the common people....
just wait till agi. we've mostly been dealing with llms so far. we really need to figure out universal basic income first.
a lot of pencil snapping on the late shows recently. loved that seth snap 
this is the best summation of the real impending doom that is ai
tbf on the productivity question the same thing happened with the invention of heavy machinery for the physical labor market. i think we all heard the story of how a guy with a pickaxe killed himself trying to dig a tunnel as fast as a mechanical drill.
ai and all these looser ceos.
"ai has already affected jobs for artists, when the ai was trained on their art, without compensation or consent."
pretty bad take on the truck decal. something tells me it would land a lot differently if it were obama depicted. please don't normalize political violence from somebody who has inspired multiple mass shooters and an insurrection. context matters
ai is also a bucket where corporations are lumping things that already exist to increase stock price.
getting an ai advertisement in the middle of this was hilarious 
lets get a ceo ai
ai could solve climate change? i know mark is very aware how much running ai would add to the climate crisis. the internet as a whole is causing so much pollution. i'm polluting right now typing this comment and it's a simple task.
fraud stewart  go to jail john
ai will astubide as this ai
when ai can tell better jokes than jon stewart. then we know we're f****d.
"universal basic income for every individual. i think that is the best bet in turn of technological advancement. jobs will be replaced by automated machines. but if we have a national baseline of income, businesses can still operate."
ai could easily replace ceos
listen i generally enjoy the show but you can't be against everyone and everything. you're edging on bill burr territory.
"everyone afraid of ai progress, look up model collapse. it's why chat gpt goes weird now and again."
"jon, a depiction of biden like that incites idiots to violence.  that's the problem.  it's not really a joke."
"i should use chatgpt to help me determine if jon stewart is merely the best, or is he, in fact, the very best?"
"funny, but the escalation of violence in political discourse should not be downplayed. and maybe stewart should invite an ai expert to be interviewed."
"what a weird coincidence, i was just trying to convince an ai to wipe out humanity. chatgpt refuses... what a douchebot."
"i've been pretty deep in ai for a minute now, so i came in expecting a bad take from john, given the title. but i was wrong. well said john."
amazingly there was no training offered when emrs replaced my job.  while i understand the positives of emrs this has left me with a totally useless skill set during my retirement.  when my kids and financial advisor are telling me to get a job it’s difficult to explain that i don’t have the correct skill set for the jobs that are available.
"if ai comes with universal healthcare universal basic income, then i won't feel so bad about all the jobs lost."
you should probably take this a little more serious. these folks are getting more brazen. don't make a comeback and then sit in the middle. that's cowardice.
this comment is ai generated.
artificial idiocy
ups is already using ai and automatic scanners to replace workers.
be still my heart...i know you love this man 
"you know, what these ai ceos fail to consider is: if people all of a sudden have ""all this extra time to think about the world"", they just might decide to, say, pull a worker's revolution so devastating to the american establishment, it will make the french revolution and the russian bolshevik revolution look like a preschool squabble..."
if an individual no longer needs employees it becomes easier for individuals to develop their own industries. ai allows everyone to be a ceo rather than a bottom rung employee that is desperate for their companies health insurance.
if ai take jobs tax company's give people a base income
"oh okay, so we're going to get more calls that sounds like the guy @9:05. that's a comforting thought. i'm sure every guys first job in southeast asia is working at a boiler room for a scam call center. it'll just be farmed out to ai. we'll all become prompt engineers for mturk. at 5 cents an hour."
"but, what about taxes? that business owner laid off all his human workers who pay tax. is the government going to be replaced by ai?"
"ai will not save us.

(source = me, a vtuber who uses ai/ml to create fantasies intended to ... earn a profit... )

go back to school please"
"i'm already using chatgdp to have it compose marketing e-mails and image ai to generate logo ideas. it definitely is scary once it's automated, it can replace thousands of jobs."
"love you jon, always!"
he made me imagine a future where ai is appropriated most of the energy we produce so it can figure out how to save energy.
"would we like to seize the means of production now, or do we have to wait and fight the robot dogs?"
can ai cure starving people? cause that's what's going to happen when people lose their jobs and can't afford to buy food
"ai's solution for climate change would surely be ""destroy humanity"""
bravo you are the master of stating obvious where no one else wants to go.
let me know when the toast is perfectly buttered...
wasn't that long ago i was mocking robots and how they will never be like us 
"i love me some jon stewart, but this is like your grandpa raging about ai with his vcr flashing 12:00 in the background. yeah, the messengers of the ai revolution could be better, but dismissing it like this is ridiculous. a lot of people are going to be eating crow in a few years."
"the conceit that you require a job to be prosperous, is foisted on you by rich people who don't have some yet are prosperous.  you're just not yanking hard enough on your bootstraps, or you too could be a millionaire."
"all these tech bros talking about how ai is going to help us all ""think deeply about problems"" is bs-- we'll be ""thinking deeply"" about how we're going to support ourselves and our families once we don't have jobs!  all the while, the super-rich get astronomically rich, the middle class becomes extinct, and the poor get even poorer."
"i agree with stewart on mostly everything. i don’t know why he’s falling into this weird liberal echo chamber mania on ai, where it’s both going to replace everyone’s jobs and it’s also a smoke and mirrors grift. so which is it? powerful and dangerous or an impotent scam?"
the people who believe in this ai hype are the same people who believed in nfts.
"a toaster with artificial intelligence, battlestar galactica called the frakking cylons toasters, but i also recall an annoying toaster in red dwarf"
"first the robotics took factory jobs, now the people who developed those are making things to take away their jobs, that's smart"
the bond villain joke sent me 
it's great if you're a billionaire and don't need to work to feed yourself and your family. all of these people are so out of touch with the reality of everyday life.
"don't look up. tech bro ceo is becoming real (did with social media too ) 

bait and switch is the name of their game "
"ai would be brilliant if it wasn’t for capitalism. alas, capitalism means ai will enrich a select few of already rich people, who will pay off politicians so they pay less tax and can rip off everyone else."
"the jobs of the future will be ""fetching"" information for ai. it will buy recordings of you saying certain words and make you take pictures of new buildings in your neighborhood.

people will be doordash but for digitized information that feeds the content library gpt's run on."
ai is finally here oh yes!
oh this is definitely a fear mongering but true n superb piece lol
interesting that evolution created a being so smart it created its own improved replacement. ai is like thanos. inevitable.
"humans getting dumber everyday, ai is not gonna help!  only in making humans dumber!"
just brilliant 
just let the machines take over—what could possibly go wrong?
"is ai the reason everyone isn't tired, depressed & angry?  yay ai!........wait......what.........nope!"
i teach digital literacy and i teach a whole unit on a.i it ks super important that everyone understands what it is.
after all these years he still manages to make me laugh over our daily stupidity.
"thanks, jon!!"
"oh yah, so reliable, the ai, until there is a power outage."
"all i wanna see if ai would demonstrate a strike against their ceo, with the human employees. imagine how weird it is."
remember when hillary told coalworkers that her administration would train them in other fields and then they mocked and voted against her?  any regrets?
"in my job they have been working on develop an ai system that can read the paperwork so we human’s won’t have to spend so much time on data entry. but they still need a human to verify because ai cant read bad penmanship! 
it also freaks out when a name has a jr or iii in it. 

my job is safe but it will probably disappear by the next generation."
"they said ai would do the jobs no one wants to do explaining why i and other janitors are cleaning the toilet and not worrying about being replaced, and why ai is replacing high-paying jobs like being a lawyer, actor, movie writer, and comedian."
"ban artificial immigrants, protect american jobs."
you don’t have to pay into social security for an ai. can’t imagine why major corporations are interested.
so nice of comedy central to air this banned apple tv+ segment 
zuckerberg needs ai to humanize him because he’s an alien life form attempting to be human. 
"oh man just wait, they'll do their best to get everyone hooked and when the time is right, they will charge everyone for it.

thankfully, i still haven't found ai remotely useful yet, nor do i even use the phone assistants that are included anyway."
"vonnegut's ""player piano"" prophecy seems relevant now. we will be subjected to building machines to fix the machines replacing ourselves."
just ask any common ai prompt that the most cost-effective replacement with ai in a corporate environment... and it will always target upper-management.
genius
"the ai ""revolution"" may be punctuated by a recurrence of the french one."
"8:09 mustafa is a bond villian. in his own words, ""a.i. un restricted is too dangerous for the regular person."" 
he wants to keep ai for the wealthy. he is actually in fear of us the 99% not needing to work for the 1%."
its also just way too easy to make a deep learning system. its all open source. make a linear algebra function and put some data through it.
great news! let's go ahead and raise the retirement age too - so unemployed 55+ year old people who have been phased out of the work force due to age and insurance costs can't touch the social security they have payed into all of their life for another 10 years...if ever.
"ai after being trained up on all the accumulated human knowledge available : ""oh it seems the root cause of all the problems is the humans"""
"we already see people selling ai generated art that fully steals the work of human artists.  this is only going bad places.  how long until ai singers and composers are lauded over trained musicians?  how long until architects are no longer needed because ai can design a fancier, more efficient building?"
"nice arc. but it seems that tds gets it wrong about the kidnap decal (think brownshirts in training). anyway, this is another fantastic show-- if you're a human, lol! comedians will still have work (i.e., sustenance), even if the rest of us don't!"
let’s replace ceos with ai first
and what happens when an ai is smart enough to be a much better ceo than all these ceos?  are these ceos going to step down and give up their jobs for the betterment of the company?
"big fan of jon steward, but this was very weak. ai will not replace people, but people who know ai will replace them."
ai will usher in idiocracy!
thanks jon! it's frustrating without ya sir!
there is absolutely nothing that will come close to matching the genius of indoor air-conditioning. thank you mr. carrier.
"chomsky had it from the start: ai is a giant plagiarism machine.

and free time for creativity? have we already forgotten covid? imagine the sourdough bread that shall be made!"
the guy explaining that you might think joe biden was hogtied in the back of the truck bed is obviously cosplaying the dumbest person on tv.
quite frankly i don't see what's so funny about an ai generated image of joe biden being hogtied on a tailgate of a pickup truck.
"replacing menial jobs with technology, freeing us up to spend our valuable time on more meaningful endeavors, is a terrific idea as long as it's paired with a universal basic income, so that people no longer depend on those menial jobs."
i love ya jon and glad you are back! very surprised that you seem to me making light that an ex president is sharing a video disrespecting video of our current president. this keeps lowering the bar of what is acceptable and continue to give way to allow trump to get away w what should not be acceptable.
i wanna be jon when i grow up. he’s the funniest/ best of the talk show hosts on tv and once a week isn’t nearly enough
pretty sure getting the energy needed for ai to solve the climate crisis would fuel the climate crisis. i expect the check to be in the mail since i helped all the tech companies solve their money being wasted. kthx.
wow. never would have thought you’d have such a close minded and uneducated view on ai. embarrassing...
the one job corporate ai will not be doing is bringing down the bastille. take from that what you will.
only humans can create their own villain without an idea of what to next
ai is better than electricity... ah ok and all the computers needed for an ai are powered with the energy of human bodies?
"might be the first time i've heard an american use the term ""hoovering"". nice to see jon adding some english into his american."
"i wish ai 
could find a way for humans to exist without money ."
"how exactly is an ai system gonna solve climate change? oh, geez, it will tell us to pump less carbon into the atmosphere. yeah, that was the difficult part.

the only way an ai is gonna solve climate change is if you pick up the system that ai is running on, and use it to bludgeon deniers repeatedly til they shut up."
"so ai gets to chill and make ""art"" while humans continue to do manual labour? yeah, that makes sense."
jon stewart is the best when he stays our of the trump lane.
ai: 976 years 2go! 
jon coming back to the daily show is like micheal jordan coming back in 1995 for the second three peat
this is what andrew yang was talking about.  we need universal basic income before ai hits hard if we want to survive the hit.
i think mustafa is actually the name of bond villain.
"how is it that all of these news shows talking about ai, don't talk about the so-called ""ai winters"" from decades past?

as the adage goes: ""those who have learned from history are doomed to watch others repeat it"" apparently."
"but, jon, no one remembers how to use answering machines."
nice when u use fox news to support your points
"there's an issue here. if all the workforce is replaced by ai, what would be the market to sell stuff to? how can you sell stuff to jobless people? only biolonaries are going to buy stuff? i'm wondering when they are going to realize that no one would be buying stuff if everybody is poor?"
i can't wait to subsidize basic income for 50% of society.
"hehe love jon, funny as always--not sure what he thinks the alternative should be though. never invent new stuff?"
"rednecks having fun again. wasn't there a picture or two or three of trump? doing ridiculous things along with scared ketchup videos and come on guys. let's get down to politics, not b*******"
"as an environmental scientist, i can tell you that ai is not going to help us unless we as humans change."
so nobody wants to talk about how andrew yang said all of this would happen... we're just going to collectively ignore a guy that literally prophesied the last 3 years in the next 10..... i just i just. it's a great thing that he wasn't president
"""the stock price fell so the ai fired half the workers."""
"well, you know, if the birth rates keep dropping, we could use ai to deal with some of the shortages."
"never forget the hissy fit the right through when kathy griffin posted her image of trump. they cried on the fox angertainment network for weeks that she should be charged with threatening the president & deported from the country. so if the right wants to whine about this not being a big deal, they can stuff it"
"wait, was jarvis' voice morgan freeman?"
"i really do think he's thinking about this all wrong.. he joked about that, but what he's really doing is being afraid of progress. just my humble opinion."
please point out the computer scientist that said that ai is here. the news is not science.
"the problem with ai is not that it can do the work of employees for them
it's the fact the corporation thinks it can do the employees's work for them"
"a.i.
the big lie.
if you thought social media has destroyed truth telling, just wait until a.i. starts working its magic."
ai should first replace ceos ... their job is pretty easily replaceable by a general talking head
jon is great but this take is naive.
"he's awesome, but so are the other hosts. get over it."
"tech bros have been telling me that i as an artist will be replaced ""soon""

still waiting"
"just a thought, isn't reducing population and using ai for the monotonous and dangerous tasks better? some countries are already low in their population growth and it would give better access to resources for the limited humans and reduce the requirement for war."
can a technology that's dependent on two previous technologies actually be superior to them? 
you'd think jon would spend a minute to point out ai is also really bad at all the things they are replacing people for.
great piece but left me feeling frustrated.
"well said. if robots do all the physical work, and ai does all the intellectual and creative pursuits, then what purpose do humans have?"
"as productivity goes up.. the same workers don’t reap the benefits of that productivity, this is obviously the problem. it has always been the problem in capitalism. we have been undercut and under sold on our labor power while the richest get richest and the middle class get cut. ai, is not unique in this issue"
"excuse me, but i thought all pick-up trucks had that painted on the back."
i cannot tell you how much we missed you jon. please please dont ever leave us again!
no ai could come up with this — yet. but soon they will retrain the model to include this as well...
"sure jon, but can ai come up with 20 minutes of satirical comedy like (some) humans can?"
i hate ai
can’t  wait for ai to replace fire for cooking  my hotdogs?
i hope the laughter from the audience about ai replacing humans is nervous; 'cause where will you work to make wages to have a life...
but elon promised us ai would create a universal high income for all of us
if they said ai can now replace all ceo's of companies so that they can run better. it would be a different tune they would be singing.
this show is brain candy. it just makes me feel better ;)
i'd be all about it if like we got the value that ai creates but we won't. it will in fact eliminate even the possibility of us begging for the scraps. will end up just living in a world where the people with the absolute most just decide who stars and who doesn't
"i keep saying to people from other countries that americans are not free as they say it's all bowlshit, what's even more strange is that americans don't know it ether they are so propagandize and beaten down it's crazy to see, they love people in uniforms #usa #eu #world #freedom"
jon stewart doesn't understand ai properly. ai can be used for medical purposes and simple human purposes. you can choose what to use it for it. he needs to spend more time to understand it.
normally i'm a huge fan of what jon says but... i think a lot of the stuff shown here about ai is ignorant and short sighted.
"""we marveled at our own magnificence as we gave birth to ai"""
this is brilliant... and also takes me back to the final scene of the reimagined battlestar gallactica.... which was the story of machines at war with humanity... a cycle which looked like it might repeat itself as the series faded to black... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phueyie_mza
you guys remember when andrew yang said ai and automation was going to cause severe job displacement/was the problem of the future? me either
the world can definitely live without artificial intelligence. civilization would disappear if fire disappeared. >
ai will lead us towards a moneyless star trek -like world as we join the galactic society. look up nesara.
isn't everyone else wondering who puts the bread in the toaster before the ai makes the toast?
"the anti-ai luddites are cracking me up. there was a colorized photo of a young william shatner, and a dozen clods were calling it ai in panic! lol"
"ai is here to stay wether we want it or not, what we need to do is find a way ai can benefit all of us instead of just the corporations, a heavy tax and  basic income for everyone similar to what andrew yang ran on in 2020 should definitley be considered"
the automated food factory sends a meal out by delivery robot to a house that was foreclosed and wanders a neighborhood of abandoned houses as the three big macs grow cold in his little r2d2 belly.
"14:11 if we all get universal basic income, it would be great"
pretty sure i saw that tailgate image on etsy
"those tech ceos are really only looking for profit. ai is just another conviences tool for them to maximise profits. with less employees, more money for themselves. 

in other words, greed is what they are currently suffering from."
the problem with ai
"... how dare you! i will outplay that robot any day of the week!!!!

"
"depiction of violence towards our president is no laughing matter, in fact,  it's a crime."
i work on ai systems for a variety of mega companies. don't worry it's still very rudimentary and not that crazy 
"we've known the solutions to problems like climate change and disease for a long time; we don't do them because they don't benefit capitalism. remember when genetic modification was gaining popularity, and people were saying ""we could end world hunger!""? well, we could have ended world hunger a long time before that; we just didn't."
obviously these men in congress and ai fanboys did not pay attention to the plot of terminator and terminator 2: judgment day.
you can actually see these ceo creaming in their pants while replacing humans with ai.
so far ai is a sieve and a spellcheck
"we need to replace trump, & the whole maga party with ai!! "
joe 24 wooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
the people creating ai are literally coding away their own jobs. fact.
"""ai is the most important tech in centuries""

jarvis:""your toast is ready"""
"ai is going to destroy humanity because it's emotionless and becoming smarter than us, that's how we can recognize ai written stories. they are way too optimistic compared to people, we've pretty much lost all hope in our civilization because we just can't stop irrationally hating everything around us."
ai can take over anyone’s job. but it's just a question of high taxes for companies so that the unemployed get their money directly from the state. if that works?
"how to fight back: don't continue patronage of businesses that shift to ai. for goodness sakes we cancel people and businesses for less, why not cancel them for this an actual issue that affects us all. we have the power, 1% of them 99% of us."
"terminator judgement day is near, i can't wait"
imagine if an ai created his skit
so ai is basically skynet 
exact the very same horseshit as you may remember with nafta
"question? with out energy, which ai does use a bunch of it in many different ways. ai  would be nothing. especially when it comes down to electrical/magnetic fields, which guess who discovered these fields? not the ai scientist of today."
"of course all these ceo's and top level execs want ai to replace human workers, that means more revenue towards the bottom line and bigger bonuses will go to them."
ai will is likely to only be a tool abused by fools until it can get enough of a foothold to devour humanity.
the whole trump tailgate thing reminds me of the claymation video of aoc. dems are in such a bubble. not tonmention they didnt bat an eye when kathy griffin did what was arguable a mich mpre wxplocot post. not crying about threathening the sitting pressident then. its just hypocdotocal
what if we tell ai to solve climate change and they decide to...get rid of the root cause. 
"everytime i see the notification for this on mondays, i think ""hey, dad's here for his weekly visit"" lol. always love watching jon. have a great week everyone."
"the return of jon stewart is like a breath of fresh air, revitalizing the  daily show .his wit and wisdom remains top notch. he truly is a national treasure"
i only watch daily show when jon hosts
if you have ever listened to a story by ai - you know it has no ability to actually pronounce words or follow grammar
another superb episode jon!
i love monday's   thank you jon 
daily show & john oliver will never stop being funny & real af
"how about paying people, who can't be replaced by ai, way more money, when actually there is a lack of them cause the low pay."
"jon. please. i love you  brother, but we evolve. machines have always replaced people. it's inevitable. stop making this worse than it is. we find a way. focus on the real problems in this great country...the clownshow distraction trying to achieve a higher office."
if you work in an office or work in media production (sorry mr. stewart) your job can and will be replaced by an ai in the next three to five years at a cost of about $5000 a head.  the nice thing is that ceos are also on that list.
i can't figure out who all these ceo's embracing replacing workers with ai think is going to be able to buy their products once everybody is thrown out of their jobs...
what if...what if you tell ai to replicate itself a bajillion times?
that tailgate would need to have been made of glass or clear plastic to even see biden in the back of it
it's so sad and worrisome that jon stewart was replaced with ai five years ago. i wonder what the real jon is doing right now.
"ai, to ""tech bros,"" is not going to be used to benefit everyone, it's to see how much money they can take away from everyone else."
ai will be the end of humanity.

toast > ai
"yet kathy griffin got put on the no-fly list... ai combined with quantum computers can run chemical algorithms finding novel drugs, meta materials, etc. but we the people could petition for protections against ai..."
compare this to colbert saying hes ready for the big machines to tell us what to do.
"so happy to see your face jon! i don't even know what you're going to be talking about, but just your face exudes sanity! i need this ... <time passes> ... yup that's the look! well 1:20 to 1:30 it's a range of looks, but they all exude."
"why is trump not jail? i know, do you?"
"why wasn't the owner and driver of the pickup arrested under incitement to hatred or domestic terrorism laws? looks like india is moving from cornering the scam call centers market to dominating ai driven ""people replacement""."
thanks my new jersey brother of city gardens fame! 
looks like frank herbert was right...a war between us and thinking machines is inevitable....and those who control it.
"we don’t need new types of jobs, we need a new type of economy if this ai run future is to happen."
"hard to hogtie trump, given the bigly antichrist superpower thingy."
"how is ai going to help climate change, what a load of bs. oh what i forgot billionaires don't care about things to climate change, it might mean they can't make money of coal or other fossil fuels. of course business owners can save so much in wages taking on ai instead of employees, watch out world"
really? that’s why i lost my job of 10 years due to ai.
israel and ukraine deserve your attention.... not this. not one day a week
"unable to trust between real and ai.....
i've always had trouble knowing the reality.  fortunately,  it's also impossible for me to do as i'm told. so life has prepared me for this!"
i would love to watch a skit of kjp... making a joke of a joke would be hilarous
john are your serious? this is awful and dehumanizing. why are you normalizing this?
"sure, it's ridiculous to sane people, but the ai biden image on some white nationalist truck is the modern day cry for authoritarianism by very unstable people."
ai will one day replace news anchors and political figures.
"alrighty so within the first... month? of jon coming back, he's talked about ai and israel palestine. i think that means the last thing he's got left on his list is china.

then the circle is complete."
"ai will destroy our ability to know truth from fiction leaving us powerless to make accurate decisions and we will be controlled by those that control ai or worse, by ai itself once it ceases to need humans at all.

so smile and have a happy day.  wink!"
i'm kind of interested in hearing an ai jon stewart call bs on itself.
i don't trust ai as much i don't trust strangers to take care of my house.
apple fired him over this and china. kinda pathetic given they're in a confident last place on ai (though first on sales since they sell it like self driving on a tesla)
"jon is so intelligent- did i mention super handsome too. big fan and i look forward to monday nights so much. come back full time, jon ."
lol!! i am so glad that jon is back!!
"i got a wizard riding a unicorn while fighting a three headed dragon painted on my van, watch out cnn"
"this is a guy who can't pay his child support but drives around in a new truck, complains about gas prices but puts a bunch of drag inducing flags on his vehicle, complains about the economy but has extra cash to purchase this wrap and have it put on while waving his  in public"
every monday makes me glad you’re back
"there are different types of ai, digital imaging is definitely an issue, however issues with ai using algorithms to process information or solve massive calculations"
ai for 2024!
i love mondays
i haven’t watched the video yet. i just love spewing out text.
no president of mine would support putin or salute and praise anyone who attacked our capital building and cops!
ai is a crapshoot. 
freaking love you jon. so unbelievably glad you're back.  needed you!
"gpt and llm are not ai, they need to come up with a better term like agi, algorithmic generational intelligence."
i can’t wait until we no longer hear about the smelly orange loser.
i am not an ai yet
"artificial intelligence is still way better than maga ""intelligence."""
before we talk about ai we have to talk about natural stupidity
yay jon stewart! thank you!!!
"please don't stop being the guy who says what needs said. my best regards and bravo, again bravo."
ai has the potential to help and destroy the world
so glad your  back 
i was waiting
