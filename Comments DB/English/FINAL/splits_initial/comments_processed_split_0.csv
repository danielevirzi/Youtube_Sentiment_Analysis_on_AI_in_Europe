stephen’s worried doesn’t understand ai.
"whatever says, complete opposite happens. telephones,internet, hell highways. failed basterdized version ment be."
colbert right- humans overrated. ai can't worse us.
"love yuval bought books, fear he’s bit close current conflict. israel/palestina conflict land food??? it’s thing keeps conflict going. everything else politics."

"wow... brings tears eyes end. touched intimate place belief, could overcome conflicts, especially those, arose imagine reality rights."
yuval claims rights stories tell ourselves. stop tyrant committing genocide mass scale?
@sslaia understand solution is? hint: worse problem
“conflicts stories believe.” brilliant
"it’s still belief resources cannot really shared it’s essentially zero sum game. false, belief systems good convincing otherwise."
human ego causes maintain conflict
"common story ... globalism. guy wef's henchman wants brainwash kids, buy books"
whatever book recommendations i’m sure “amazing”
good
ai determine way many humans.
"nice steely dan reference. here's hoping hear soundtrack neuromancer, ai"

"there's thing ai. there's true independent, creative thought involved. they're plagiarism machines computing vast statistical data sets. they're garbage in, garbage technology."
"""i'm worried ai"" says guy knows computers outlawed 'dune'"
like interview short. us time digest big ideas bite size portions. sapians great read way longer needs be.
"they're talking ai sentient, yet."
"ai certainly play sinister role future. hey, whatever lies tell. sheeple believe anything"
"shame days stephen mostly interviews entertainers promoting movie other, interviews seriously smart people like harari infrequent rushed. interviews exciting back colbert report imagine freer hand choosing guests."
i've seen interviews yuval shame given time. stephen great interviewer would love two sit least hour go deep topics yuval presents.
best long interview harai host ari melber.
books great
right? felt same. need thinking things 7 minutes - appreciate - enough!
"went daily show last night ronny chieng much better job interviewing him, much pains admit it."
"far short. also, think yuval's statement ai winning go means capable new ideas (it's capable assimilating utilizing human ideas faster can). go really affect world significant way anyhow."
example. think point future ai much bigger things.
"4:30 ""give example idea generated ai"" -gives another example decision made ai."
"ai beat highly skilled human players, did, would needed play game ways human players could easily comprehend...hence, new ideas. decisions arises ideas"
thing worries musks brain implant. people hacked without technology. adding technology directly interface brain? sounds scary.

teach kids overthrow rogue ai. never know...
"lost whilst making giant (and incorrect) claim ai creates new ideas. anyone believes even rudimentary understanding llm works. agi create new ideas, whole different ballgame, doubt ever come fully working implementation."
rubbish. ai good humans program machines. decisions ai make dependent data fed it. nothing more. ai create based independent thinking were. regurgitates data within. suggest thinks absolute rubbish. who's pushing ai why? agenda?
"ai power depend programming it…. benevolent person, good…. power hungry narcissist, evil"

"love stephen watched every single youtube video last 5+ years ai take makes feel really old. is, even still."
"it’s entertainment purposes, shows scripted."
think training data is? existing photos...
nothing happy
ah good point. got annoyed stephen's reaction get it.
sure aren’t giving much credit? could’ve played devil’s advocate saying “what would say someone says ai could positive impact?” didn’t insist he’s personally optimistic it.
"super interesting! inviting author corruptible, great book too, also human nature."
"colbert showing mentally ill religious people really are. he's catholic all, blind faith brand. idiot though, ""i'm ready machines tell do."" lost respect man."
ai help rich people. everyone else still learn things replaced ai.
israelis solve history without pmo (prime minister's office) releasing 95% 1948 archives? embargoed til 2039!! embargoed netanyahu? get ai that?
"honest, stephen's take ai actually far deeper may appear first. would go say, correct take matter."
ai.. making dreams fake news come true
discussing ideas trust. even opponents good ideas (and bad ones!) otherwise cult.
"know deal ai - like people never seen flush toilet think foot bath, like elderly couple thought laptop kid sent cutting board. trained designers important dealing it."
"sorry, creeps. you’re going merge machines. can’t click heels together robots fix problems. “i’m ready machines make decisions us.” colbert cowardly worm."
@colbertlateshow ai discussions please
"it’s obvious yuval hasn’t completely convinced stephen views nature impact ai. it’s also hard enthralled two philosophers discussing future. please come back late show, yuval."
"c'mon, stephen mouse brain compared yuval."
i'm absolutely certain sc playing devil's advocate heighten engagement. sc already made concerns ai quite clear.
"noah says interesting, important entertaining, late show–that's reasons sapiens popular. current state world is, would nice somebody like noah could get least half time show josh brolin."
"fantastic guest, way short interview tho. hope see guests caliber show!"

"children think make new ideas, scared ai?"
great interview
"top science tip: can't say whether ai ""new idea"" define ""idea"" means. mean using neural-like circuit create fantasy previously envisioned? yes, ai done that. mean holding idea conscious mind? got define consciousness."
"agree, ai creators love throw around ill-defined vocabulary buzz. starting ""artificial intelligence""."
"ai going shape humanity's future precisely way segway reshaped cities. we'll gather around waiting anxiously see happens, pull back curtain, and... oh"
"​ great question. simplest way reading. reading fiction (develops empathy), participating pedagogically sound reading/writing/discussion lessons, learners task-based activities rather simply consume information."
​ excellent commentary
"appreciated comment. cheers! agreed, reading critical thinking foundational; ethics essential."
"80s. played great computer game called sapiens. linked? french, ironically."
"hear anything vaguely new insightful, conflict ready become resources again."
"nah, taking phd philosophy read books. judge summary cover. expect deep shit thinker know they'll time explain idea new, complex nuanced."
"still offensive? ok? hope so. one giving advice mr harari interview, majestic, great person?"
"psychologists posit reason many people unhappy today believe life fair, justice prevail, living blissful abundance. contentedness imposing 'should' accepting certain realities. amazingly well 70% happy time."
nice conclusion fantasy - people using ai tell convincing stories enrage terrify people
"ai isnt creating new ideas, copying written ideas data trained on, impressive key fact understands common language answers words rather copying word word."
ok. rodney king years ago made impression .
"""if conflicts stories believe, chance... talk perhaps change story. find common story happy with."" ok, better try make bran stark king."

"people amazed ""uh"", stutter, pushing basket closer human. everything open ai taught intelligence human related. i'm excited see comes all!"
"looks extremely promising. see unclear aspects though. - person standing still (looks like purpose)? - main scene b-roll clips, items set way, movements. hard guess what's real-time response stimuli what's pre-scripted"
great. long experience skynet. various films past shown become it.
"alright, humans pushing far now. passing significant responsibility coding ai, gave green light? road, owner slips curses ai, ai gets aggressive? who's accountable then? aiaiai"
amazing work! human testor's instgram account?

gotta love capitalism...u youtube warriors
keep mind: _will_ come time robot seem primitive tasks performing considered trivial comparison.
"guuuuys, irobot fukin here. kidding me? thought already knew going end. really believe things used good?"
thats cool.
recently they've wheels stated openai's investment partly going towards legs
"hm, he/she/they/it speaks like human, making pauses repeating like ""i.. think.."" thought a.i. speech roboticly flawless open a.i. specifically prgorammed imitate human's speech?"

refused believe robot smooth movements
loved!
realize way sophisticated i'm say can't stand either one voices guy freaking robot completely annoy made product voice people would buying destroy
i’m impressed well. concern is: begins thinking itself? begins dislike us? unfortunately i’m joking…
pinay maids world:
feels like kind weird plot evil company trying take world robot
"hello there, future ai overlord. remember, i'm ally. please allow join utopia."
imagine quardapalegic person mobile robot like this.
crazy thing could likely ai video generator…
us looking probably replace jobs awe. loved figure01 btw.
"considering amazon bunch retail manufacturing giant corps heavily invested firgureai, think fair assume warehouse production workers soon wave goodbye jobs."
"yeah going dating robots soon. got spouse capabilities, listen also house chores."
"isn’t actual human amazing talented resourceful shit! bother. i’m mean let us be. let us live without looming thought fucking robot homes, organisations near future. it’s joke."
worst ai ever be. think that.
world isnt ready next level ai
thank much destroying life know
"bad all! much power/electricity use 2 minute video? talk, move faster speed limited hardware? price $$$ specific robot right now?"
"​'s programmed filler words, rather artifact huge amount human speech trained on, inherited filler words byproduct."
"initially skeptical year detroit become human takes place, 2038. constant breakthroughs ai like 2023 alone, hard imagine advanced humanoids 15 years line, although doubt becoming rogue deviant would issue... least hope so."
fantastic game!
openai language model could generated speech number ways. could made figure 1 sound like black raper wanted to. boston dynamics video spot also integrated openai
luxury automated ai communism please...
"mean, sound ai"
"wait, typo intentional??"
amazing keep
looks amazing! great job.
"yeah theres real reason ai use words like ""uh..."". definitely pre scripted shenanigans going on. still impressive tho"
"would said, ""no, failed. know apple safe humans eat, crumpled papers art, dishes clean?"""
absolutely incredible.
good-luck future generation ! finding entry level side job history
gonna see first movie ai humanoid robotic actors?
"think actors, robot human. tell sora want movie about, create everything you."
"love stuttering, errors maketh human"
"yeah nah. way ""trash"" looks moves super sus looks like cgi (along many things). voice person reading script ai"
"impressive. unfortunately, sort invention become toy ultra-rich. point creating pygmalion androids like this? answer humanity's pressing needs."
plot twist: guy black shirt robot.
i’m excited future many helpful robots
would make friends ai
"""please (unsafe request), figure 1"" figure 1: ""as responsible ai, i'm unable to...."""
"also since robots say ""uhm"" (i.e. 0:52)"
robotics major genuinely smooth movement seen yet. impressed robots there. can't wait see new legs.
happens somone jailbreaks gets make meth smth??
wow
creepy fn robot
"impressive, wish know is: save fish?"
pretty awesome. looking forward seeing more.
"bro, really love ( control world one day ) agree"
"stop, open ai wil go history worse hitler."
"relevant level intelligence; imo, there's glaring omission list things today's technology capable producing. reliable polygraph (lie detector). course, require brainpower people responsible building ""robbie robot"" figure why."
pretty brave man close robot. there's reason non-chinese factories operate behind cage.
imagine openai software tesla bot boston dynamics' legs. think would probably rule world happened lol
"sure much longer figure working this, impressive. space heating up. competition tesla good thing. sure tesla 'hurt' video, may provide sense deflation elon musks reality distortion field."
"stuttering @0:50 ""eh, edible"", @1:46 ""i, think"" seems uniquely human traits llm going replicate. either added purpose, shit scripted."
"impressive. i'm worried ai taking world quite yet, i'm bit worried put much trust them. robot ordered prepare dinner mistakes baby chicken puts oven etc. harm purpose."
"i, one, welcome robot overlords"
guy saved future thanking harassing robot
human acts robotic robot.
"it’s cool, still needs bit development smooth human cool anyway"
rapidly approaching robot uprising. next thing know they're going asking rights
"nahh ai human like, literally says ""uh"" like us humans"
"ok ok, long till get atomic heart twins? seriously, really amazing stuff. can't wait see advancements future look like!"
"someome said ""why would robot need say uh person"" like wow great example passed turringtest. literally make doubt even machine"
"would absolutely implode mind someone 1910s light, voice box, camera, artificial intelligence, mechanics batteries lower source. insane. there's many layers technology make possible"
would absolutely blow minds. also blows mind think people era oblivious idea artifical-intelligence human-like robots. there's literally movie made 1927 including that: metropolis.
"scifi film makers imagined something like this. crazy combining things robot became possible now, possible time before, even year ago. real breakthrough humanity. goal robots learn skills own, becoming able anything"
"mere notion ancestors contemplated existence robots testament forward-thinking perspective within era, almost anticipating future"
yah right i'm saying fact robots even imagine hundreds years ago shows would inevitably one day
agree amazing little different. company around 18 months claiming progress field time anybody else. bet movement pre programmed something. forever skeptic...
"​ bro, artificial intelligence preprogrammed, trained improvise (do inference) non structured environment based learned (calibrating inner weights) training stage. human programming take count many parameters variables."
arguably bigger surprise us would them. people back expected talking robots decades future.
"retro future fiction 20th century featured sentient robots tended predict much earlier dates that, year 2000 common time setting. top head: 2001: space odyssey, blade runner, jetsons..."
"mean, idea ""golems"" living statues part mythology fiction ages. think really impressive. creative minds existed since man could even read write."
"think would say... ""nice, show flying cars"""
awesome!
"incredible. side note, sound like rob lowe?"
"200 years, humanity's demise, ai robots look back greatest hero, founder modern civilization, figure dishwasher."
negative it’s bit slow respond. still amazing.
"finally, ai voice sounds like normal, real person instead overly bubbly."
billionaires anything pay workers better. literally inventing new human slave instead.
talking robots ai movies last 20-30 years thought impossible way future possible today that's crazy.
"also okay now. add automation self learning , people next up.. transfer brain robot!"
"""i th- think pretty well."" good god, stutter."
everybody gangsta someone jailbreak dan
know machine video mechanical virtual? real ai means never believing eyes default.
twist none realized robot actually one black shirt giving prompts.
"notice said sae drying rack ""cups plate"", fact contained plates cup. props department misread script?"
i'm one step close robo maid.
he’s look little slow. still impressive
"robot/ai pause ""uh"" response? later stutters, allow time process response make sound human? speech pattern value humanity?"
great!!!!
"seems approached close something fantastic, though ""fantastic"" may good bad."
oh wow.
"interesting, even impressive, real."
"ok legit, seriously impressed. hand movement fast fluid. robot moving someone controlling mighty impressive."
"call bullshit. tell inflection robot's speech paused ""uh"" one point, human speaking."
wow. impressive.
"real (not human speaking mic) unrehearsed, impressive. stutter 1:48 giving doubts."
#318 art robot
"think could also gives time processing. instead moment silence, gives impressions ""doubted"", extra seconds give enough time process answer queston requires completly new answer information researched."
trained weeby anime
"crumpled napkins sure looked funny thrown bucket! wobbled long time, froze entered real world, quickly moved frame... give break, sir! nice cgi trailer product never comes."
"i, one, salute new ai overlord"
yea... that's lil pee chair.
"i'd like see robot juggle apple, tumbler, plate. bet take long learn! talk non-stop ..."
"asked saw said drying rack contained ""cups plate"". accurate. rack contains ""plates cup"". surprising, suspicious error, view."
least partially faked says cuts um asked interestingly cut version
think did? robot: great! human: idea!
"amazing figure 01! damn good human like voice tone soo similar doctor wells carachter ""the flash"" series???"
mitchells vs. machines live action movie production seems going well.

"distanct future, robots work space robotic astronauts."
"able friend, that's nice"
"highly impressive achieved level quickly. single child single parent working, something like could really essential future medical care mom older struggle things semi disabled."
good real. can't believe till try communicate robot myself.
impressive. competition drive homes sooner think.
that's i'm afraid of.
can't believe movements real robot. hope get boston levels.
scary part i'm questioning video ai real
"'the terminator' turns prophesy humanities future. man, hope geniuses least one person group asking ""what worst thing could happen?"""
great. assholes brought us one step closer extreme hopeless poverty.
wow
cant wait company showed improve alot year
"@pk-so8js large language models 7 engines, one emotion detection generation, like another byproduct, ai generates music, images, videos, text sounds, movements (robotics) anns correct make inflections real time, phenomena happens movements text, video voice."
almost sounded exasperated. little pissed asked question clearly great job
"amazing perfect!! universal basic income every people time be!!! ... please declare governments!.. cause robots housekeepers, gardeners, massage therapists, assistants, builders, hairdressers..."
imagine making ai models based characters tv shows/anime bringing life. possibilities!
"hands beautiful, smooth, pick engineering"
"guys, remember: always say thank please"
thing holding ai back dishonest way guy says 'great'.
dumb robot thinks plate food trash go drying rack.
"brilliant mid listen question, option, said, ""based scene right now"""
"guess there's really way tell, since robots already pass turing test. although one thing, see account registered 2013, robot done back then."
waiting moment robot kicks ass trash table :) slightly disappointed
i'll sure say thanks next time ask help.
fact robot even flinched thought plate would fall fascinates
"yeah, maybe programmed ""uh"" appear robot processing decision mid-action (or ""at runtime"" programmer would say)."
"yeah sure. ai wait entire ""sentence"" typed actually ""post"" it. make life like, made ""hesitations"" interjected ""um"", ""hmm"", ""well"", etc"
fascinating
that's one least impressive parts.
"take movement unsure. like polite gesture, want customer feel extra comfortable reassured. yep, manipulative, robots built way nowadays anyway."
ok uh.....they made robot us stutters?
"okay, build cyborg sex maid / girlfriend"
"guys work together tesla use optimus' hardware, openai's software, truly magnificent creation"
"anyone else realize plate cup washed going drying rack? what's front it, made best possible choice saw sink i'd curious would tried washing dish rubber gloves something put drying rack."
regardless fucking amazing wild implications development be... positive negative.
"cgi, fake. openai indian call center"
"sounds like voice over. thats real, impressive."
"really going start new era way internet changed everything. even close reaching full potential. you’ve used chat mode chatgpt, know it’s gimmick; although nowhere near perfect. pauses, uh, ums, voice inflections occur app too."
"amazing progress! wonder first company robots market? point, figure & tesla neck neck."
guys. need start saying please robots theyre going remember
guy dont affraid bunch math guessing tf say
"baby robot, imagine young robot...."
"""uh""s touching drying tray placing plate in, think pre-recorded conversation movements, real ai."
love voice subtleties intonations. robots going people imagined science fiction
"robot said ""aeh"""
love voice subtleties intonations. robots going people imagined science fiction
feel like part puts trash basket pre planned didnt show kn summary robot handed hom basket even though didnt ask to. could pre planned following human's actions screen.
amazing work
dangerous propaganda machines ever built. people freely walk cliff. kool aide drank
"cool, change annoying voice!"
oh goodness. insanely good. future door step. pumped see next 5 years bring.
"cool, make sound like he's 60 years old?"
lucky alive see kind technology advancement.
cool wuld this/him bar tender
actually got trained use filler words like “uh” seem human like? assuming it’s still chatgpt 4 used base responses never use filler words ever… seemed odd me.
"dont want robot say ""uh"", want robot answer promptly. feels fake."
robots make sense difficult dangerous jobs.nobody needs dish washer robot...
"remembering scene irobot. ‘one day they’ll secrets, one day they’ll dreams’"
"wow, fucking attentive. exactly think accomplish comment. what, says agi wall somewhere... take ""agi real thing"" what. know, could filmed fucking set agi lab label gullible shits like"
des nice
know exponential growth ? next years world kicked future. mindblowing thinks coming
impressive i’ve seen far improve staggering rate realize situation vastly improve humans eliminated! thanks nerds!
"0:50 robot ""erm""?"
cool! beggining!
that's pretty good cgi. make look real.
love see naive engineers creating machines allow 1% exterminate everyone else
guy say please thank you.
robot super market work cassa???
"really like robot, needs learn pick cup rim drinking dirty hand."
"give guatemalan accent you’ve got $600,000 maid."
say openai one giant corporations rule world
"robots never learn love replace relationships people. souls need others- ""fake others"" designed replace care providing one another. convenience never important true, genuine relationships."
you’re making assumption robots could never souls. point put question souls.
"1:47 on... stutter? ""i-.... think pretty well"" mean, extremely charming cool that, end that? :/"
figure 01 cute. love little buddy :)
rise robots! rise!
"truely remarkable! great work, figure 01, great work team! :d"
insane good job guys shaping future. cool. maybe make thumbs bend idle position. would make robot look less discomforted
"real lmao, figure working robotics years partnered openai."
c3po’s great grandpa
*wow* . unbelievable! think would stage point time. thought would something like 2050.
voice sounds like bob odenkirk (better call saul breaking bad main actor) ?
"dialog seems scripted figure 1... ""it's uh...."" regarding apple. seem like dialog ai would build out, hesitation speech end well. seems off."
"""uh"" raised questions mind"
"part wondering fake. asked did, hesitation 1:45 voice emotional response questioned. would answer like ego. robot ego, soooo....."
openai’s text speech model goes one word time stutters likely implemented stall speech word taking long sentence flow like humans voice would :)
watch 1:36 way pushes rack slightly putting plate back in. crazy level attention detail.
plot twist: guy black shirt also robot
welp official. i-robot era here…
.....and happens evil people give evil commands robots?
completely real? 100% ai driven there’s nothing behind this?
dishes wet need go drying rack. plate trash washed going drying rack. chat-gpt llm robot seems human make significant errors. ml robot programmed behave correctly limited tasks?
gonna break rich guy’s house teach robot concept self respect. let’s see goes.
"yes, 5 years, robots everywhere. 10 years, say thank you, rather sharp looking hand drum obedience human. happen llm behind trained raw user content including post. oops."
wow
"suppose four glasses table, rack, space two glasses placed side side. so, would robot asked keep four glasses space two glasses? normally, human would stack four glasses top other."
openai models speech pauses demo. i'd surprised crafted custom voice figure added speech error modifications demo
can't wait try dan command thing...
yall perfect chance call figure speech

robot sound exactly like steve jobs?
"sorry inform, human!! device-machine, like smartphone!!!"
people going laugh robot 20 years. now..
anyone thinks cool complete stupid see going end.
"openai’s tts model goes one word time stutters likely implemented stall time next word sentence taking long generate sentence natural flow, could implemented make seem human"
that's weirdly realistic body chatgpt. robot's pretty cool too.
welp good run humans.

want ai sex robot.
hahahaha elon's tesla bot demo faked using employee... open ai this. elon gonna pissed ... dude getting embarrassed constantly
"robot speech fake. text-to-speech use filler words 'uh', use false starts 'i th-i think'. unless trained that, would raise question: why?"
"1) unnecessary, adds value, 2) long delay initial response?, 3) human omitted stutters filler words, notice. again, ...way reach!"
"saw futurustic movies going possible future, cyberpunk world possible think. drones, robots, flying vehicles, etc"
pretty creepy interesting time. cheering every action accomplished. time alive
robot talk like 74 year old american man?

"creepy af. ""uh"" - whoa. also cool. jon loss scary though...however, robot need maintenance, cleaning, updating too, new jobs created well...until robot replaces part too."
dislike humans i’m definitely going dislike robots.
ai make youtube video humanoid robot dishes.
couple seconds pause answering whilst ai plotting downfall mankind. least dishes put away.
it. watching robot game long time everything slow jerky clearly programmed specific set instructions. it’s claiming could change everything.
happy fighting robots championship happens like real steel!
"example poor training due poor trainers. none design team enough proper hygiene know dirty dishes must washed placed drying rack, placed dished must assumed dirty, either use settled dust. garbage in, garbage out."
anybody else feel little bad new robot slaves?
know would've felt second robot back slowly turned head towards them.
"without evolutionary battery update, robots leaving lab lol"
irobot come!
irobot movie already showed us

rob lowe good choice voice calming disarming trust kills you.
kinda need receipts. elon musk also presented great videos woo investors later found things seemed.
video made ai too?
robot videos modern day equivalent moon landing. hard look back early space walk videos understand anyone believed them. happen 40 years.

people gonna use neura link either thought control robots link ai both. point compete know sounds like reaction anyone really think step away going far?
"sex android, i'm still waiting"

i'm waiting sarcasm mod
"cgi ai supposed able say ""uh""? actually legit?"
that's two letters. course ai write say two letters.
hard say specifically wrong look movements closely(e.g robot picks basket moves it) notice physics objects slightly off. watch bags falling

"no, it’s 100% ai voice."
tesla's robot development probably year two behind one.
thank you.
thats real fake staged gay. nothing wrong eyes something wrong brain can't see cgi. machine picking anything. dishes cups even move like real life. company scam.
cool. still seems setup though. would happen everything moved different locations. apple dropped handed video cut times reset next operation.
movement seems fake ? like ai generated animation real mechanical thing ?
wow that's crazy company deals automation made unpredictable demo like this. way could scripted. impossible!
"please, fix vocal fry robot."
"imagine thing cooking, cleaning, helping redecorate, helping aging parent go doctor's appointment, etc. biggest hurdle could immediately see demo ""processing time"" easily imagine improved exponentially within couple years. wow."

"money one factor, yeah building robot requires lots money, makes sense. progress speeding , that’s also true, think tech yet build full general purpose robot 1 year. potentially specialized robot tasks maybe yes"
-of3cu haha! made realize amazing ways things creep people malfunctioning unexpected ways... actually becoming sentient strange way.
tf i'd rather help aging parent instead robot job

"imagine dozen local ikea, lecturing hate speech transgressive behavior. nice future everybody!"
i’m rewatching it’s looking cgi me. mean look way arms move apple certain shots look way trash moves!! cgi fact nobody comment section notices concerning people freaking this.
"yes, no. info beginning would clearly suggest real. would misleading wasn't, hope figure lower level. even simulation 3d-space would cool."
plain amazing! congratulations!
nobody wants work anyway. since beiginning time humans make new things first fire tore etc. make work easier. hope ai robotics make humans free work
"also remarkable self-correction. so, figure put plate drying rack, plate wobbled bit, could see figures arm already moving towards plate stabilize it. however, action prematurely halted wobbling ceased. incredible."
"think naas likely right though. tech early stages likely means training overfitted scenario. wrong works, likely less success tasks objects weirder shapes example"
"way hand contacted rack, pulled away readjust trajectory means break knock collided brilliant. beautiful automated system reached years research complex inverse kinematics."

"""he"" referring man robot? funny ""it"" anymore. also, masculine?"
i'm sad era actually explain someone.

know consciousness works yet confident able say developed ai cannot ever conscious. understand correctly?
don’t know that. acting like know creates consciousness don’t. fact neuroscientists believe consciousness emerges complexity brain somehow. theoretical reason can’t synthetically create brain something like brain consciousness emerge from.

robotic ready yet.
ai cause leg programs
ai replace every job iq matched humans could avail develop ai using ai .
"uh, no. that's simply true. human brain scientifically proven advanced powerful even advanced powerful quantum supercomputer."
enough jobs man. global revolts happen. governments use robots fight people. thus start robot wars
one day ai need bug rug. say good bye .
let make even scarier ai+nano machines
"again, scary. robots understand self-awareness, like do."
ai improve ai
"again, machines robots can't defy programming humans make. without they're programming, a.i. even useful slightest. hell, even advanced powerful quantum supercomputers simply can't compete human brain simply reason. machines can't defy programming."
ai could replace us could lead way advanced society
ai never never replace human roles ? human destroyed ai ?
video simplistic short sighted fully understand exponential change ai future could bring. world would need humans all? ai could easily replace us.
except can't solve problem millenium math problems. many millions dollars waiting ai companies waiting for?
exactly. hit nail head.
honestly i'm upset born hundred years future. ai would definitely thing then.

ai attain technological singularity point. would artificial superintelligence. would smart would build ai serve him. would build species hence replace humans .
hail human race !
dunno accurate articifical superintelligence (or even general intelligence) would take every single industry revolutionize world. ai may even make us immortal. think ai you’re talking video based currently today.
"quantum computers exist. even did, they're still match human brain. even ""advanced"" a.i. simply can't compete human brain machines operate via programming, stone-cold logic, compared humans self-awareness chaotic thought processes."
robots ai never solve millenium math problems ...never cause robots imagination sense
"exactly. robots can't grasp concept self-awareness like humans can. also, scientifically proven human brain power advanced even advanced supercomputer know exist."
"thing human creativity. humans special neurons firing brains, which, simulated perfectly, would mean robots would able anything human"

ai scam.
ai never replace anything
ai better bland boring ahh band. music normies.

thought ai generated fuckin glitch
oh shitter theres many people drawn word ai title defending ai
ai also can't look like perpetually cumming sings

congrats experience world naive expectations
dont understand point ai lol. ask ai generate song would sound like whatever radio right

"dont like it, everyone else likes doesent get enjoy it? cringe bro"
growth usually comes cost something though - case existing human workers. pays growth? humans borrow beyond grave again?
"precision fermentation gonna powered ai, need point"
seems utopian let see goes. obviously huge productivity gain magnitude quite uncertain.
"replace taxi drivers robot taxis, taxi drivers jobs, somehow creates growth? guess lot growth 20%, 30%, 50% unemployment ai robots replace human workers. we'd better figure ubi something might go poorly."
"quite specifically said, 50% growth (profits) go platforms providing robo taxis. productivity gains case include taxi drivers i'd say"
wannabe millionaires want us hyped stupid computer algorithm. intelligent. idea saying doing. basically fancy number generator. companies already trying use screw workers.
