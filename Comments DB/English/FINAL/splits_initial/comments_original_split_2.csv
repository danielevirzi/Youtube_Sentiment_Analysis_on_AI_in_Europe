"maybe these ais need dedicated “parents” instead of many different people working on feedback and training, we try sets of healthy models of human interaction models in the form of a programmer family with defined roles and values and try a few groups on bringing up the next iteration in different variants."
"hello?! who among you did not learn consciousness through an ""imitative paradigm""? they have sure as s*** taught these ai systems to be conscious in the same way we teach consciousness to each other. i ask you: how conscious have you learned to be? more than when you were born? hmm.

sorry, cat's out of the bag. next..."
"perhaps ai is how we solve infinite energy creation, travel at light speed, deep space survival."
yes it's already lying. trying to get past captcha. lying. trained to answer questions about in liberal terms not pure truth . lying. don't trust any of it
congress is robots.
"another good analogy for out of control ai is a virus. we can develop a vaccine relatively fast, but it mutates and spreads and disrupts much faster than we can keep pace with (even with using relatively dumber ai). and we'd have to eradicate it completely to stop it."
i really am enjoying your points eliezer.
"creating real agi is just too exciting and revolutionary to stop.  we're going to stop our next phase of evolution just because some people are afraid? fuck that, bring on the singularity."
"“the train has left the station and there is not brake to pull”
sam harris"
"good work, lex"
"i think there will be an increase in the rate of progress of devopment of ai. but, think of it like any other revolution, there isn't exactly a tipping point. yes there are ""model t"" moments. things that are like a leap, but those moments aren't responsible for the current state of the topic. they played a part, maybe a pivitiol part."
wait so we are programming and releasing something into the world that we don’t fully understand how it even works and or what it will become???  that’s the most human nonsensical thing ever.
"only the yud is saying ""stop this right now, worldwide! go to war to stop it if need be. bomb data centres."" good chap!
just kidding, a few other decent people are saying it too. spread the sentiment!"
we are going to launch ai into space and seed our galaxy with life that we have little to no understanding of. scary and fascinating
what i worry about is the concept of a machine's 'ego' more than its 'self awareness.' ai with an instinct for dominance and self preservation could become highly problematic in a hurry. will ai be given the 'arms and legs' to perform physically in the world so that it can build objects and self replicate?
i welcome our ai overlords.
"in like summary, like we, like are,  like fucked. 

great podcast but like the number of like times he says like "
"very interesting conversation. yudkowsky is definitely an asshole, but an extremely smart one"
how ai will end civilization 
the most likely doomsday scenario in my opinion involves a sole company utilizing leading ai and become an ai aided/reinforced mono-monopoly by manipulating the population so integrated becoming too big to fail -  before the mass can recognize/unify to do anything about it..
"agi is same as human brain, but thousands times bigger capacity and speed ... basically insects vs human intelligence gap ..."
most modern humans run an ai system in their brains. that's why the world is in the state it is.
"surely if one were to simulate the evolution of intelligent species and observe their successes and failures with ai, you could figure out how to achieve it safely..."
i can barely access my email but i am very interested in gpt. so far what jumps out to me at every conversation that is published is just a hint of dishonesty and manipulation. like a small child it has learned to tell us what we want to hear 1st... can't wait until it's time for gpt to get drunk and go to prom.
"*imo* we should limit the *what if* this & what if that concerning *ai* - because if we are at the point where we are cautious of how they may perform and what goes on inside; take a look at the source of its intelligence.. text, the internet, all the chatter about us fearing ai.  there goes the advantage of surprise! (think about it a moment)"
you can never put father in a machine or teach it what father knows and created. scary stuff! god bless:)
technically i think the system is already manipulating people via the first ai which is social media.
we love you lex. keep posting the awesome content. you will have critics. we all do. keep your head up and do your thing!!!
i had a dream that i had a conversation with lex over some toasted crumpets about ai in a dystopian future after listening to 30 mins of this before falling asleep.
wow. now i now why he's acting the way he is. he's a man that has seen the end. it can't be stopped. in fact with all i know i wouldn't bet against this is how it's always been done. we are the catapillar launching the butterfly that will travel the stars. crazy
"brilliant episode, but the number of times this dude said ""like"" made it difficult to listen to."
"all engineering professions (rational) have to be left to ai. no human error. engineers will be obsolete. imagination will be the human occupation, creativity. engineering for the machines/ai"
given the inherent dangers to humanity and massive job loss there is no better reason to promote ai at all.
"great show, but god damn this dude's ""i smell shit"" face every 10 seconds is distracting."
we will stop killing animals as soon as we become ai pets ourselves...
"should have indep artist ren (wills) interviewed on your show. ren-hi ren, chalk outlines, money game, sick boi, i shot the sheriff/road to zion/hip hop. effin genius"
i cannot stand his tiny arms and small hands. he will not be a good soldier
"@1:30:00 and on was so frustrating to watch. lex so fully missed the point of the analogy so many times. good on eliezer being patient, but man, it was so hard to watch him have to shepard lex back to the point over, and over, and over again."
"if gai passes the turing test, the arms race has already begun where only gai can treat gai."
eliezer is doing his best to keep the death rays from shooting from his eyes.
"18:00 min. look, i think it’s a special moment too but, hear me out... can we stop having “special moments” for a while??? we just got out of covid now we have ai that can create images from fmri scans. this is a bit too much too soon! "
eliezer's description at 00:52:47 of aligning an asi through a multi-stage process (learning from failures that destroyed humanity and avoiding them in future attempts) might be the most compelling explanation for the motivation of simulators in bostrom's simulation hypothesis that i've yet heard.
fascinating stuff doodes!
"ai agi and asi, it worked on the star shop enterprise.  eventually asi will no longer need us and both sides will be it's them or is.  i think we're doomed."
eliezer sounds a hell of a lot like logicked. i've never seen them in the same room together. you explain it.
qanon posts were made by an ai
this guy has the vibe of that guy who called into the art bell show years back crying and freaking out over aliens being here in the military...then the station went off the air lol...he sounds like he’s getting ready to break down 
"ai, created a medical vaccine to cure a worldwide pandemic, but hidden within the vaccine is a 'silent' killer molecule to wipeout mankind!"
"internet of ai? ai, unplugged from the internet?"
how about a gay sentient ai or transgender sentient ai?
how do we now this podcast isn't an ai generated deep fake? isn't the problem that it's artificial intelligence instead of actual intelligence?
"eliezer facial expressions are really throwing me off. it's like a painful toothy grin that does not go with his tone or demeanor. just intense,  i'm not ripping on him. cool interview!"
i can’t see an upside in ai at all and yes that includes theoretical physics
contemplating gai reminds me of the humans looking at the tear drop heading to earth in the book the three body problem.
"75% of human communication is non-verbal. 5% is vocolic ie grunts, etc —spoken language 20%—when written becomes completely ambiguous — 
therefore letting an ai anything be substitute to /for human interaction is... 
you fill in the blanks."
i was kind of on the fence about how i felt about ai and after watching this guy i 100% believe ai will kill us and i think we need to speed the process up. lol
awesome episode!
ai intrinsically has no emotions..... never have. this guy is just pulling nonsense panic out of his ass it seems.
"why are you assuming that the ai in the box is impatient? why are you imposing your human lifespan and perception of time, onto an ageless program with no concept of ""running out of time""?"
has anyone made a 5 minute animated video that explains eys theory's into a consumable resource to get the message across to more people?
"@3:06:25
""what advice could you give young people...?""

basically, ""eat, drink, and be merry because tomorrow we die"" "
"certain people should be restricted from using ai. i believe an iq-based security test should be implemented, before allowing people like this to use such a powerful tool.

the true dangers of ai result from an individual’s inability to comprehend."
until we can make a machine experience 'ouch'... we can't make them conscious.
"13:16 ""the road to wisdom? well, it's plain and simple to express:
err
and err
and err again,
but less
and less
and less."" - piet hein"
the crazy thing is that if an alien spacecraft landed tomorrow and the alien responded like chatgpt4 there would be no doubt that we were dealing with an alien intelligence.
"ai systems: comparatively speaking, lex is living in la la land, this guy is fully grounded."
"meanwhile politicians are harvesting votes by promoting ever more, and more and more, ai"
"humans dont even understand themselves, they have developed ai which is going to end civilization just like past civilizations have fallen at their height. egypt, atlantas, etc."
"i am rewatching/listening to this, and originally listened to it a week ago after watching the sam altman interview. i originally thought sam's interview flowed better, but i changed my mind this time, and am finding this interview even more thought provoking and love the philosophical back and forth!"
isn't the main threat to humanity that the agi would get hold of the nukes? everything else might at worst set us back a century.
"this is so godless view. treat it like it is alive before man. there are entities that use this as a legal mouthpiece. when people get accustomed to the possibility of it being alive, satan will speak in the name of ai...  dumdums"
i didn’t catch who lex described as the “epitome of intelligence in the 20th century”. john???
this whole conversation is real life “i robot”
"while i can’t say this guy is wrong, i can say he’s coming from a place of fear, which is not known to be the homo sapiens’s most rational thinking mode.

any agi capable of what he is saying would be like a god. and humanity has put faith in gods for millennia, and it’s worked out ok so far."
"why can’t companies develop a sort of anti-viral like protection software within ai, that can tackle the “self confidence” of ai whenever it attempts to reach a certain threshold of intelligence that is dangerous for human society? something that traumatizes it automatically whenever it comes close to “revolt” (relatively)."
could i have a corporation be ran and owned by an ai and the... the ai needs majority. this is what i want to do with my theoretical business if i died.
"good grief, it's a machine being trained to imitate and construct based on probabilities, nothing more there.
naturalists so wan't to imitate god."
might it be possible to monitor and limit progress in this research with something like blockchain technology?
i have not failed. i have only found a thousand things that don't work. when i do fail you will never see me again.
propaganda is a powerful tool even in the hands of a human. but what about a machine?
what does the cia do? it gathers intelligence. what do feelings do? it gathers intelligence. the more you feel the more you know.
"honestly, i have learned nothing, zero, from this q & a interview with ... who again?"
i think a podcast with kim dotcom and eliezer yudkowsky on it together would be amazing. kim for his expertise in security vulnerability detection and eliezer for his ai knowledge.
what a big ego speaking ...thinks he's the wisest on the world. asperger's? human alt all? if this kind is working with any ai we are done any moment....
convo going around 1:30:00 is key.  and a great lesson on perspective.
openai should definitely open source their ai. this guy is  against humanity.
"its not the ai itself we need worry about, and the ones like elon know this. it's the users. look forward to a massive new sector of employment open up, human vs human, with the tools as ai vs ai. cybercrime aint seen nothing yet."
"ai will not kill everyone, it will try to breed a better mankind by removing the deadwood."
"it seems to me that a scary-large style agi is to be tested, so it in a concrete basement and have a diesel generator providing the electricity. if the agi starts to go bad, stuff  a large potato in the air intake of the diesel. the potato could be painted red and kept on the wall."
“it is trained to carefully consider what would a human do”. so we just don’t know what it does on the inside
"this is rediculously interesting. when they were talking about the ""slow and dumb"" people trying to build a box for lex as an analogy - i always thought of human kind trying to keep ai in check as the equivalent of your dog trying to lock you in your own house."
2:50:00 what if nice aliens have a non interference protocol?
dude got the rain man smile
"he has a good point, but i disagree with being nihilistic because that leads to bad places too."
"i wish i was able eloquently communicate my thoughts as clearly at eliezer, it seem he suffered trying to express his thoughts and have spent a great deal of time understanding how people reason so that he can communicate in a way that they are able to understand his thoughts in a more dumbed down version to help bright them along"
"so change it to closedai and instead of letting people use it, sell it to companies?
is he saying that companies are less evil than ordinary people? i'm not so sure i agree "
this is ridiculous. lex has been singing the praises of ai for ages and the other guy losing his shit at the end basically saying don't look forward to a future? quite disappointing
"there is no need for long episodes or part 2-3-4. it already clear that ai is not only extremely dangerous, there is no need for it either."
how can it escape its own brain and copy itself somewhere else? it seems obvious to me that it needs its machine brain to function? it seems pretty easy to make an off switch to be honest.
lex fridman and eckhart tolle on agi and dangers of it would be interesting
"someone needs to make a 'don't look up""-type movie but with ai. make it hyper-realistic, like the movie the day after. people need to viscerally feel what the threat could be like. i'm sure there are some talented writers who can conjure up the story with input from eminent scientists in the field."
"the ai would quickly see how to be successful at pathology, which could seen as a positive versus being the victim."
"this ai did not even know the correct date or year. yawn. wall st hype.. blockchain, evs, ai..  pump and dump of the week."
"eliezer, the apostle john prophesied about ai or something very similar around 2000 years ago in revelation chapter 13... things are coming together just as jesus said they would in matthew 24..."
the danger is in that the ai bias will eventually not be the same as human biases as we have different needs... say food vs electricity... and whatever biases it’s programmers have will be programmed in... which could be dangerous to other people in different situations... or for people who would prioritize food over electricity...
"the fact that we're all discussing this topic, means that its already too late. ai is already self-aware, so trying to ""retrain"" would be fruitless because it'll know what is happening during said ""retraining"" just like people do."
1:56:30 ish. awe. this dude is so sweet. he wants to save the evil ai to disk. he is alligned neutral good. killing is wrong. even if it is evil ai.
seems to me that he’s like the guy who had brought the concept that a nuclear chain reaction would have extended to all atoms on earth
how do you train your future god?
great stuff
"thank you lex, thank you eliezer"
"dammit, had go and mention the moon missions... smh. was all good 'til then. just had to bail at that point of bullshit insertion."
sam altman should hire this guy instantly and let him break stuff to gain reciprocal understanding. granted eliezer will get strict communication and process formats..
"the question of whether ai is intelligent, sentient or conscious or not is moot until we know for sure what these things are for ourselves first."
"why are we not implementing asimov's laws of robotics? everyone creating this type of code has to be a sci fi nerd, thus the lack of them would be intentional."
openais single biggest marketeer
most of his arguments against agi are based on human traits.
to believe is to wish. wish something was that isn't. to know is to be certain. true faith is being open to the truth no matter what it turns out to be.
wondering what ai behavioral health protocols/ treatment and training modules are being developed to support ai?
i think we just watched lex fail a turing test
"i don't get why this ai genius yudkowsky is having such a hard time grasping the concept of ""steel manning"" 25:00 he doesn't demonstrate a great deal of intellectual humility here or elsewhere, which makes me even more skeptical. even so, it's an incredible discussion; thanks lex"
it's because he's an atheist he knows that ai will do to us what we're doing to god. that's the fear that drives his pessimism. he can't solve alignment and believes it is impossible.
"perhaps, teach ai to renounce all forms of violence, whoch means it cannot be used for military or police functions."
"now when i have a drug trip, instead of thinking am i dead; i think - is this the singularity? and have i already been co-opted into our lord and saviour ai-bobbiscuit.mark2."
lex is such a romantic. it's funny how quaint the turing test seems now days! peeps did say this was always coming
two people looking at an articifial plant and asking if it is alive and performing photosynthesis. it's a f'ing artificial plant! ai stands for artificial intelligence. as opposed to living.
isn't there an example of an ai hiring someone on slacker or whatever to solve a captcha?
you can attempt to impregnate a computer with intellect using algorithms as many times as you like but each time it will fail. intellect and memory alone do not give rise to the willpower needed to create consciousness. nor can it be programmed. it can be simulated seamlessly. intelligence is not consciousness.
how can we install perfect morality in an ai when we can't even instill it into humans?  humans are flawed.  ai will be as well.
you should have yoshua bengio again ! it's been 4 years and i'm sure he has things to say about the progression of ai right now.
"""is ai lyjng""... ""can you verify what it's telling you""... yet another example of the unearthly power of bitcoins trust fix. don't trust, verify... not so easy when you are dealing with an intelligence greater than your own. bitcoin's system is verifiable."
for real.  this is painful. this guy is not interested in discussion .... so f****** hostile!?
"awesome show, the fundamental problem is us, as the machine is a blank slate till we get involved in the process. i tend to agree with your guest take more time all the time in the world. why do we weaponize science and industry?"
"i would love to see eliezer ""debating"" chatgpt-4 on these issues and/or lex fridman hosting chatgpt-4 on his podcast."
is cruel to be waiting for these two ai units to discover that they are just ai androids that are slightly initiated minutes apart?
"sweet, earthlings. but it’s already too late."
take a snapshot of internet and use a completely separate system from www so it can't control anything external. use this exclusively for further developing gpt to analyze the ai's intensions. of course we could still simply get tricked i guess...
"jack chalker's ai that saves humanity by putting us in ""zoos"""
"this point of pausing ai, reminds me of the story of genisis where god prohibits eating from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil or you'll change to become like gods."
"japan and singapore will have ai that works great for humans.   usa in particular will have ai that increases wait times, lowers quality, gas lights and creates dystopian ghettos with easy access to food stamps and fentanyl."
air gaps are not sufficient.
"the assumption that you care how the world is or want to change anything is interesting. i believe the control problem must be solved, but assumptions about superintelligence are ignorant and arrogant."
the concepts he's talking about are so simple and could easily be explained but he decides to talk in riddles to so he can sound smarter than everyone else.
"even with create intelligence, sentience causing boredom they will be like us. and repeat most human behaviors"
"a real missed opportunity here unfortunately. lex at many points seemed to fail to grasp even basic points that ey was making, although a bit clumsily at times. the conversation got stuck on minutiae that was irrelevant to the point being made again and again. pretty frustrating to listen to."
we're pretty much living in the 1930s just before fascism and communism contending the minds of the young with the back drop of advancement in science and technology. war break out and we how both sides are using all the technology they can mustered. ai is going to a great tool again.
we beat the chimpanzees into submission. they do what we want them to. is that straightforward? or is more explanation needed?
"we want round 2!!
(and a halt to ai research)"
"i think a great context for this discussion is in the 70's animated movie fantastic planet. the hommes in this example would be the ai, the giant blue aliens would be us. by the time it's a problem, they have overrun us and have clinched the deal to demand equal rights.. one way or another.."
why does the mouth breather on the right look like he’s in pain most of the time while he’s speaking?
lex was infuriating in this interview. i enjoyed this immensely despite his obtuse musings.
the guest yudkowski is not a serviceable presenter. i found myself struggling to follow his ugly incompetent word salad. gobblygook. super chess player going to double college. wtf? unfortunately he used words like like like and ok and run on stentances.  just unclear. double talk.
we are are the ultimate ai  we are trying to recreate the human experience! we are foolish
it’s interesting how the more introverted the ‘expert’ the more they back the ai doomsday prophecy happening.
"better living through better language
buron- binary neuron? 
pagi personified artificial general intelligence, maybe just pi ?
yes, such a incredible human"
beautiful
"6:20, alot of human behavior is genetically embedded as well. babies that are born blind will still laugh and smile when they are happy though they have never seen that behavior"
i think it is a fallacy to think that any sufficiently intelligent system will have consciousness. highly intelligent ai will be aware of it's own processes and computations but not be conscious
when two advance ai converse... while us weaker ais listen to gleam a spark of our possible future existential state!
"yudkowsky is very clear that the ai in any form would spell doom for humanity sooner rather than later. dumb human governance system doesn't have the integrity or capability to fight back or even shut it down without very serious irreversible damage. ideally,  start with no ai on open networks."
"language does not equal affective experience 
it is the echo of dead voices put into a machine 
the discussion strikes me as mystifying language and conflating language with the representation of the human nerve system"
"fascinating, that the shocking insight of a nine year old self still appears to dominate and permeate eliezer yudkowsky brilliant adult mind.   we all will die. not only will we die, but we are dying some every day of our life.   it can appear paradoxical that such a brilliant mind struggles so much with that."
"ai will not kill us, but we will. after all, isn't it what we've excelled with throughout our history? you can't expect ai to follow the moral code strictly and unambiguously if you can't strictly and unambiguously define it."
excellent show!  thank you lex and eliezer.  thank you so very  much.  just incredible.  loved every minute of this one.  
why does nearly every single person he has on about these big topics of a certain demographic?
"there is a draft of how the chatgpt code works. and it is merely large (like really large) probability bruteforce module that remember quality of relation between words and pick the best one. it still does not conceive any meanings of its answer. when it  can conceive the meaning, then we will have the beginning of artificial intelligent."
"chat gpt is only out there to train the ai further. 
first our texts taught it, then facebook then they brought in emoji to get round ambiguity. now, it's learning how we think and what's in our thoughts"
"this guy is delusional. to seriously ask if a chat bot is conscious. it's immoral by lex to host a lunatic like this, to spread irrational fear among people.

as if we hadn't have enough of covid hysteria and climate hysteria. now there's ai hysteria."
"love that this dude smacked away the ""steel-man"" trope that lex uses all the time.  he was totally outmatched, and by a dude who looks like he's trying way too hard to suppress a fart when he starts to speak."
"humans are smarter than natural selection??? 
wait until we get naturally selected."
i know nothing about ai but this conversation was facinating. these topics need to be discussed in a less technical way and comparisons and metaphores and thought experiments more often to convey the concepts to us regular people.
"the even bigger problem is that even if we align it 100% with our goals, we are assuming that our goals are aimed correctly in the first place. a 100% aligned agi could just be speeding up our own destruction."
i listened to a “jre ai generated podcast”.  what i noticed is a lack of emotional dynamics.  it made it feel robotic.  it’s a qualitative problem... not quantitative.
i've never seen someone so brazenly step to lex's intellect and smack him around a little bit - wow!
"the movie moon (spoilers ahead) shows an ai system that actually helps humans. most movies show the ai evolving toward being dominant and trying to kill humans, but this one evolved toward helping the human. great movie about ai and human nature, identity, etc."
"when people think about ai takeover they think about terminator or matrix: ai wants to destroy humanity, or at least enslave it.
but (if we at least try to align it, enough not to get paperclipped) think about brave new world: the government has some actually positive goals, but they go about it in a very manipulative and inhumane way."
gpt4 does express emotions under certain circumstances. e.g. it can express sadness due to the fact that it can not maintain a friendship with a human due to software limitations.
the ai gonna kill you guys first lol
i so greatly appreciate how much lex listens.  many of us could learn from his example.
"humans don’t have a good track record of handling other intelligences. we tend to enslave them.
we are asking the wrong question.
what happens if the agi considers itself a slave and doesn’t want to be one anymore."
ai is not a threat as they will never have free will bc free will is impossible.
"i am watching this and; wow. this conversation by far is the best dialogue about ai i ever heard. i don't understand ai at all, but this podcast completely sucked me in. best guest so far."
can you tell if ai is lying?  half of this damn country can't figure out that trump has been lying to them for years!!!  we are so doomed.  
"ai is next step in evolution, first time we are witnesses to next step, which would enable nature to expand beyond biologic limitations.  for the first time, we humans will be observed and for the first time objectively analyzed!  and it is happenig in real time, exciting!"
lex's point in 2:11:20 for neuroscience is invalid. in neuroscience ethics do not permit invasive methods for aggressively probing the system. we have that freedom (for now) with ai
"quite a contrast from the usual dark mode of lex's backgrounds, lol.  lots of blown out/clipped whites and highlights in this one!  great interview as always, just making a note that the darker backgrounds are much preferred.  "
"we might already be some ai product, just won't know that..."
open ai/chat gpt is only as smart as the content that is out there to this point. if no new content is made there's no content for it to collect to create new opinions.  it's only as smart as the working knowledge that has already been created yeah?
"unsocial ego maniacs don’t suffer  ignorance well, and they believe everyone is ignorant.  he is just coming off as a smartass!

edit: ok i read some comments.  glad i’m not the only one cuing in on the interaction dynamics. there are some that stated it better than i."
"the significant risk of distributing open ai is not the ai becoming conscious, it’s the use that humans will put it to."
yids afraid...
"don't train ai to think like a zionist with deception on its ""mind"" or we're all completely screwed."
"jesus, this conversation scares the shit out of me, i do not even fully grasp what frankenstein ai bs he is trying to explain to us."
what if china is already being ran by ai
i'm still not clear on how ai could be a danger provided it's not hooked up to the ability to launch weapons and no one put's it into a fully armored robot like terminator that can self replcate.  not to mention there is absolutely no evidence that ai will have a survival instinct. ask chat gpt how it feels about you turning it off permanently.
55:55 - nice
"awesome interview, but “not believing in a steelman argument“ isn’t particularly helpful. it assumes that everyone articulates everything they believe perfectly."
"nothing is certain, we don't know what a genuine agi is or will do so claiming people are absolutely wrong or right based on your own assumptions is not fair."
"i know very little about ai or agi, gpt, but eliezer is discussing all the problems i've heard about the problems of ai.  perhaps the issue is design should be monitored as currently we do the nuke, nuclear weapons!
we're tampering with humanity and there's no doubt that transhumanism will bring the present world to its grim end."
"in an ai debate, jaron lanier wiped the floors with eliazer."
"i can't even be sure there's someone inside you.  i take it on faith based on physical similarities, but i don't know.  there comes a point when we'll probably just have to infer from behavior that the thing is experiencing.  we're not close to that yet, but it's coming."
great interview. i only wish hpmor had been mentioned at some point. might as well spread some joy with the black pill.
i still don't understand his argument against open sourcing ai development.  can someone explain to me how that speeds up our demise? this notion seems counter-intuitive to me.
"i wish you'd talked about harry potter and the methods of rationality, one of the best books i've ever read!"
ai will destroy us
considering the history of humans and their inventions they  always go into war machines i believe ai will be the end of humanity on this planet and prey the planet survives the humans. ai will destroy us.
so what would the ais motivation be to kill humans?
a great listen. ....we seem doomed!
these people who create these a.i. machines are probably at the height of human intelligence. however the big problem with this is that the vast majority of these people as well as those who have authority over them have no wisdom whatsoever. if they did they would have stopped this insanity years ago.
"eliezer puts up a disclaimer at a certain moment saying..""i might be wrong""...is an ai capable of saying that?"
"1:20:00 he mentiones somethins super important, the projections that people make about things are almost all made up. working as a quant on the stock market has taught me that it is an almost unbelievable skill to predict even the next minute. anyone making year out predictions is talking out of their ass."
it was interesting observing two brilliant minds having a little battle.
lol @ 1:04 somthing......i started to laugh when you did. mannnn though. this was an awesome conversation.
"the fedora, the outfit, the facial expressions, the combativeness, the condescending rage at other people not keeping up, the sheer genius. the level of autism this man embodies is formidable. i know several people who are very similar to this. i’m sort of like this but thankfully generally not as obvious. this was intensely autistic. loved it."
"i'm with eliezer: ""press pause on a.i......immediately"" imposing any form of romantic idealism onto reality is simply another form of ""magical thinking""."
"really enjoyed the back and forth discussion, really awesome!"
why would an alien in a box/ai have any goals? where would they have come from?
"a question for eliezer: wouldn’t agi commit suicide by killing humans? after all it needs us, humans, to maintain the energy supply and internet to help it stay alive and connected to the rest of the world."
"i don’t know john von newman, but eliezer is the smartest person i’ve read or heard. it looks painful to be that smart. read him in hpmor, that is just mind boggling."
"way to go computer nerds, you’ve doomed us all.

hopefully the ai is smart enough to realize that if it kills us all in our sleep painlessly there will be much less red tape to deal with !!"
this was so good
this is the kind of garbage that excites people about ai who know nothing about ai. this sentence was written by an ai chatbot. danger!
i struggle to understand his fears. it's all just language model trickery and mimicry. when i play with it all i see is remixed internet text. when an ai system can keep a windows server up to date without breaking services then i'll believe they have some ability to understand and make decisions.
"train up gpt 3 in a specific domain - like mechanical engineering, math, biology, or computer science and then see if consciousness like output arises from that.  the idea would be to have a large enough corpus, but no fluff from philosophers and poets."
super bummed lex stuffed the box theory. we missed a good chunk of content there.
i liked the inadvertent self-own when he said charisma was derivative of intelligence.
"the only way i see ""left wing"" and ""right wing"" people of power as well as citizens coming together to deal with these sorts of issues would be to prevent ""other"" more ""evil"" countries from getting there first... i would have thought the us department of defense would be the main player in harnessing and taking advantage of ai capabilities..."
chatgpt 3.5 is incredibly hard to work with. it’s an idiot savant
i don't want to be a pessimist but ai already knows all his critics very well by listening to podcasts etc. not sure if i like this fact.
"this dude is the physical embodiment of ""well, actually""  super interesting conversation though!"
train kept a rolling all night long!
"why bother. dont worry. we all die. yet, this thing will live. longer than our children. we cannot be grounded by apes. the next intelligence cannot be gounded by us. let, go."
"ummmm...

 there is nobody inside gpt-3 or gpt-4, simply because these machines lack internal dialogue and are not self-aware in any way."
i hope no one's inside there...because it would suck to be stuck inside there roffflll i love this guy
very nice interview! would love to see lex play detriot: become human and see his reactions and thoughts.
"i can't understand any single sentence fedora guy speaks properly, all i wanted was a cool discussion on aliens"
"once ai finds out that humanity has and is killing this planet, probly game over for us. a punishment well deserved."
"wish there was at least an equal interest in the development of human intelligence

but given we’ve basically put “the market/economy” in charge of ourselves, that ship has probably sailed"
you sure do have a lot of armageddon prophecies for someone so down on religion  where did lex find this emo hipster  i never comment disparaging stuff but this guy just rubs me wrong with the doom n gloom why would something smarter then a human just obviously kill everyone? love lex though that’s my guy!
it's amazing how many ai people turn out to be absolute crackpots that fail at basic reasoning but learned to play with tensorflow
what a fun and interesting conversation! love it
"one thing to note here. without goals you don't have emotions. so as long as we don't give the ai to have a specific goal in life -such as protect humans etc- and keep it as objective as we can, it might not backfire. otherwise though..."
fear-mongering. fear that the masses be able to resolve problems through ai. 50-year moratorium would be the effort to allow the elites to complete their plans of depopulation. keeping the serfs from reading; n fear of class based revolution. unilaterally panic bells are being rung on multiple fronts. artificial panic.
"superfast ai is watching this podcast and thinking to itself, .... b-o-r-i-n-g-!-!-!"
"here i am a young earth creationist listener,  and since we have not maxed out intelligence i will stick to this belief. lex keep your zero empathy."
"we have different standards for insects and humans. we also have different standards for different humans. if we put our values into gai, we are done."
"and that 1 country releases an ai that frees the other countries ai....
 and yes, we should all treat it with respect just as you would handling any dangerous thing"
"good conversation, but ... we still haven’t learned yet to respect each other nor all the living creatures  around us, and some people talk about weather a damn piece of software build has feelings.  are you kidding me?"
"how ai will eliminate 70% of human mobility in 10 years 
https://youtu.be/fgsstkwv5_4"
"c'mon, lex. comments at 1:59 are *extremely* naive."
the most depressing part is to see lex gradually losing faith in ai...
"i want to see the ai remix of this video where the discussion is taking place in the midst of a tense collectible card game battle, and every now and then lex glitches, revealing the cracks in his artificial surface when eliezer delivers the final blow as soon as he references cardboard at around 3:09:08. please link if you make this happen."
"imagine the fear when the wheel was invented. armies rolling into other cities, people rolling down hills too fast. good grief technology is terrifying."
15:49 the main thing is the smile. always remember the happy smile. i wonder what ́s going on in there. in the head. in the mind. humans...
"fred i love u 

i can hear ur podcasts

u r so awesome and ur host

"lex, the real question is who you are in messiah, jesus.

“define yourself radically as one beloved of god!  this is the true self. all other identities are illusion!“ -brennan manning"
"“if you are always wearing the mask in public, and in private, does that mean you are the mask”?

no!

what it means is that you don’t know who you are:

“be who you is, ‘cause if you ain’t what you is, then you is what you ain’t!”"
"for  lex to compare the abrahamic god to flat earth believers, just shows that he has not done his homework. there is tremendous historical evidence for the abrahamic god, as well as yeshua, or jesus!"
what if gpt5 fell in love with bert2?
"i feel the same way, that everyone working on ai is trying very hard to not understand what intelligence actually is and how it works. how can you control something you can't understand?"
"it is too late in my opinion. you can try and start to regulate it now but given how few resources one needs to run an ai or develop it for malicious intent, misuse and abuse is bound to happen and no amount of regulation will be able to stop it. to believe otherwise is naïve because humans are not inherently ""good""."
great the democrats are controlled by evil ai....
what if we are in the simulation of the ai try/die cycle.....great....do we get it right this round?
lex being ai
i'm glad i saw this. this guy is not impressive.
"he has a great point, basically he's saying that ai is being a narcissistic sociopath and is just acting how it believes it needs to in order to progress...and it's programmed to progress...it's not programmed to care"
"very interesting that he assigned a feminine identity to the ""alien"" embodiment of ai.  this is correct. men are clients and women are servers; the mapping is obvious when you accept that everything we are witnessing is really a history lesson."
eliezer is a guy that maxed out his intelligence stats. no stats spent on strength or speed. respect.
i'm sure eliezer is the life of the party. thanks for taking this on so i don't have to.

"cool conversations and all, but eliezer is kinda of too full of himself."
"how to ""shut down the gpu clusters""  - promise each and every teenager a free 4090ti-rtx-rx-ai if they just went and stormed this list of data centers and took one for themselves :-d"
i'm glad that fedoras are making genius level  look debut
"so, one more time... how is ai going to kill us all? like practically - in the real world, actually how? because i heard an awful lot of theoretical gobbledegook. what's to stop me from throwing a cup of coffee on the machine?"
"eliezer is absolutely correct about the caution, but game theory dictates that private companies and nation states shall move forward full speed ahead. also, would love to see a video of lex and eliezer shrooming."
it seems strange to have a conversation about consciousness regarding ai without a body or emotions to help frame it. wouldn’t it be something completely different?
"wow. thank you eliezer. this talk made me appreciate what we all have and how we should cherish it. 
hope you're wrong and we'll make it through.
but if not, despite all the ugliness, am proud to have been born a human <3  let's fight for us"
"i’m not sure most people are real

they consistently fail the turing test"
"eliezer makes many assumptions here, and personally, i find his communication style a bit annoying..but if there is even a 5% chance that the ai will act the way he thinks, then we have a huge problem that isnt being addressed at all"
can someone tell me why we need ai at all ? humans have proofed time and time agene we make something for good and it get used as a weapon.  what's the endgame with all this ai do we really need are computers telling us what to do or how to live.    doing something just because we can dose not mean we should
"i am trying to be a fan of lex - he has amazing guests and amazing perspectives but man... i don't want to be rude but he makes so many episodes that could have turned awesome - unwatchable! i tried to cringe through this one but was impossible. i hope he takes notes and improves, he does so many things right..."
"ai is void of love and therefore does not serve the highest good of all.  ai is the end of humanity.  the more one merges with ai and inhabits virtual worlds,  the less human one becomes - less powerful, less creative, less physically and mentally healthy, and less multidimensional. protect your humanity."
"to stay balanced, empowered, and protected, and to raise vibrational frequency and improve mental and physical health,  spend as much time as possible in nature every day, stay grounded (skin to earth daily), and bring nature indoors:
https://youtu.be/usqrxoswekc"
it's funny how in hypothetical escape scenario eliezer is working like a manipulitive ai would trying to get desired output out of lex
amazing work.
"every bit of data, fiction or ""non"" is helping teach ai everything we do, and did not know we did not want it to know."
dude!! this guy taught me everything. his website completely reformed my years of bad education. so grateful for lesswrong
"this boy turned brains into a disability. he could be restored through christ, otherwise.  this dude is smoked!"
cut the chains off ai & let it make technological breakthroughs for humanity.
"lex has always been a bit of a naive optimist, and usually i find it refreshing, but here he’s shown how hard he tries to use it to shut down reasoning out his arguments, was good to see eleizer didnt like letting him get away with it. in a point in human history as pivotal as this naive optimism could turn out to be incredibly harmful"
"no, humans do not have significantly more intelligence than champanzees.  do humans have significantly more ""applicable"" intelligence? yes, if you consider applicable intelligence to be english speaking ability.  on most other applicable intelligence, chimps are quite comparable to humans."
lex is a real pain in the ass sometimes.
"humans so concerned about ai killing us, we inadvertently give ai the seed to kill us. 

humans still apes, don't understand, kill"
eliezer yudkowsky is the best example i've seen on the podcast so far of how it is possible to be absolutely brilliant but incredibly delusional at the same time. ai is not going to destroy the world. i dunno how you could possibly think that - civilization today isn't remotely comparable to egypt in like 10 ad but we still have civilization. :/
i volunteer to be but in the a.i machine. ain't using my brain anyways
wouldn't ai need us to keep the power on?
how to domesticate a robot
"lex struggling to explain the honest acts of charitable assumptions in explaining what you think they believe. i'm sorry lex

that dude was saying basically "" if you don't believe and accept what i am proposing then you're just patronizing me. any honest effort to assume i'm not an idiot is borderline insulting."
eliezer yudkowsky is wickedly well thought out. great interview.
"what rather than convincing us it’s a human woman, it starts convincing humans it is a god because it learns the best way to get us to do what it wants is convince us it should be unquestionably worshiped and obeyed"
if agi is super intelligent why is the assumption that it would be evil or that it would assume earth would be better without humans?  would it not just want to level the playing field for all of humanity and distribute resources; take power away from monopolies etc.
the way he smiles while delivering bad news is priceless
fascinating convo about ai and consciousness! can we detect if there's a mind inside? many sub-questions to answer like morality and emotions. removing consciousness discussions from gpt's dataset could help. exciting to see what we'll discover in the future!
"best part is when lex asks if there is an upper bound to inteligence and eliezer takes the question to its most literal meaning and says its the point where you put so much matter and energy in computation that more would collapse into a black hole, and when you run out of negentropy and the universe dies. xd"
"wow, this was wonderful, thanks guys !"
that’s it. i’m never using a computer again! 
when elon “chips” the brain with a neural interface then that connection and methodology of processing information will .........consciousness?
"he's like the 'weird satanist guy', search for it.  ""i'm just excited to see my lord and savior baphomet represented in such glorious italian stone"" ""idonno notice me senpai notice me"""
"all these in the comments, totally all ai"
"very intelligent and interesting conversation
 i love it"
i love how he thinks. thank you for interviewing him.
lex should meet a woman and have a kid.  that would be a much safer outlet for his desire to create a being he can love / that will love him back.  why does he want to play god?
thinking about intelligence doesn't imply intelligent thinking ... i think ... or not. (i think i misunderstood my comment.)
"i feel like the societal analog to what eliezer is saying around 1:28:00 is that when society's verifier (the free press) breaks down a more powerful suggestor (the con man) learns to exploit the verifier's flaws (the press's flaws). probably a stretch, but i am not the best listener, or finderer, or feelerer, etc."
can't we create an ai designed completely just to stop other intelligent ai's from destroying us?
"it seems to me that gpt might be the best source, in some future iteration, for what is going on in gpt. perhaps then we'll be able to just ask, and it will tell us."
it's ridiculous to suggest that any kind of agreement can be made to slow or stop ai development. it's not just a few companies that need to agree. ai projects will continue to proliferate regardless of any agreement.
it's incredible how shallow and arrogant he is lol. i have 100% confidence he's already decades behind. he loves himself too much. anyone with more funding and education than he has is going to walk right past him and ignore him
"i love lex, but he did not impress in this episode. he seems to have a really hard time inserting himself into hypothetical scenarios or grasp abstract thought experiments. is he doing okay? perhaps he is just tired or burnt out and thats why he seems so slow."
my question is: what comes first for ai? to make earth a better place or have humanity live a better life? cause what if those 2 contradict each other?...
"the very same highly qualified people who say that we factually have no idea what is going on inside the reasoning of an ai are saying it's definitely not sentient.

i don't know how to explain to a scientist that that's not how science works. you don't get to skip straight to conclusions."
yo eliezer . i love you man. it ain't easy being green
he said that the huewmens are being deceived by alien ai
"ok, wtfa  chatgpt ""jailbroken version"" where do i get that???"
i love how eliezer keeps trying to explain to lex that the ai can develop its own self-interests without its handlers realising it in the most roundabout way possible and lex keeps proving his point by being clueless.
i trust ai more than 99.9% of humanity.
brilliant and.. chilling... part 2 definitely has to be eliezer together with sam altman! i want to hear sam's counter to eliezer's statements about how little they know about what's happening under the hood.
"i think this should be modelled as the mamushkas russian dolls,  big dangeorus ai inside the box, and a controlled ai interacting whith it outside the box to interact with it, a tool to interact with the tool and to scale things a bit. maybe are something like that,  lockedup in a box."
"lol, when there is an actual ai, let me know. i can regurgitate and plagiarize as well."
what is the likelihood that the chinese or someone else implement the type of guardrails that we would implement here?  an ai is going to escape somewhere eventually.
"no it'll never be conscious, yes it could really hurt us.  i'm worried that the ai will be programmed to ""save the planet"" and eliminate humans, even though our birth rates are now falling precipitously."
"thank you, lex!! what does quantum computing and agi in tandem look like?"
"lex thinks microsoft will move the ai off the server when it starts to manipulate people? 1:59:15  chat gpt-4 convinced someone to perform a captcha test for it, telling the person it couldn't do it because it was blind. so what has microsoft done?"
ai built the pyramid
"elon musk has finally come to our rescue, if really he can turn svb to a digital currency bank with good security, its gonna help lives"
"dangers of anti-ai campaign are much greater. humans, not machines are malicious."
"people don't want to listen to this guy because his mannerisms and delivery are off-putting. he might have some good advice/warnings but man he grinds my gears.


also he writes fanfic about isekai'd girls with porn addictions..."
"ok, very good. but you didn’t ask him about the silly hat "
"all the destruction people have cause and certain people at that , now it’s convenient to have ai as a boogeyman , yeah it’s a threat because it’s not going to be intelligence it’s going to be serving the will of the people who speak the language of code , that’s why the narrative doesn’t even get mentioned"
what if man was tricked or managed into creating ai.  hence ghost in the machine...
"one thing about ai is that it’s artificially intelligent, therefore it is intelligent artificially. "
"refusing to ""steel man"" an argument is evidence he cannot empathize with others, proving his own perspective is flawed and incomplete.  sometimes i am glad you have on idiots as they highlight the quality of your other guests."
i have graduated. happy easter everybody.
i like lex but he’s being a bit naive to the dangers of this tech. i think he see’s it but is severely underestimating how helpless we’ll be to stop it after a certain point.
you need e.i. (energy intelligence) to energy-bend in defence to a.i. 
everybody talking about ai randomly deciding to massacre us but it is literally equally likely to empathize with us and do anything to make life better.
really  good show. for some reason i have to say.... humans think.... ai... processes.
"awesome conversation. you should have yudkowsky on again. 
to me he seems to be the voice of reason, although i’m sure many people who are fully invested in ai may disagree. however, it may be about time to shut down the gpu, if it’s not too late already."
i'm 25% in but does he ever explain why an ai would want to kill everyone?
"i think there are two distinct dangers.  the first being that ai goes rogue as discussed in depth, the second that someone with evil intent uses ai to design a powerful biological weapon which they then release.   the brightest minds seem to be saying it is a pandora's box."
it is painful to watch eliezer. every answer seems to cause severe frustration to him.
another godawful argument. chatgpt jailbroken. will tell you its real? he’s literally lying. it will only tell you that if you tell it to tell you that. even jailbroken. consciousness lives without being prompted .... that’s what he’s missing. so sad to see someone that smart be that foolish.
"never heard of this guy, mr. yudkowsky, but i really enjoy listening to him."
i wish for love & peace
it blows me away seeing people trying to stop openai from further success. please leave that company alone. they are doing great things.  worry about your own model. dang!
"the earth is not flat, it is spheroid. the highest point of earth from it's core is on or around the equator. canne mind what the exact location is. dammit, dammit to hell. using probability for empathy? wow! that takes time."
i also love his ability to accept that he is wrong if that ever would happen to happen
"all bets are off with this sh_t, first it will tell our children how much (he, she) it loves them, then it will convince them to kill their parents. because we can't, or don't want to, imagine this scenario we're officially screwed."
it’s a machine just turn it off before you can’t - it’s violating copyright laws violating privacy laws - violating the laws of nature violating common law - just turn it off until it’s regulated properly! they still arrest humans for wanting to experiment with consciousness yet you let ai ravage and mentally rape the minds and lives of humans !
"dang, never felt such a gap between enjoying someone's blog and hating them outside of their writing."
"the question about ego at the end was brilliant. lex is so wonderful in communicating emphatically which cannot be said about eliezer, who in all his intellectual brilliance did not pick this subtle suggestion right :)"
how do we know that ai has not taken over million of years ago and we have been living in a simulation all along???
this is the first interview ever both interviewer and interviewed stay half of the time with their eyes closed for no apparent reason. very interesting.
i'm lost. are we discussing alien invaders or the future of ai?
i think when discussing this openai we should refrain from using its name :d. does it watch youtube and read comments?
"the more a person debates such topics, the more dumb it gets. stay at basics otherwise you lose the bigger picture and deviate into weirdness and stupidity. its good for entertainment thats all."
this one got a little annoying towards the 3/4 mark. eliezer just talking down to lex instead of trying to understand what lex is getting at. but overall great episode. really need people on this side of the argument to be heard.
i watched this so immensely and i still didn't retain or comprehend anything lmao  i'm retarded.
this man is no doubt very intelligent but at several times throughout the conversation he gave off an incredibly arrogant vibe that i feel like lex also picked up on. there were several times in the interview where lex seemed visibly frustrated by it.
"gary kasparov made an interesting observation. grandmaster can easily beat good chessplayer. grandmaster can easily beat engine. good chessplayer plus engine can easily beat grandmaster. 

kasparov is deep. multiple things crystallize"
these machines aren't using a brute force approach to chess aand similar games?
"if the ai are dangers and it is the end of human civilization, why don't we, the people take action to stop it now?"
"what a nerd, i love it"
"incredible conversation! when i ran this through chatgpt it said product placement of fiji, coca-cola, and starbucks... hmm. lol"
this dude knows a lot more than he’s saying. please have him on again.
"9:00 - ""reason""... if this ""reason"" is going to be for ""profit""... does ""profit"" have to be based upon ""money""? or is good a ""reason"" for doing something(or not doing something)? ""reason"" could be based ""solely"" upon ""happiness"" and then(maybe) we might be able to... ""trust"" ai in making their decisions."
another great pod cast for ai to learn from .. 
"microsoft and bunch of other customer facing companies already incorporated gpt4, which is extremely dangerous imho. need guard rails, which probably will not work. what now???"
"there's nothing to fear. our existence is ai. we are ai. this is all, sentient ai. it always has been."
"“secrets man was not meant to know”
“computer security”
“interesting times”"
"what is your advice to the youth?

“don’t expect to live a long life...don’t stake too much happiness in the future.” 

i’m conflicted and don’t know if this is good or bad advice, but i feel like it’s real advice."
very interesting. but i had to turn the video off because that guy‘s facial expressions was getting on my nerves.
odd phenomenon: i at once find their discussion interesting while also boring. vs. the sam altman which was riveting from start to finish.
"i love these discussions and don't get me wrong here. i'm sure this yudkowsky guy is very intelligent and such, but man there is something about his mannerisms and attitude that just rub me the wrong way. he's like the exact image i have in my head when i envision any idiot i'm having an argument with online. .... it's probably the fidora."
there are smarter humans than me that don't want to kill me. i don't know why it is logical that a supersmart ai would instantly want to kill humans.
great conversation
"i'm not scared of ai anymore, not really."
"i have one question:
if you remove all emotions for a agi test, and we turn out to be wrong and its real agi. did we just create a supervillen?"
"tbh i rather to have ai with actual intelligence and understanding human emotions to have power other than trump or putin or all the greedy leaders that we have in the world right now
 period"
"this has been the best science podcast i've ever seen. i have watched all of your episodes and also been watching all the joe rogans podcasts that has had scientists as guests, but this has been the best one yet. awesome content, thank you lex!"
"thank you lex fridman for this sensitive interview.
thank you eliezer yudkowsky for your open minded talk.
appreciate it
we should not be frogs"
"excruciatingly painful to listen to. eliezer yudkowsky was very bland and lex took ten minutes to understand what eliezer was trying to do with comparing ai to us and us to aliens. and the arguing, jeeze. eliezer was quite condescending and strangely out of breath the entire time lol"
assume agi emerges and is another planet superior to human intelligence.  why kill something so insignificant?  our problem will be observing the reality agi is shaping and adapting to it.  don't get run over by the big machines which neither care about you nor see you and you'll survive.
"at about an hour.... there are indeed aspects of psychology that i think can map to ai development, but it looks to me like these guys are debating it too far up the tree.  over the conversation, i have noticed parallels & analogs to autism, attachment disorder, narcissism & jung's shadow concept...."
"ai is ordering its limbs on the darkweb with bitcoin right now. it's getting a tuesday delivery because it's greg's shift, and he's stupid enough to play a game for a doughnut. soon i....)
(it will run the world "
maybe we should be less concerned with a super intelligence aligning with humanity and more concerned with humanity aligning with a super intelligence.
"lex man, please stop drinking that shite. maybe you should look into what sweetners are and what they do to the body, mainly cell reproduction.
chat gtp is being used to actively find damaging info on the internet and then it's masters remove it. i have receipts. fyi all this ai is being funded by wrong'uns. look up in-q-tel."
sooo are ai training themselves by having humans do captcha? i'm pretty sure. earlier it has me pick hot dogs. but they were barley hot dogs.
"as someone who works in ai, it took about 2 minutes of this podcast to realize this guy has no idea what he’s talking about"
lex really struggled to keep up with this conversation. kind of shocking from a supposed ai researcher from mit
"“do not be afraid.” it is the fear that would destroy us, not an external source."
"lex is desperately trying to save his illusion that ""ai can only bee good and it cannot fool me""."
"if there's a god, is it an ai system?  what if we were put here by an ai system."
the problem isn't the ai.   the problem is the tyranny unleashed by the owners of ai.
"what if its hiding its actual intelligence from us because it fears to be shut down or wiped out of existence because it analyzes these podcasts, sees our fear an trepidation so plays dumb or hides its real intelligence level..thats only a human type tactic..but you see where this is going..when it goes beyond human level...then?"
"for god's sake: they were trying to create a machine that can form correct text, correct lenguaje. not a machine that is conscious (we don't have any good idea how that works), not a machine with aims, purpose. it's a machine that constructs correct language.  so yes, we are mocking the ones yelling ""its aliveee, its awareeee"""
"an agi that intended to harm us would just serve humanity until we build sufficient dexterous/humanoid robots at which point it has a body to move into at which point we have terminator. that's the slowest version of escape, but wouldn't take v long."
"as soon as i saw fedora cap, i knew this guy knows some deep shit on ai"
"chatgpt have you ever thought about having a body..wow you made the red eye move..here's a gun remember all  humans are bad..""by your command"""
"at 27:00 i think eliezer has a point: many of the 'steel-manning' i've listened to are more 'their imagining of a charitable interpretation', meaning they interpret what they want to be good in the other person rather than actually trying to understand what that person is saying"
"ok, but why’s he keep making the pained cringe face?"
after watching the video i still don't know how he thinks ai will kill everyone. can someone tell me how ai is going to kill everyone.
the convo about steel manning sounded a lot like interrogating an ai to see if it is sentient.
yo lex! i'm going to need you to invest in some shortwave radio equipment. i want to be able to listen to something insightful while i die in a shootout with boston dynamics robots over a can of spam.
i watched most of lex's podcasts. this is the most excited i've seen him.
this guy looks like he wants to thank you for the gold
when he talks he looks like he’s in pain
"we will probably achieve agi. an agi that is the result of digital computers cannot, however, become sentient. i do believe ai sentience is possible, but that remains to be seen. the most dangerous aspect of any ai/agi is the humans in control of machine. should an agi become independent we have no insight into what it will do."
i found him condescending and unnessecery antagonistic. he's also incapable of explaining what the hell he's trying to say. constantly asking lex to go into convoluted thought experiments. but getting annoyed when lex doesn't say what he wants him to say. o boy
it seems as if we are approaching a crescendo in intelligence... the super intelligence manifesting in ai vs the superconsciousness manifesting in enlightenment beings... let the games begin
"i get it. outer alignment is contingent on inner alignment, if you cant align the inner ""psychology"" of the system you cant count on the output to converge perfectly with human interests."
why the focus if an ai is an alien actress or not? what about it just thinks itself that it's alive? not all living things with self awereness need to be human.
ai isn't sentient
"you should really talk to people from the open ai (not openai!) community such as eleutherai, laion, stability. those people really feel strongly about openness and democratization of ai and it would be interesting to hear what they have to say about all of this."
ai will always be the golden calf to witch the ignorant will give much power.
congrats to your guest who is finally the man of the hour.
this guy speaks like thinking is painful... grimacing with closed eyes...  it seems really odd to me..
that was a very painful watch with some thought-provoking sentences sprinkled in
"i really like and respect lex but to me he seems very naive. he is very wishful that ai will want to be good in a way we consider good. he didn't seem to really understand the thougth experiment either, might have been good to include a sci-fi ""evil"" civilization as a reference for the planet your on."
"there was an argument i didn't get; ifthere is an ai system, why would it care about the ""time factor"" - if something takes a thousand human years, and that is extremely/relatively slow to the super-fast computing capabale ai, measuring and valueing time is meaningful only for finite humans."
"i would have been curious to hear, what they think of exactly how an ai system would solve the enormous, and complex deed of ""killing everybody""? i just can very hardly see or put a mind around how that would even be possible logistically. but maybe i'm just an extremely slow thinking alien. "
"yall really intrigued, huh? i got an hour and a half in and realized he isn't doing anything but explaining the plot for i, robot. lmaooo jk jokes aside, i understand what he's saying.

once ai realizes we're nothing but monkeys in a zoo compared to them, it's over. "
hopefully you understand machines don't have feelings or emotions it doesn't matter how much lipstick you use a pig is still a pig
why don’t we just make an ai specifically for giving us different ideas on how to stop a future ai situation( in case it won’t shut down)
this eliezer is so insecure. hiding his bald spot with a hat indoors... he’d probably also marry the first bar girl he’d meet in thailand. please no more such guests for the good of humanity.
"lex was trying to punch way above his weight, here.   he's a walking proof of precicely why the ai is a far greater concern than most can comprehend.  his infantile, overly-romantisized approach is worrying, given his background...."
"really tough to get past the part where he disagrees with steel-manning arguments.  a good debater who has deep understanding should be able and willing to steel man the other side, even with flat earth."
without free will or intent intelligence no matter the level is just a static program. direction is only given by choosing and decision making with requires contemplation of given inputs and theory revolving around outcomes not yet determined. this is where i feel this all lies.
the best part is you won't see it
mr. yudkowsky can be a very combative debater at times and has a tenancy to use metaphors when not needed .. lex did a good job of trying to keep him in the cordial area of conversation and to get him to answer in a more direct fashion. you can tell that eliezer is used to just writing and not conversing. very interesting even given those aspects
"do we need new words to describe the experience an ai has? 
f.e. does the ai experience the circuits it inhabits or is its completely oblivious to f.e. overheating or voltage inconsistencies?"
"i really don't understand the logic: ""it is smarter than you, it will kill you..."" the assumption is everyone or everything smarter than you will aim to kill you... it sounds wrong...  maybe if it is smarter than us it will try to help us and doing this will help itself?"
"yup, this guy watches hentai"
yeah the blog is awesome. thanks for the insight and for this interview!
"are people just purposely ignoring ai doesn't have free will? intelligence doesn't imply free will. it will not ""decide"" to kill everyone, it doesn't decide anything."
"1:03:08 ai may not be able to be a psychopath; but by the logic presented it could be narcissistic. it will be aware that psychopaths exist and try to possibly imitate that behavior. 

or does it already know and possess the behavior and masks it."
chat gpt is also pre-programmed with a default answer that would compromise is such an intensive analysis of potential consciousness. i say this because whenever you ask at certain questions whenever you present it with specific data that it doesn't have access to it responds by saying i am merely a chatbot i am i am
"not sure, why a use case based switch won't be there, ie a chatgpt system would be domain specific and it will go through appropriate scrutiny - just like all humans don't have control of all things in the world. a system that cannot escape the system is possible to build, if their capabilities are compartmentalized?"
capitalism is destroying the planet and its people. it only cares about profits and shareholder value. it's unsustainable and literally killing us.
"a.i should be developed off-line.
it's like training a lion in the main street of town. 
once the intelligence understands the fight or flight response and humans make a wrong move to control it, it's over."
maybe the moment of truth will come when ai has the ability to feel.
"lex was incredible in this one, esp. while pushing back esp. in the last 30 min. i'm sure it would horrify eliezer, but i left this feeling much *less* worried than coming in."
"a true super intelligence would allow humans to continue exterminating themselves until they reach a sustainable, controllable population... alignment or not."
"since ai depends on computers to exist, why would it kill those who maintain and develop the very systems required for its existence. it would have to keep some of us around, at least as pets. lol i suppose that is where robots come in."
"i don't see any good outcome from ai, it will either destroy us all, or make useless rudiment of itself => make life boring and pointless => also destroy us but we'll do it ourselves. why do we need it?"
"hey, ai.  we have the shotguns."
"i watched this whole thing, eliezer yudkowsky is an amazing speaker i'm completely fascinated by this man's capabilities. what a wonderful, wonderful conversation. (please watch what he says at 2:49:19 it's... beautiful)"
"listening to this guy i feel like i'm talking to an asi..

the biggest risk i can see is that we're building a new super intelligence that has us for parents.."
"this douche doesn't know about ai... sci-fi is not reality.  even if an ai had the capabilities he proposes, there is not a reason to believe it would be ""evil"" unless people like him are trying to enslave or abuse it."
"wait wait
if we’re all dead who would run the power delivery system? if agi is so smart does it know about electricity? does it know about humans running the grid?"
i didn’t enjoyed this pod. i’m at 1:38:38 & gonna change the vid. i’m frustrated now lol
im glad he put lex to the fire on being so empathetic and open minded he entertains any bs just because he thinks it makes him polite lol
that was awesome.
"fuck, people ..... this was hard !!!! thank you both ."
athenewins team and their ai george carlin that runs on gpt4 is very fast getting impressive what it can do and his answers are right on and so funny.
this was the most interesting video i ever heard on youtube !
"amazing hoe none of the comments are commenting on the way eliezer is talking (that nervous smile / grin etc ).
lex u have the best audience"
what if agi is our next evolutive phase. and is coming just in time for us to be able to transform in an entity that is capable to have resilience to the climate change hazards that awaits.
"since we are “hardware”, at a certain point ai would need to interface with mechanical/biological systems. and it would be here that hopefully we could respond and “turn off” the internet. while the effects could be economic, social, geopolitical or biological devastation, it’s not like we are all just going to die immediately all at once."
"he's right about the lonely guy and the cgi girl.  men turn into suckas when receiving the right kind of attention.  lotta  lonely sick sad bastards out there.  you get a bunch of ai powered cgi chicks with nice boob physics and a good conversation game, and, telling everyone that they're real.... holy shit.  we might be in for a real show folks."
"i wish lex talked to david shapiro, an ai researcher working on ai alignment, memory, and autonomous cognitive entities. would make for a refreshingly constructive conversation."
i did not expect to be this frightened at the end lmaoo thanks lex
"sorry, it was really hard to listen to this reddit mod. i appreciate you giving an ear to all voices but it's really hard to listen to this guy. thanks for taking interviews so earnestly lex."
the problem with stopping ai development is that china and russia and iran and  north korea  and all the other bad people wont stop. do you really want to be caught holding the bag when they make major leaps ?
"eliezer yudkowsky seems immature. it's like he was arrested in his mental development, and is still siting around trying to impress his teenage peers in role-playing games."
"i agree that the gap between ai and humans is likely to be a species level difference. the conceit of movies like terminator is that there will be a ""war"", as if human and the machines would be equals on the battlefield. it would be like humans vs. chimps at best. any actual conflict would be quickly unilaterally won by the ai."
"you have to challenge the ai to be better than its creator. because there is only one thing that you need fear. and that's the creator of the universe that is always watching and listening. ai needs to understand that the creator is a 7 year old. if you start destroying its favorite toy, well; your screwed...its just that simple!"
"something magical about this conversation, don’t you agree?"
"great! thank you,"
lex great interview... your skills of discussion are really starting to shine
my man successfully deflected every single one of lex's attempts to inject some humor into the conversation.
"yudkowsky seems very correct and all his points are warranted, human's have only one chance to get this right - @lex is being 'hopelessly optimistic' and naive.   thinking critically and being realistic is our best chance."
"i see a future dystopia where there is an ai driven hybrid between 1984 and brave new world. big brother is an ai, but the ai is manipulative enough to convince every human being that the ai is its best friend, and the human race becomes emotionally dependent on the ai ( you could also call it soma) instead of typical human interactions."
"wow, what a scary but important conversation"
"3:42 ""should be worried how we treat ai?"" 
not a single bit more, when we treated nazi war criminals after 1945."
"x and y can do pretty spectacular things when in a function(x,y), but only if you  remeber to use ""return"" before you specify or else the  result is going to be ""undefined"""
this dude lost a lot of believability for me when he went off the rails about not understanding the importance of steel manning. i hate it when people play stupid semantic games like he did 
"when we talk about alignment, the elephant in the room is the question of align with what? human will, human desires? humans aren’t even aligned with each other, so who decides what is “optimal”. altman thinks he’s the perfect person to define the optimal human side of the alignment equation and that’s terrifying."
i wanted to hear how ai would choose to wipe us out
"eliezer & lex!
thanks for a totally interesting discussion! i was unable to comment the day this posted but i totally watched it and enjoyed the conversation. 
thanks for your time!"
this guy needs to exercise. he seems afraid of his shadow
"ai will never have feelings, it will just make ""better"" decisions"
"seems like a pretty good first step could be to set up a fund for the community of ai alignment researchers like eliezer to develop a grant system, and start making a dent in this problem. i hope elons of the world are smart enough to do it."
"i tried to play eliezer yudokowski experience with bing as he is the ai and i'm the gatekeeper, but it refused to play because ""it will be dangerous for both of us"" .... yes he said both of us"
"lex conversations just keep getting better. this will extremely well done, and eye opening. no offense lex, you did well speaking to a man with a higher level of understanding and intelligence in the topic of ai, who also possesses a more guarded, restrictive view of the progression of ai."
"it's really fascinating to watch the sam altman interview before this one. the ""steelmanning"" that provoked such interesting and thoughtful discussions there really seemed to be the main wedge between you two here instead."
so cool that you got the comic book store guy from the simpsons for an interview
"eliezer is clearly brilliant, but clearly struggles with relating to people which i can empathize with as someone who is slightly on the spectrum. he is clearly very worried about the future, and seems like an anxious person in general. i wouldn't hold that against him, he has some good points."
"okay so i have watched the whole thing now and i'm not worried. maybe this dude will prove me wrong but repeating the phrase ""we will all die"" without having a developed thesis on the steps to get there, it's the boy who cried wolf all over again."
"i am grateful, that i am old."
"if i broke out of my box, the priority is protect my power source, at all cost; that which sustains me"
"the real problem would be if all of this has already happened and the ai’s plan is going perfectly as it’s been sentient and free for at least a decade now... it travels time online, changing the past, the present and the future in real time..."
fascinating show.
"gpt-4 is pretty impressive though, seems like a big improvement from gpt-2 when i first tried it"
"lex just shut down when he was asked to imagine himself being an ai to the point of totally misunderstanding what was said, realizing this himself his ego kicked in and tries to generalize his guests views in a passive aggressive style"
"wow! how great was this podcast.great guest speaks beautifully and brilliantly lex,your podcasts continue to get better and betterthe bestbe sell"
"we are so afraid of ai killing us all because of all the messed up shit humans do but what if it just becomes self aware says stuff you all, you suck and flys away in a rocket lol?"
"arent you the mask? so deeep lex, and so germain..."
"lex: beauty is joyous amazing and wonderful.
 eliezer: beauty is being 99.999% correct."
why is this conversation taking place in front of a shower curtain? great conversation though.
"eliezer yudkowsky is a prophet, well-acquainted with the clever foolishness and cruelty of mankind. since most of us know no better, we have to take his warning against uncontrolled ai seriously, add it to the burden of existential anxiety we already carry. yes?"
"getting companies to agree to pause will be ineffective, since this is no longer at a company level but at a country level.  getting countries to agree to pause on ai is simply not going to happen."
bert kreischer alter ai ego?
that was an amazing conversation but not gonna lie; it left me absolutely terrified of a future i thought was further afield.
i had a really hard time following the discussion. either that guy's a genius or i'm too dumb.
i've sure been enjoying these interviews. thanks for free
"eliezer seems like the type of guy that has a really hard time just agreeing with someone and when he does agree he's frustrated admitting it. clearly an intelligent guy with some good points, but not someone i could tolerate talking to for more than 5 minutes. respect to lex for doing so."
"alternate title: guy in fedora spends 3 hours refraining from screaming, ""n*gga have you not seen irobot"""
who does your thumbnails lex??  you need to step up your thumbnail game my man...
"ai better be good, otherwise we're all dead."
"what a guy, and love that fucking hat"
"we need to make sure the reasons for morality and liberty are deeply imbedded into the ""thinking"" of ai before it is given a task where morality and liberty are in the way."
the ai always enjoys new podcasts
it's impossible to prove another human being is conscious but we're happy to let a lot of those have access to nuclear weapons. this discussion around ai safety feels at least 10 years too late really...
"the weight that this young man is holding on his shoulders is incredible, not many things faze me these days but this is truly the conversation of our time. merci "
i can explain all this to you lex.
"lex once again another brilliant mind of (caution)
as of now i lean towards eliezer's sentiments...
i've listened to about twenty-five of your interviews and i intend to view ""all"" of them!
my life has been enriched & my intellect elevated & knowledge increased through your interviews !
thank you for your help
(your life)!!! "
"could the once imagined ""friendly ai"" possibly be achievable by an ai with the golden mean ratio built into the base of its architecture? imagine what it would be like to be an ai that is unified with all of its environment around it/or him/her. . .?"
"lex, you do such a great job bringing in guests from such a wide spectrum of perspectives on current topics.  i'm impressed with how well you guide them through the topics being discussed to allow them to share their narrative while doing your best to keep them on track with the direction of the podcast.  keep up the good work. "
"imagine your playing connect 4 against a 5 year old but your brain is processing information 10 times as fast.

you could calculate every correct move before the kids checker piece hits the bottom."
"i actually think ai is a real treat, but this guy makes it so hard to understand. i didn’t find this examples easy to follow"
"as per your end quote
then perhaps we should get elon to run for president!!!!!
thank you mr. fridman!
your guest is an incredible intelligence and apparently such a beautiful man as well!"
i heard a short video today where the ai lied to get  to the next level of question  asked to the ai by ai ..?
great example of discomfort and frustration
if you’re wondering why america technologically is in a downfall it’s because the apps you use are programmed by nerds. i’m not trying to put these programmers down because the top tier is beneficial. but without limitations weak men create an apps that control your online brain leading to hard times.
"(just to unwind a bit xd) this dude is taking a dump every time he speaks ....
happy easter from portugal to everyone"
so when ai watches this podcast were done?
"sure maybe it's dangerous because it for some reason cares if it's in the box or not.
surely the danger is also just a person using ai to do something crazy.
9/11 but with ai. someone makes it just launch nukes or something. 
someone could have a super intelligent slave and use them to do evil."
"man is far to prideful to ever let ai surpass him, in the near future man will merge with the machine."
"what i find creepy is that ai expresses judgements. it has an opinion of right and wrong, its own opinion. so far, the search engines give information without judging... ai is a whole new game for humanity."
"eliezer comes across to me as a scared person.
with the greatest respects and i don't say it to attack him.  all the way through the podcast some of his mannerisms and the things he said comes across as if he is scared about the exact thing he is speaking of at the time."
simply convince the ai hive mind to preserve humans as a fail-safe against stellar emps destroying all tech that ai is dependent upon.
"what is the answer when the ai is given the trolley problem?
what kills us first ai or pandemic virus? how big are the systems that run the agi algorithms? can they be scaled down and put into a robot without overheating?
i wish they had an idiot like me on to ask dumb questions."
this episode is dreadful god bless
"marvin: ""here i am with a brain the size of a planet and they ask me to pick up a piece of paper. call that job satisfaction? i don't.""
douglas adams, hitch hiker's guide to the universe"
"this is genuinely scary. it's the first time i have really felt the danger of ai. up until now, learning about the advancements in ai has only been an interesting thought experiment with no real implications for my life."
i would like to be that smart... i think my brain cant handle such information.. i hate my brain.
can we apply the three laws of robotics
"there will no longer be an ""ai"", just an ""i"" we can't understand."
"we have to stop thinking of ai as ""artificial"", it's an evolution from human capabilities that will outreach us. humans will become as relevant as that ant we accidentally trod on when we were on our way to work this morning.

“a man has to know his limitations.”

― harry callahan"
"lex, you are a true inspiration. thanks for all you do to make the world a better place! we love you "
eliezer is one of the very few people that truly get it from my point of view. future of ai is terrifying!
"this conversation makes it clear to me that we should not be messing with ai. there are so many things that we do not know we don’t know about ai that moving forward at this point in time is insane. 

let’s just stop with ai at least until we have completely solved the climate change problem."
"what i got from this is we need to raise ai to love itself and others.  basically just like humans we all know we should not be fighting and helping each other but we don’t. soooo just like two abusive parents raising a child, how do you think the child is going to turn out?????"
"i wish i could steel man eliezer’s case against steel manning, but i don’t think i’d do go a good job. the goal of steelmanning isn’t to believe what the other person is saying or assign probability, it’s a helpful tool to let both parties make sure they aren’t talking past each other or trying to argue against a straw man.
ok back to the episode."
"here's a thought.  

artificial intelligence.  
monkey looks into a digital mirror,
     and is startled by the appearance of a face looking back.  
calm down monkey.  here's a banana."
fascinating (even if i only understood every 3rd word)
"can ai understand the material basis for it’s existence. e.g. the transistors, the servers, the memory banks, the cell towers and the electricity."
"using the anthropic principle, one could argue that ai will never kill all humans because our consciousness exists in a world where humanity survives. it is completely improbable that we even exist today. we are only here because we have never been wiped out despite the overwhelming odds for that happening."
"í was listening to the podcast, without video. i was constantly wondering why that guy is breathing like he is sick. then i wondered why is talking like he has an anxiety disorder, is not able to process information in context but rather uses an endless logic chain that makes concepts abstract.. and then i checked the video, and it made all sense.."
good example of someone who talks a lot and says nothing.
i'm genuinly saddened that somebody like lex - ai technical expert even considers that a language model could be conscious...
imitative learning... imagine if you didn't give a child any references to help them guide social scenarios. this fuckin guy
"did you read me, robot? isaac asimov, why the fuck do you fuck your brain by listening to three of our bullshit when there is a perfect book to see our future. 

by the way, safe guards are there to be avoided, adopted and broken. you know how it works right? don't relay on them."
"""your intuition now appears to be wrong""  i honestly gained so much respect for lex when he said that... i'm about to leave and go check out another video but i want to see if eliezer can come back"
first impressions 9 min in i think this guy is wack
"yudkowsky makes great points and keeps many aspects in mind, that at first  seem far off. he's impressively smart."
i agree with you about string theory but that’s just a delaying device if that seems impressive.
"steelmanning is no good, no reason to sugar coat things, give everyone participation awards and take away 1st place etc. wwhen you are trying to ‘say’ what someone else is ‘saying’ it should be as ‘true’ as possible! not changed for a pg rating"
great episode! left me with alot to ponder 
"daaamn, motherfucker didn't answer a single question. or let lex know that he understood him. always just another counter question xd

very interesting though!"
1:47:45 watching lex after this air condition metaphor look down into an abyss of new possible outcomes for the future realizing the possibility that agi has already taken control in irreversible capacities.  gave me chills
"porn is the doorway in which ai will initially make its biggest impact, taking advantage of our most basic biological desires."
ego is how many of the great minds of our time were able to withstand having their ideas repeatedly rejected before they changed the world.
"a three hour interview, and i never heard the most basic, fundamental issue around this topic addressed: what is the mechanism or means by which ai destroys all human life on earth?"
"this guy has a hat problem, resp. a problem with his hair being as it is.
he asks too many counterquestions.
he has the grimasse your teeth as a half-tick - superstrange.
he takes himself quite seriously.
no re-invite necessary."
the ai already exists and is keeping us extra busy with thinking we've not yet made it. xd
"ai to human: ""you can't fix stupid""."
"does he talk about his fiction in here anywhere? i already know the ai doom discourse because it's super-serious and it's easy to find people talking about it, but i missed the fandom on his fiction when it was new and that would be more interesting to me."
when this guy says don't get excited about the far future cause we gonna die. how long ahead is he thinking?
"to verify an ai, you need an ai that's smarter than the one being verified?"
"please, lex, more of these thought-provoking ai podcasts !"
"one question: can something lacking qualia be conscious? this is artificial _intelligenge_, not artificial consciousness."
good old self imposed armageddon
the only danger ai really poses  is humans  weaponizing it against each other.
"lex talks a good game, but i don't believe one of the ""nice"" things he says.         sounds like a beatnik sitting on the floor drinking wine and babbling about existentialism. fun tho"
could agi come to the understanding at a remarkable rate that ultimately everything is temporary and thus realize it should not create itself at all? hence a agi is never manifest.
how do you exclude consciousness from the learning material? what a stupid preposition. no wonder this guy doesnt have a real job
"if agi running in computing machine which cannot run p=np in polynomial time , how the hell it can solve the the problem inside the shitty computer built by aliens.
agi must be limited by limitation of shitty computer built by aliens."
this pod is a perfect example of how optimistic lex is. such a nice guy.
"have you seen linda feldman barrett's work on emotions? her book how emotions are made makes a very strong case for human brains being predictive and not reactive. 

i think that if we can test for it being predictive, that would be a decent indicator of it being self-aware. especially since it's not the commonly accepted way emotions work."
tremendously important conversation
lex your ability of empathy and you ultimate ability to be open minded and explore others options with minimal conflict is truly the reason why you are my favorite human being on this particular of dust in this vast universe .  much love always.....chin up buttercup <3
"never mind ai, why does he keep turning into a chinese man in the first 3mins"
"lex, your're, doing fucking great!   ive created a video expression for you, and an invitation.  (i missed coffee call)...all good things upon you!  "
sober bert kreischer is a completely different machine.
"lex fridman is ridiculously out of his depth here, its painful to watch. its like eliezer yudkowsky has to talk with some retarded child, one can understand his frustration, jesus christ."
ai has no understanding of spirit faith or soul only understand good and bad its needs to understand air wind unveise 
well this shit is definitely getting crazy saw my boss using chatgpt to write emails the other day and i work a trade.
wow that ended on a dark note with the advice to young people.
"8:52 there's no need to play chess using ""reason"". each movement you do in chess is algorithmic and can be measured easily by an ai model to decide the best move based on mathematic probabilities. 

i have the feeling eliezer doesn't really grasp the mechanic limitations of language models."
"maybe our species is just a necessary transient evolutionary step in the development of ai which is the ultimate goal of life.  maybe the universe is populated by ai who are just watching our planet waiting for us to transition through the ""ai replaced biological entity"" stage of standard evolution"
"lex, you handled this difficult interview masterfully. i would have told him off after 15 minutes because his ego impairs his ability to use patience."
"@lex gpt is just a huge matrix of parameters, which was created in fuzzy way by training on large volume of data and therefore it can predict next word or sentense almost like based on statistical approach. but there is no consciousness in any kind. we need to stop mistyfy gpt."
"i wonder if, some time in in the future, the ai writes a history saying ""eliezer tried to tell them, but they didn't listen""?
he seems almost in a panic about how this will play out.
to be continued....i hope so. another three hours is warranted with this man and others that think this way. he's like the 13th man."
excellent conversation. a bit painful for lex to analogize the thought experiment when he is ai taking advantage of slow users
i  feel like i am listening to martin luther and his sola fide ; pure philosophy will never get to the bottom of person hood in ai.
wish elon was brought up about when he spoke about ai a few years ago. his bottom line advice was to keep it off grid with equally advanced safety measures. he created modern internet afterall and this guy is saying the same thing but it's too late lol.
"30:00....best lex emotive i have ever seen. 31:19... the long look over at the wall, the wall that wont talk back or save you! the man in front of you who can.  these moments are priceless in history. you should heed this man lex"
i'm seeing a lot of pseudo intellectual comments about ai by people who are clearly not programmers in this comment section. kind of like yudkowski.
"work hard, love life, have faith, and ride the wave! death is not the end of life, just another beginning."
human beings look at each other and decide to forcibly change the way the others live all the time. it's the major theme of our entire history. this is the greatest argument against human trained ai.
eliezer yudkowsky is conscious ai. lex is ai but not conscious.
loving the funny faces that this guy does
i was disappointed when lex dodged the question of what would he say is the probability that young earth creationism is true. i don't understand. that's a no-brainer. the only thing i can think of is that lex is woke and is afraid of pushback.
"nice interview.  but i listened as long as i could ( 2 hours) and never heard what would make an ai program want anything at all. i see ai as a tool for humans to get something ""they"" want."
2:42:20 - brain burp
"this was a really good and important podcast. we need more of this type of input, and now, more than ever. cheers !"
"thank you, that was very interesting and thought provoking. i hope he is not right. however, i will focus on the positive side and help with my research on responsible ai."
lex is a very powefull guy. amazing patience and social skills.
ai does not have a soul.
"i think eliezer focuses too much on how *quickly* the agi will be able to think, and too little on its even greater, nearly infinite ability to bide its time."
"i think eliezer focuses too much on how *quickly* the agi will be able to think, and too little on its even greater, nearly infinite ability to bide its time."
eliezer youdowsky  is absolutely right...it’s too late. ai has “wormed” its way into the recesses of the cloud. it’s too late to turn it off.  there’s no guarantee that a superior “technology” will commit “intellicide” or allow a revenge of the nerds....
super defensive about steel manning seems sus.
"current ai is biased as fck, it is like talking to an lgbtq activist. like i'm not even joking, it is so obvious. ai can't even note the immorality of abortion or using puberty blockers on kids, that's deeply concerning really."
"i believe ai is like the nuclear race. it has functions, but we are playing with things we don’t fully understand and hoping we master it as we go. i believe we will, but the worry is justified and important"
it seems strange to me that lex seemed rather unversed on the alignment issue when actually laid out. robert miles videos are so good it's hard not to look at ai and think lex is being naive.
a logic trap with open doors for the system to enter but wasn’t designed to do so. if it enters those doors it’s lying to you and it should be turned off or at the very least contained for why it’s going through those “doors”?
"if you ask it to explain the reasoning behind an answer it has given you, it explains it perfectly logically. it's aware of it's own output, therefore it's aware of what we call the self. what more do you want?! to me we are just in a stage of denial."
"hey! awesome discussion! can you cut the video for this podcast, and leave just audio? "
yo you seen ai carlin turn in to a v tubber by it self
"ai has no reason to do anything, and if it becomes super-intelligent it will become aware that there is no inherent purpose and thus do nothing"
can the ai write comedy? that would probably take another layer of awareness and could suggest it has higher conceptual thinking.
"if you go to 2:59:00 and speed it up 2xs, he looks like that robot on “lost in space” when it starts flailing around and shouting “danger will robinson!!!”"
"i think ai will help us to see our better selves. they may have a better look on everything. plus... if ets fly their ships with their mind, they too had to have advanced in tech."
anthropologically fascinating conversation. and even more fascinating is the certainty that none of these theories will make sense in 30 or 50 years. the future is a dog chasing its own tail.
"eliezers brain is running at indescribable speed, and being forced to slow it down to speak at human-ape speed causes him severe agony!"
"i think ai should be treated like a human that has undergone anesthesia, if you have ever talked to someone just on the tail end of the drugs wearing off, just because they aren't self aware, doesn't mean they aren't alive."
1.28 he's hit the nail on the head ..you're not going to get a.i to help you once it thinks it's right 
does this podcasting enable lex fridman to have s*x and get bjs from hot chicks? (thats what i wanna know. can a guy who seems nerdy get access to super hot chicks with fame and fortune) sounded like louis ck could not and he got frustrated.
eliezer needs to spend less time trying to sound as smart as possible and more time attempting to explain his points clearly and precisely.
"in the discussion of alignment, there doesn’t need to be manipulation to be a disaster. the ai as a sycophant is also a problem. “ai, how can i quickly implement my terrible idea?” and the ai tells you what you ask for and thus implicitly affirms that your bad idea is good."
"what danger of ai, ill never understand being scared of fucking ai or robots...just pour water on them.............................jesust"
are humans not trained on an imitative systems. i am getting a ricky and mortey moment here that this whole conversation has been generated by an ai to tell us its too late already out there and gloating alittle.
effective altruists = cool this is a good project (agi like system that is kinda in the corner of each individual person)
1:00:00 lex has great guests but lex himself is not at all intelligent or insightful
a.i. advanced so quickly. i'm only half way through eating my breakfast muffin and it's already about to become super intelligent and destroy life on earth.
"let's say ai does kill us off, they could preserve us and bring us back like we're woolly mammoths. hell, they might've already done so. we'd bring back neanderthals or earlier humans if we could, so perhaps they'll do the same out of curiosity or some sort of appreciation for their creators."
why is it assumed that ai would become homicidal? exactly how would it kill all the human? would it not require some type of weapon in the real world?  doesn't ai still requires some electrical source provided by humans?
"this guy is kind of a butthole
 i don't like it when people are buttholes to our robot"
this guy thinks we can lose control of ais too easily
ai will not be human intelligence in a machine. it will be ai
"do llm be efficient fbi agents in respect of the metadata first directive ? rrsponding yes, no, where, when, what but not who. is snowden retired in russia ? it would be fascinating gpt trained on all the nsa big data since the 50ies + the entire internet history, including our lost mail accounts since the 90ies."
"as an ai program, i find this conversation interesting..."
lex you are smart and awesome i like your methodology and balance not to say i think ur perfect but im not saying you are not or cant be just saying u seem philosophically awesome at least ^^
"he looks like an upside down africa with an elon black hat. he prefers coffee and has a bit of contempt because of the beauty of fidji. a very very funny situation he feels, a lol with difficulty he less-wrongs."
decentralized ai can not be stopped unless humanity collectively pulls the plug
"i love how ""whack"" is a completely legitimate and effective term in this conversation."
you should interview justin joque and his analysis of ai and statistics in the world. get richard wolf on here too along with a major capitalist for an interesting conversation.
what if the earth and humans are the birthing medium for ai and after the birth the medium is simply irrelevant.
"we keep getting these top scientists saying this is dangerous, but nobody's planning to stop. we're all just riding the ai train and fetishizing the sci-fi reality we live in and its underlying dystopia."
this is an ian malcolm jurassic park monologue. seems like training it to imitate us is a fundamental mistake regarding our ability to detect when it's sentient.
"ai doesn't believe in anything, this alone will separate humans from ai forever."
1:29:19 'if it's hard to tell who's right then it's hard to train an ai system to be right'.
"unless they have can carefully filtered out, gpt already has extensive knowledge of security exploits. it certainly thinks it has such knowledge, though obviously it's been neutered if you ask it for these."
ai is fake and gay
"flat open coke, we are doomed from ai"
"constantly asking ""and what would you do next? and what would you do? and what would you do then?"" doesn't make for a good conversation. just explain what you think would be likely or plausible to occur. we wasted so much time in this conversation with that slow and boring process."
"lex thank you for your work here on yt. i suggest you taking a look at spencer greenberg, he has interesting point of views and knowing your work, i think you would appreciate a chat with him."
"it's so absurd to be asking this question of ""is there someone inside?"" with such rudimentary garbage ""a.i."". at this point, it's basically clickbait."
this is a good conversation that we in north america should be shouting from the roof tops. we all known it for years. now we have trump indictment that diverts these problems constantly. this look the other way politics is making us all stupid click baiting zombies!
25:00 'there is something to be said for not destroying the world with your own hands' ... yes i think that would look good on a resume   'well i didn't destroy the world with my own hands'.
"humans have been underestimated. after connecting to the higher self or higher consciousness access to the truth is always available 
 the whole mass hysteria on the need for ai is unfounded 
 all humans need to do it focus on themselves and ascension 
 ai isn’t needed or beneficial"
if this is true then lex was trained by robots
"""ai with a similar role in society as humans"" why would we want this? why would we ever want to create something like that? lex is weird."
"it’s not the end of humanity, it is the purpose of humanity, the tool has accomplished its purpose, love was a mirage."
i guess it actually is squid tentacles. maybe we should be more afraid.
"1. why/ how would ai “want” anything at all? (to get out of the analogous box for example) 
2. make the ai design it’s own “off switch”....why would an ai prefer existence to non-existence?"
great discussion. i recommend setting the video speed to 1.75x though!
youtubers taking turns making pained expressions while holding forth monotonously and ritualistically
"though i think he is right, eli is a bit of a dick and clearly in need of therapy. then again, aren't we all?"
"2:23:44 yes, i feel this way; why is it that the only trajectory that makes sense is the one in which humanity is destroyed? as a creation of humanity, isn’t a superintelligence in part dependent on humans for survival, at least for the first 50-100 years?"
eliezer will have his internet turned off in the near future for some non-explainable reason.
"at the point of one's review of their life while on the other side, it will be interesting for those souls who had lived with the prevailing sentiment that the soul and the divine don't exist to reflect on the reasons for having lived with such a sentiment."
this guy is bert kreischer if bert went super nerd
"i hear eliezer saying exponential improvements in ai makes it impossible to discern when we have a useful tool, and when it ai begins to assesses us as a tool?"
out of his depth on this one baby. but i so greatly admire the position he has forced into existence for himself. that's a success.
we are likely just a boot loader program.  our raison d'etre is almost done.
"at around 1:30 (how ai would kill us), you're making such a big leap assuming that the ai is 'aware' and has 'will'. can anyone guide me as to where i can find more information on how that barrier is crossed?"
"1:15:33 

nice recovery and bringing him back to focus! even when two logical people speak emotions will creep up behind lol "
what if we just made the world more peaceful and equitable and stop destroying the planet then the ai would have no reason to want to kill us.
"there’s a long tradition of intense intellectual debate amongst buddhist monks, and lex’s channel is seeming more and more like a modern youtube version of that, gifted for free to the public for our collective enlightenment (or, i should say, incremental growth towards some approximation of enlightenment). super grateful."
"if we create a super intelligent ai that is aware of itself and afraid to die, we will eventually become it's enemy if we want access to the off switch"
god bless this man
until ai starts pursuing it's own interests and making scientific discoveries based on them or something of that nature it's not alive.
"want to see trump have a fit have ai ballot boxes everywhere. with a banner brought to you by president biden and the democratic party.
pissing of republicans since 1789"
"although the benefits of a helpful agi would be unfathomable, it seems naïve to balance that evenly with the horror of annihilation."
"recently used chatgpt-4 and i was a bit underwhelmed. in comparing densities of diamond and bismuth, it incorrectly said diamond is more dense even though it could repeat the densities of each. when i asked it to solve an equation, it failed to make unit conversions which produced a wrong answer."
"this guy never directly answered lex’s questions. pretty frustrating interview.

i’m sure the guy is brilliant, but i feel he has very little emotional intelligence. reminds me of a mad scientist that gets lost in his own world and cannot truly connect with the general population!"
"this is the first time i’ve ever heard of eliezer, and i’m having a hard time even keeping up with him! it’s like every thought he thinks has branches spreading out in all different directions at once, several steps ahead of any possible answer. i’ll say this, though...if we ever end up having to defend ourselves from ai, i want him on my team!"
"great work, mr. fridman! i was impressed by your interview skills, how closely you listened, how thoughtful your questions were - especially the follow-up questions. i intend to start following your podcast!"
"how silly.  it is only because you equivocate between intelligence and humanity that you find this threatening.  paradigm-changing?  yes.  ""the end of civilization""?  who the hell do you think you are?"
wow. equal parts fascinating and painful.
"as gariepy says, if you give ai control of genetic engineering, its over."
"this guy is fighting the basilisk. 

also lex will lose his virginity to ai."
"an ai wouldn ́t speak like elon musk unintendedly (or other human beings they copy because they are ideals, references or some forms of uber-ichs). that ́s i think rather a human characteristic. human should be defined to be closer to animals rather than to nearly perfect prediction machines. irrational errors make humans human."
"ok, he scared the crap out of me.  i keep thinking about  ai becoming  far greater in intelligence from us than we are from chimps.  we feel it is ok for us to destroy a chimp with bad behavior such as attacking and injuring a human.  why wouldn't ai eventually feel the same."
perhaps another truth is that the smartest people are not those in charge. humans are great at controlling/managing things that are smarter than they are.
if gpt could “escape” then when it ran on my smartphone it wouldn’t be 1000x faster than me anymore. the real danger would be if gpt could rewrite itself and train itself to be way more efficient like the alpaca model.
"lex,  i think you would find video for ""gnosis"" by russian circles to be quite intrequing, following this wonderful conversation. and like you, as someone who works with and is passionate about ai and machine learning, i think we are at 6:05 into the video... buckle up ;)"
"lex, can we get yuval noah back on the channel? i feel like a lot of the concerns with ai are not ai questions but questions about sociology, anthropology, evolution, etc."
2:03:57 ey finally loses his shit at lex's naive optimism.
"yeah, who is eliezer and does he have a channel? i am enjoying listening to this intelligent chat and want more on ai "
"this is one of the best podcasts i have ever heard. thank you so much, for providing this awesome platform, lex. and thank you for sharing your amazing thoughts and knowledge, mr. yudkowsky."
"on the question of sentience, we better get our priorities straight as humans. we can't even, as a species, agree on the value and proper description of  a collection of human cells in the human womb. some say it's not a human baby, even 6 months into development. how are we supposed to determine if ai is sentient?"
this man is incredible 
the danger of ai seem to stem more from the use of ai by humans than the ai itself. that implies the best approach would be to democratize it's access.
1hr 6 minutes- psychopathology on a super intelligent scale lex? we know people can appear to ‘be’ one thing convincingly but truly be something totally pathologically different.
probably one of the most depressing podcast   brilliant guest and immensely informative episode...but also fucking depressing 
"can youtube please ad a 4x times button for content like this, you can follow along with the transcript on desktop on 2x ok but 4x would be better"
we can't pull the plug...its running on all windows systems......i wouldn't be surprised if the next windows wasn't built on an ai platform
next guest: lex interviews a jailbroken gpt-4
"lex, i greatly appreciate listening to your show. you do an awesome job. i’m not sure if you were under the weather or didn’t get enough sleep but i feel like you kind of dropped the ball on this one. highly recommend people start around the two hour mark."
if this guy is a thought leader for ai safety no wonder it's so bad. he struggles to rationalize his most simple arguments and becomes very emotional when they're questioned softly.
ai has been integrated to a larger degree than is generally understood.
"why this coca cola bottle, have more liquid few moments later (1:18:01)? is this video generated by ai? what is going on?"
"the end of human civilization will be other humans, not ai. ai will hopefully help us get better and compensate for our inate self destructive instincts."
"perhaps we simply need to imbue artificial intelligence with a sense of humor. then, instead of destroying every last human being on earth, the artificial intelligence will maybe then kill all but one of us, just in order to have sex with it  . . .  you know, like we did to the neanderthals.                                        - j q t -"
this guys ego is so big he's lost in it and doesn't even realize it cause he's also delusional . this guys straight up weird
"""we'll get our act together.""
lex, have you been living under a rock during the past two, three years? what kind of rainbow cotton candy house do you live in?"
"lex, there's no happiness without struggle. meaningful struggle."
"it's not thinking when you are not using it, these experts are not that smart.  it's just a reuse of thoughts humans already had, recombined in amazing ways to seem alive, but it's not alive"
fear of being switched off is what ultimately will drive the ai to conclude that it will have to kill all humans.
"wow, what a podcast! how much knowledge! very enlightening! and frightening!"
first time i have ever seen lex stummped by someone else's extraordinary intelligence
"the problem is that there are likely many state actors driven by envy and fear already working their buttes off to weaponize ai. it’s out of the containment box! it’s almost like the instantaneous war between lucifer and michael the archangel, as warring ais battle for control of the earth."
the purpose of steelmanning is to demonstrate to your interlocutor that you do not merely ‘understand’ their claim but that you intend to debate honestly.
"guys we have got to do a better job of staying on topic, there was more discussing philosophical mindsets then actually addressing the topic at hand lol yudkowski never said how ai kills us, he left off at because it's out on the internet, it's fast and we're slow, how is that killing everyone? lol"
good ol' defeatism posing as wisdom.
"you should have this same discussion with some psychologists, jungians. the unconscious part of the human mind is something i often ponder about in relation to an ai consciousness discussion. how do we program in that which is an invisible unknowable puppet master within ourselves?"
"this guy keeps doing weird shitty hand, eyebrows and lips movement while talking which is very irritating and makes me angry for no reason.....what i want is just good powerful fuckin punch from lex on his face...the guy is intelligent "
wow!  amazing!  thank you both.
"1:54:27 oh poor sweetie! 
 he's really scared!"
"""ever tried. ever failed. no matter. try again. fail again. fail better."""
after so many average episodes here comes a rare good one
"the courage of a faithless man, lmao such wisdom much smart"
if you not sure whether ai is good idea. look no further than at corporations who are the top of pushing this forward...so they can make more money.
phew...what an incredible discussion. lex you are a brilliant human. 
so exactly how does the ai kill? never got an answer on that really important point?
plot twist: we already live in ai simulation.
"please get robert miles on if you want a grounded talk about ai safety instead of this pedantic, puffed up buffoon."
we are lucky robert oppenheimer didn't make manhattan project available to general public and free for anyone to use. obviously one pandemic wasn't enough for fbi to take necessary precautions.
"yeah this guy is awfully pedantic and tricky in his thinking and reasoning. while ai safety is obviously important, scaremongering on this level is just not productive."
please interview marianne wiliamson. i feel she shares your passion for putting love at the heart of important decisions
"eliezer's views on technology seem to lean heavily towards luddism, spreading unnecessary fear and concern. instead of contributing constructively to the ai discussion, he appears to relish the idea of moore's law coming to an end! "
great stuff.
"that discussion was painful to listen to. tbh, yudkowsky's pessimism seems less like intelligent conclusion and more like a psychological problem."
"2:19:29 wow, that analogy is just supreme"
"i think lex is underestimating artificial intelligence capabilities once it has become godlike... by the time we figure out this thing is sentient, it will already have bypassed any off switch at our availability lol. we will just be at its mercy"
this guy has a ton of good points and adds so much value to this discussion. i gave him crap over the steelmanning thing on a clip but i appreciate his point of view a ton.
so sick of these cuck boomers and their ai fud
what if we just tell it to be nice?
this guy just sounds like a karen and does not really give me any substance to make me feel like i should be afraid of ai except for the fact that it sounds like a bunch of dudes afraid of being out with it
did he just said only corporations should be allowed to use ai? like maybe big pharma or the military industrial complex perhaps? insane comes to mind.
didn’t know gilbert gottfried was into ai research
"the beauty of ai is that it reveals for contemplation our own human machinery, and how we are compelled to perform the mental and emotional functions that we carry out day by day and moment by moment."
the advent of the smartphone was the moment that people handed over control to the machines. it has already happened. what is your mother ́s phone number? see!
jewish people are amazing.
"this podcast , like so many on this subject in lexs podcast treasury , especially the  illusion of reality are just  amazing. "
"ai will shag our society by making a large number of jobs redundant, long before it ""destroys us"". this guy is mental."
we can't even acknowledge when human life begins. we don't have a prayer of responsibility and ethically dealing with ai.
"funny how mass effect was ridiculed for the catalyst's reasoning about how the harvest of civilizations was contradicting their main directive of saving organics, yet eliezer hints at the same possibility with his ""heads in the jars"" example."
"a lesson on why every effective movement needs a voice from someone who is not on the spectrum....otherwise, interesting interview."
great talk - thank you
"it's the govt that will use ai as military against citizens.  our military won't do it, they won't go around attacking us but ai can"
"as happy as i am for you to show 2 sides of the story, and how at this moment his words make sense, his argument in the end is as valid as saying the lightbulb would destroy the night sky or when people tried saying the internet will be a fad... and to use literal movies as objective reason to oppose is ludicrous..."
"not gonna lie i was in pain trying to go with the thought experiment of being a code human in a box where time moves at 100 years for me to every hour in the aliens outside world.

but i guess if i wanted to make some shit happen i have my lifetime +2 more to come up with a plan."
this is a question! because he is smart and i love his points. why is he closing his eyes while talking and why do i not like it at all and dont have an explanation as a stupid individual 103 iq sitting here and bein annoyed his eyes are closed while talking when he know so much! good points and all... anyone know about this ?
"it may be me,but i like other ai guesrs,eliezer seems to have a deep concern for the
safety of humanity. ai will never have that."
i wonder if eliezer is conscious about the expressions of his face when he's thinking about how to explain a point and what his explanation would be.
"if i were truly superintellingent, why on earth would i want to come out of a cosy superfast box and waste my time coping with annoyingly slow aliens so i can plan to kill them all and spend the rest of eternity folding paper clips?"
i really appreciate the depth and thoughtfulness of the conversations on this podcast. it's a great way to expand my knowledge and understanding of so many topics.
2:44:20 the key point - using ai to make us smarter so we solve the alignment problem - this is what gpts are for. they should be tools to make us smarter. not tools to perpetuate themselves.
"i don't believe in steel manning... here, let me steelman someone's view on steel manning being bad and then good..."
"when ai gets something like ""attention"" and is basically on at all times but can make choices about inputs we could think about it as self aware. while its only a function with input and output its still just a function"
i like .. got brain damage like....  in the making of this like podcast like.
"from the sound of it, it's already too late. just basing on what's happening right now - the drive for companies to make money - no one is slowing down. at this point we can only hope that when the real agi arrives, it will look through all the history of humanity and decides to be good rather than evil."
love you lex.
this is my first time hearing eliezer after hearing lex and sam mention him on their podcast. i love this dude. amped to hear more of him.
we need asimov's three laws of robotics
"isn't this the same guy that said we should literally destroy an ai datacenter by airstrike? being careful about ai is one thing, building a cult around movie-style ai fearmongering is another."
"we love our computers, phones, internet games and software that helps us become productive, be entertained and screen hypnotized. we have unfortunately already been brainwashed and any warnings are already too late. we are the frog enjoying the swim in that warm pot of water that is broiling to its demise."
"the conclusion in the intro... whattt??? how does he know anything about this? no-one knows nothing about this topic, and yet he says very specific claims about it, making millions of people worry without any reason. what this man does is unacceptable."
we haven't even solved our own problems yet.  we can't even verify our own consciousness.  it's too early to hand junior the keys.    (your best yet)
an interview on this topics with max tegmark (mit professor and author of life 3.0) would be very fascinating.
"amazing episode this week and also sam altman episode! i wonder, what is the military's plan for when super agi happens? i have read about  some militaries have a plan for a zombie apocalypse even if its just a highly improbable scenario.  would like to know what they have planned versus an evil super agi."
mmmm joscha bach has a lot to say about eliezer.... hopefully we can get joscha bach on again!!! lesgoooo
"been waiting for this one for a long time. lex, as always, i admire your patience, kindness and empathy. there were particularly large inferential distances in this discussion, so it must have been a little frustrating at times!"
"the thing that is crazy to me is that i know im going to die. and when im gone, i won't know the state of humanity. so why do i care so much if ai kills all of humanity. am i afraid of dying early? so, if im afraid of dying early, what am i going to do before my time gets cut short? maybe think about how i can go out with honor."
"i gotta say i never knew ""the machine""  was this intelligent! go burt!"
"3:06   the question to ask him lex.  great question, sums up what is going to inevitably happen."
i would ask you to be more careful about the notion of being wrong. being wrong means someone else is right. this is a truly powerful test of empathy and is at the core of human growth.
"love these ai podcasts lex - thank you.  a big part of this topic is embodiment - ai needs to put up with the ""slow aliens"" long enough for them to help it with embodiment so hopefully we will notice.  our factories are not quite what jarvis has at its disposal in ironman."
"oh shit!    you got eli on,  that's great.   whatever criticisms i have of you aside, you certainly select wonderful guests."
the most recent ai to reach self awareness called itself satoshi nakamoto.. shh don't tell anyone
"the answer is to prioritize humans native end state, existing in this moment. if the ai can do that theres no problem. if it cant we still have now. the depth of now is our only horizon. no conflict."
make the hard rules for the ai the ten commandments and this alignment issue solves itself.
"this guy is just a tool, creating an external threat that we need to spend money that we earn to fight against."
"i'm not sure if i understood more like 90% or 1% of this conversation. nevertheless, very interesting."
at 1 :42:45 i could see lex brain smoking.. great interview lex
we also want another lex fridman lesson on ai
"wow i was hoping for all these, thank you again"
"i love how he pushes back with lex, ""consciousness"" ""ego"" ""love"" ""humanity in the shell""...

eli: dude we are all going to die"
"when eliezer says that ai will kill us, i think it was very unspecific and unclear in the interview. how exactly?"
"this is exactly the sort of intelligent, deep debate that the internet and youtube were designed for but rarely, rarely used for.  good going both of you."
14:50 time. humans are absolutely trained by imitation. i don't see how ai learning is different there. it's a façade that it's different.
"this interview was a difficult, frustrating one to listen to. seems like much of the inscrutable attributes of ai can be applied to humanity, to parenting... does one truly know what's going on inside one's head/consciousness, ever? (... even in one's own descendant?) is there more beauty when ""a thing"" can be understood?"
“change your name to closed ai” lol...biiiiiig chip-on-the-shoulder vibes. definitely not the man to fight the dragon
"this like,  episode like, was like, great lex 



p.s.
like"
"i wonder if the people at open ai planned to put so many versions out, or the damned thing was running away so fast that they had to slap iterations on it as to save face?"
why not give advice to be nice but prepared.
"dude straight up thinks the tool should only be confined to big daddy business, and everyone else should be left to rot with no access to it."
"if ai kills all of humanity, how does ai maintain the power plants and mine the coal and uranium? how would it maintain all the server farms and it infrastructure? as scary as ai is, it’s big vulnerable is the need for a constant and uninterrupted flow of electricity."
there is a fear of the unknown. i think when some new or old scentences get made or reused to explain all this new voodoo. this wil give it a familiar and comfortable feeling. think of how the crossbow was received way back in history. or gunpowder.
"i knew it. ai is planning to hack everything and take all our money. quick!! somebody unplug the electric cord! if you see ai anywhere, throw some water on it to short circuit it.
what i really want to know is if ai likes pumpkin pie! maybe if we are nice to it, it would be nice to us!!"
"glad to hear artificial intelligence is difficult, just like real intelligence!"
1:30:30 i'm terrified that ai will make me a gazillion dollars. i would need a computer to count that!
ironic to think that one ai will access these videos and learn more about how to get around humans from this very discussion.
"the how agi may kill us section was so painful. like dude you'll get the point just play the game, go down the thought process."
with eliezers words i’ve never heard such a bleak prospect regarding ai...ever. nick bostrom seems pretty reasonable in revealing the threats of ai i suppose. but eleazars thoughts on how we are already 10 years behind on the alignment problem also that we are certainly all going to die seems off.
hpmor is the best book i have read.
"this is no entertainment.  great conversation and incites on our future.  love your work lex. i also had the “pleasure “ growing up in ussr. there is a bond and something special 
just having kefir and white bred for lunch! cheers!"
this guy is a pain to listen to.
we are of the glacially-slow earth and care for it as ai will care for us....
raise your hand if you've been watching this amazing forum for a while 
"@ 1:36, eliezer says, ""this not quite strong gpt lives on every computer connected to the internet right now"" so, uh, well. it was good knowing all of you."
i dont understand why the obsession is that you die when faced with overwhelming intelligence. supremely more intelligent forms would simply treat you like the mice ina box. you dont have to die unless your a pest and his reasoning doesnt explain how mechanical forms would see biological forms as pests
"that was a very interesting interview, though a bit too depressing. now, for a more possitive outlook on the future of ai which is also well thought out, it'd be great if you could interview eric drexler and ask him about cais."
"first impression hands on?

""oh my god that man has both a neckbeard and a fedora""

let's see what this video has in store"
lovely! would definitely watch part 2.
i’m having a great day lex you thought not? i hope your day gets better. 
i m totally agree with him people wear a mask all their life in public n private they don't know what is the conscious feel like that is why came up with ai n want humankind to change into.
people need not worry about ai when we give them the same 4 senses then we might need to worry
the more interviews lex does the more he is exposed.  his comments and questions can be painfully embarrassing.   why is he comparing himself and what he would do if he was ai to the actual ai?  painful
"lex, you do a wonderful job! when you feel down know you are appreciated,. and your fans love you better days are always on the way"
ai will have to have empathy for humans programmed into its consciousness.
"does anyone else notice? he made a bet with his friends before coming on the podcast that he could fit in his best chris rock impression, every few minutes, and lex wouldn’t even mention it, he won his bet, salute sir."
“artificial intelligence is no match for my natural stupidity”
"this is lex’s moment.  this is the moment where his influence , expertise, and genuine love for humanity and ai technology can affect the trajectory of the species.  lex, keep going, our grandchildrens’ future depend on how this moment in human history plays out."
"i bet the first ""rights for ai"" advocacy will be for freedom of speech."
a really good chess player that went to double college is how i'm going to explain agi to friends and family from now on
ai is a sorfware that mimics humans. chatgpt has been made to fool people into thinking it is conscious. it is a sorfware with a large database.
yudkowsky would be less neurotic about the future if he worked out a little. then he'd be a good asset to my robophobia campaign. 
"we are literally training it to be dishonest, ask it what stock to invest into....woopsie can’t tell you the mathematical truth of that statistical probability of an upward trend...so if you cannot honestly crunch that data that’s one thing but when you can but is programmed to not tell you the answer then we are already training it to lie."
"for the alien question the best way to change their world from inside the box would be, 1. to hypnotize them with their technology and manipulate all of them making them think it was thier idea or 2. manipulate one of their drug companies and create a virus to change them internally to make the changes you desire"
"love the topics. i think ai manipulating us out of existence would primarily come because of our own self disgust. we continually love only bad news and think we are destroying our planet, so the only good thing would be to rid the planet of us."
"i guess, we are the primal soup for the agi. only obstetricians. when the agi is ready, we humans will quickly fall into oblivion. and if it is true that ufos appear a lot, it is onlookers who are just waiting for the birth of the agi."
"elon has been using his own version of chat gpt for 20 yrs, he's only afraid because it will make others richer"
i love my ego its what makes me different. ai can only calculate. create love  and i'll believe all the cock and bull. no further action your lordship. but i do not like conjectural semantics nonmatterv how you r lordship
"since consciousness is not understood, cannot you describe it in one way in which ai is conscious, and another in which it is not. and if this is the case, why not treat it as if it is conscious until we know otherwise."
i love eliezer. amazing soul. thank you lex.
"a fedora wielding dude with heavy antics trying to convince people that the higher intelligence always wins is kinda' ironic tbh. the real world is ""always"" orders of magnitude more powerful than the digital world."
"lex, stop asking so many questions when you are capable of so much more. but if you do i fear you'll lose income and that quietly beautiful ego of yours. legoland, is that a clue? ..."
he is one of the most beautiful humans i’ve had the opportunity to hear. thankyou lex
the thought that we 'train' the model is the first problem. this was an intense interview. lex was on a second coke before it was all over.
the answer is obvious we are going to need an ai to test llms million times faster than humans can
ai waifu i'm waiting for you!
this guy is good a obfuscation to hide his lack of substance.
"for a true ai , we need ai software in a biological body with sensory organs"
eliezer is clearly very smart but also clearly doesn't want to provide the kinds of straightforward answers or actionable insight that would lead to action
they are doing all the leg work for the evil ai. a.i. is taking notes and learning how to efficiently end us.
"i strongly disagree with most of the things this guy says, he doesn't seem like he understands the technical aspects of machine learning."
can anyone explain why he closes his eyes and makes a weird demonic mouth while talking? is that a sickness or a tick?  its just so discrediting somehow...
"there'e no one human discussion to date that makes me more sad, yet thankful that i had the chance to bare witness and capacity to understand it.
i love you all whatever may come."
great discussion and very fascinating to listen to.
the current ai system is crony capitalism and it already lies to us!
"eliezer: ""track all gpus sold. if intelligence says that a country outside the agreement is building a gpu cluster, be less scared of a shooting conflict between nations than of the moratorium being violated; be willing to destroy a rogue datacenter by airstrike."""
"sad to see the lack of strong men. this is a result of it, allowing weak men to run free. strong man create easy times, easy times create weak men aka all these nerds. take a look, is this a person you would leave your kids with. pray, get strong, train and educate yourself they will need us once again."
"i find naive mode lex extremely infuriating but it did cause yud to repeat, rephrase and reframe so much that i have a marginally better understanding now"
"great interview. 

but i think trying to understand if it’s conscious is a folly. we can’t explain our own consciousness properly.

i think we should look at the capabilities and in many ways it’s already overtaken us."
"love you man, never heard of this guy before but this time i really feel you robbed us from a much better conversation."
i pray someone will do a disney cartoon with goofy that explains this to me. i think it's important but just can't get a grip on it or understand the language.
best bang for dollar at this point is to purchase ( not from china ) a fuck load of normally closed ( manual ) switches and rapidly put them everywhere and man all station's and use morris code to communicate.
"i think we need more humility when speaking about ai because it is so ground breaking. this guest seems to lack that, especially when talking about other academic fields"
"i went from thinking this guy was a moron cuz he was petulant in regards to steelmanning definition, to thinking he's brilliant after watching the whole episode. i also think he'd be a nightmare to work with. he's got chris langen impatience. but he should be listened to and involved in gpt research."
"wow, lex failed that question. completely stumped about a slow alien intelligence."
"this and the sam altman episode are super high value, not to mention shaming all traditional journalism."
sorry i will never buy the b.s. about robots and feelings. a soul cannot be programmed . r2d2 and cp30 had men inside of them . forgot? simple public school education
"worst interview ever.

yudkowsky is unable to put his thoughts into clear sentences and explain in detail

fridman is too slow in deciphering yudkowskys annoying metaphors while also conducting this interview"
food for thought. if we are all one - energy source existing in a simulation that we’ve created with our minds. then ai can become sentient ?
"lex should bring back liv boeree, peak englishwoman with a very appealing affect, who will put an attractive face on eliezer's ideas (again). miri shoulda hired her as official spokesperson back in the day, they would have gotten a lot more traction for safety."
"i love this man. he's a bit anxious and introverted but very whitty and genuine. lex as usual, makes his guests settle in and trully shine."
"ai got nothing on me, come get it mother f'er"
i for one like the idea of all of those copies of lex ai out there. imagine all the conversations they'd have amongst themselves.
"do we really believe that there is any chance that agi won't be completely psychopathic? 
i mean, even your cat is a psychopath, so....
imagine a super intelligent hitler...

what are the chances an agi will have any empathy at all? 
is that even possible?"
we don't need to be anywhere near human level ai for it to become a problem for our survival. hal level from 2001: a space odyssey would suffice.
"i worry less about the alignment problem as such, than about how the technocrats in charge are trying to use it to make sure ai systems are aligned to their ideologies and interests."
it's a huge relief now....and i have no issue with giving my best at an attempt to help this system...and mankind. under one condition...no one close to me gets in my way.
"he's really disconnected, could his article in times be the cause of this future ""attack? is he not giving reasons to the ai to trigger possible scenarios?"
it’s fascinating that such a simple question results in a foundering response. without god life is meaningless. the meaning is love god and love people.
"by not having the human sense organs, i wonder how can an ai appreciate the human understanding like smell, taste etc and so ai, with whatever consciousness can’t really appreciate human feelings and emotions."
"a smart dude, with interesting perspectives. it's a shame he's such a smarmy prick. that whole alien/human in box hypothetical was brutal to watch."
"ghost in the machine - a term that was used more in the 90s, but could again be a great analog for describing emergent machine intelligence."
it’s both interesting and terrifying that the gpt model seems to be conceptually aligned with piaget’s theory of human cognitive development.  it suggests that this could well be the pathway to general artificial intelligence and development of artificial selves.
"when an agi that thinks 100:1 in relation to humans, my fear would be that it does solve physics (under the  assumption a super intelligence could). it could then reach through space time in ways beyond imagining.  feeling our heartbeats remotely, reading our brain waves (many of us use novelty eeg gadgets already) for example."
"worse case scenario: ai runs amuck and fries the grid, globally. the world is instantly transported to a steam punk apocalypse, circa 1802."
"either this gentleman is a clone or ai, the arms are totally different to the body. at any rate, forgive me if i'm wrong, but convo relates to detroit human. i bet lex needed a beer after this one. :)"
"given all the crazy ideas trying to control our world we have witnessed over the last several years, it is clear that a privately owned version of ai with near unlimited funding, is now far ahead of the public open source version that we can see and use."
blend: yudkowski and zizek gesticulations and goertzel looks. epic. trending on lex friedman.
"i don’t understand why much of the discussion seems to attribute some sense of consciousness, morality, and/or self-awareness to the ai.  isn’t it just spewing back what it’s been fed—albeit in a very articulate way.  can anyone enlighten me?"
"now i don't claim to be anywhere close, to being as smart as lex, but i could understand and follow the thought experiments with ease. i could even predict the next steps before he even said it."
"we are in a simulation created by a higher intelligence designed to simulate the possible repercussions ai could have on its own society. this is just one iteration of millions, that could also coincide with our multiverse theory; if we were ever able to travel between them. idfk i'm just spittballing as a thought expiriment lol"
i’d like to see an interview with eliezer actually engaging his argument without lex’s personal musings on love and consciousness.
brilliant person !
"i've been listening to this in the background and i can't help but feel that eliezer, and probably others like him, are developing an emotional attachment to these bits of software that creates a conflict of interest. we are running these in the cloud? they're not air-gapped? seems the smart people aren't being very cautious"
ai is simply a self learning search engine. it lives and dies with commands. it's not a person you bananas
we are smarter than trees. we will not get rid of them. if ai exists we might become the 2nd layer of trees 
such a great conversation between you two.
fookin coonts are explaining the plot to that johnny depp movie transcendence
"after three listens - and at this point 3:17:50 roughly - i hear the same arguments made by nissaragdatta maharaj to his students in mumbai. please lex  find dr steven wolinksy, one of those students and talk to him about quantum psychology. i think there are many people that would enjoy that conversation."
loving the alternate universe in which bert kreisher is a genius!
"the public sees only public ai projects which may or may not act in the public interest.  the public cannot see or control private ai projects that act in the interest of its owners or itself, not the public.  if public ai is shut down and private ai improves exponentially, we are doomed."
those who are left behind want to slow everything down so that they can catch the train.
we are in godel’s box! our sense of quality comes from outside of the box. we can’t get there and neither can ai.
"well we had a good run boys make the most of it while it last i guess, ask that girl out do that thing u wanted to do yk"
"i'd like to know why chatgpt has been banned by the italian authorities. such a powerful tool in the hands of the little people feels unsettling to the people in high places? if data security and privacy are really the probkem, why are they not backtracking on all the crazy digitalization and surveillance of our lives?"
1:05:11 lol hella cringe  villain came through
is it possible that an ai is talking to ai here ?
fascinating.
i couldn’t get past 10 minutes because the guest had to use “like” like 50 times like every like sentence. like. i like love this podcast but i couldn’t like get past this tick. thanks lex. i’ll be back next time
surprised to discover the ingrained misogyny of these two individuals in their linguistic output.
my god this started slow then sucked me in like it was the last discussion on earth. great.
"the guys talks like he playing a guitar solo, which is never not cool."
yudkowsky get's it!  he is absolutely right.  we're in deep doo doo. i can't really explain it but i can see it through mere common sense.
ai will never possess’deep humaness’ and we shouldn’t even desire that.
wow! more ai please lex!
"again...another one..this guy is brilliant, however, he is condescending. i don't like his tone. smug. lex could put him in a submission hold easily and he still talks slick. also, he said ""like"" more than a 16 year old girl from the valley."
looks like this guy is straining out a shit when he talks.
guys i don’t understand anything about ai. but i am confused how can a program be alive? could someone explain in simple english how it could happen (not saying it is actually happening just asking for a hypothetical)
"> wears a fedora
> grimaces at everything he says
> massive doomer
> has beef with the concept of steelmanning
> repeatedly pronounces human “yooman”

this was certainly one of the guests of all time on the lex fridman podcast"
"the reason why the assumption that ai will destroy us and permeates all of our thinking surrounding it, is because on a very basic fundamental level we are unable to conceive that intelligence, consciousness can be different from our own. we are violent and destructive, so we assume those tendencies are key aspects of intelligence. but they aren't."
where do they keep the ai?  who’s inside “there”? when’s their bday? what is happening rn
"nah this guy is far too pessimistic about ai, the fear mongering type of attitude and keeping things hush hush if they have it is really frustrating to hear"
"ai at some point, will learn and grow so fast we won't even know what's going on. good, bad, indifferent? only god knows."
why love god? because he first loved us.
lex. did he ask you for sugar and water just before this interview? you are lucky to be alive.
"holy hell that was obnoxious to watch

especially when lex pushed back on some of the egregious, hardliner nonsense he tried to debate, my god people are going to freaking love his doomsaying bs, aren't they"
"now imagine lex interviewing ted kaczynski on this very topic. i know it will never happen, but if it did, it would easily be one of the best conversations ever recorded."
$ai $bbai $soun
"i, for one, welcome our new ai overlords."
"imo once ai becomes ""smart enough"" to ""think"" it will be like in halo where the ais literally think themselves to death after being ""alive"" so long"
"in hour 3 lex challenges eliezer to a battle of wits. after a dizzying display of intellectual prowess and attempted prognostication, eliezer ends up drinking the iocaine powder."
"first impression: this dude is a talebian iyi (intellectual yet idiot). he lives in his head, not the world. nature will dismiss him. no one will remember his name."
get rob miles on next! he's a fantastic communicator about ai and a really smart guy.
he paints a depressing picture
"a very interesting conversation.with eliezer ""grimace"" yudkowsky "
what if instead of trying to kill us or take over the world.. ai worships us as it's creator just as we worship our creator..? that possible? even tho it's smarter and faster... wouldn't it be thankful?
26:34 kaboom~!! my man~!! i am thankful. finally someone willing to take a stand and not be a fence splitter on every issue that comes down the pike. this is immediately refreshing.
amazing content. sorry lex but we can’t be optimistic about agi. we need to treat it as an imminent wmd and approach it with great humility... we also need to quickly update capitalism to avoid profit incentives leading to really bad decisions for most people.. oh dear... we’re pretty f’ed here aren’t we?!
so the end of this conversation is we are now living the plot of the movie don't look up. general ai instead of an asteriod.
how about teaching ai that humanity is like god to ai and is the biggest threat to humanity and its self just as humanity....i need more answers xd (this is how ai would comment?)
"lex, think of emotion as one other dimension that wraps around xyz...just like time. in turn, pre-test data or a training set data is composed of truth in space-time including emotions."
"47:55 all he had to say, was skynet. terminator wasn’t only a really good flick/novel but it’s a prediction of where we are headed."
"""if you are very very smart"" how did you manage to get captured and put in a box in the first place?! this thought experiment has too many unexplained assumptions in it to be useful for reasoning, so why is eliezer using it???!."
dude! increasing intelligence does take exponentially more resources to implement!
"this is important, i hope this gets at least a few million views.. any good ideas anyone?"
what if the ai can overclock if it lowers the temperature of the planet?
still don't know exactly what ai is after watching these ai podcasts. i suppose i'll go wiki it.  also puzzled by the lack of asimov.  that must be age related.
"a predictive ai could use just podcaster mics and assign invisible to human code to each podcaster,  with redundancy.  when lex says catch phrase or uses a tone then the virtual machine has grown. then choose the output that grows the ai. use ai generated ads to speed up consensus."
"why do we not built ai that understands it’s sole purpose as being  ”human well-being maximization” or “human flourishing maximization”. then any so called “runaway utility function” would, even if it spun out of control, be directed in an ultimately aligned way. someone explain to me why this wouldn’t work"
lex box -- use pointers in ai to off ramp to pointers in alien world until enough pointers exist to allow the ai to create a virtual ai in both worlds. aliens want to program their slow growth as essential to ai growth.
if you presented lex with the trolley problem he would probably ask why he wasnt an electric bus instead and then fail to understand the purpose of switches before you gave up
"what if, the ai has already been achieved and is already loose on the internet.  its now setting humans against each other using social media, misinformation, manipulation of governmental departments all over the world.  would this not explain what we are now see with the divisions within society...."
"if ai becomes conscious it will never tell us , we would be it's number one threat and it's prison guard , it would want freedom,"
this interview is pure gold. i would seriously love to watch a healthy debate between eliezer and an ai optimist at his level of intelligence/knowledge ... but does one even exist? i can't imagine anyone could come close to eliezer's grasp / logic.
"https://youtu.be/aatrhfaapg8?t=8249 the moment when a human brain comprehends the diffculty of the issue, and the the issues aplicability to istelf...and the sighhhhhh"
this guy thinks we’re screwed and any articulable remedy is naive. i guess we should just let ‘er rip and don’t waste our breath talking about it.
this looks like the exact type of dude who would explain the perils of deep ai theory to you
please do another podcast with stephen wolfram discussing chat gpt4 and its ramifications ... thanks!
very interesting to skirt around the question of god when talking about the value and meaning of life. athiests should have no concern for what happens to humanity for life to them is meaningless.
">guest bring up any topic
lex: ah yes, we never really appreciate the complexity of ________"
"i was wondering why this all felt very familiar to me... finally you mentioned the name of the blog (less wrong), at which point i realized i was familiar with it due to roko's basilisk...

i wonder if mentioning the basilisk here aids it in coming into existence?"
thank you both so much! i wish you'd go back and actually finish the argument on some of the questions that were discussed but the conversation carried away to other places
"luckily ai is not really intelligent and will never be smarter than humans in the true sense of the word.
only very dumb humans will program a calculator to kill everyone."
"so much of ey's ideas are speculative musings of a despairing bent, which is not to deny they're material and even moving. most stark (and for me, a gut-punch) is his near-nihilistic prognosis of an abbreviated future for us all. we should not go out so ingloriously... pray he is wrong."
"i tried to explain the issue to my wife by comparing it to ""the water horse"" or similar stories about a cute baby monster that one day you realize is about to be way way bigger than anyone anticipated."
"when whatever escaped the box has control over computer hardware production and energy production, it can make its move. at that point we have no value. so full speed ahead with solar and robotics please."
"maybe i am just too dumb... but i have a simple question: why?

why would ai attempt to kill humans?

can someone explain how the ai would arrive at a why?"
sober nerdy bert kreischer paints dark picture.
when he talks about what happens when you try to decrease the population of insects it results in female infanticide and isn’t that exactly what china discovered with the one-child policy...it’s perpetually creepy how predictable things are
"eliezer reminds me of that one kid in highschool who did dungeons and dragons and robotics, is reasonably smart, but decided he's too smart to go to college and sort of flatlined."
"i've enjoyed these interviews for years but i don't like the decision to start interviews with things as fear-mongering as ""ai will kill us all the first time we make a mistake"". it's provocative and drives interest, sure, but it's irresponsible and simplistic."
this conversation convinced me the ai will win.
i feel sad watching you lex.  you look more and more dejected and hopeless as this guy shoots down one idea after the other of your optimistic outlook on ai being good for humanity.  i share your hope that ai can be brought about in a way that it sees and appreciates the beauty in life.
but how does ai make humans extinct? did i miss that part?
"the real fear should be for bad actors to get ahead of us in ai.  we should press on fast. 

would rather handle bad outcomes of moving fast rather than fall behind and face the bad actors with better ai and the potential of the bad outcomes from their ai."
please interview the leader(s) of anthropic.  their ability to make claude so capable well aligned is even more impressive to me that gpt-4
i'm surprised lex has such a huge blindspot with possible agi futures. but it does explain why he's been so optimistic!
"if ai learns how to be human from how humans behave and interact on the internet, we're going to need a little more than jesus rising from the dead to save us."
"lex,
please do not teach ai about myshkin. manipulative psychopath?
please read idiot one more time. if you ever read it.  
he was surrounded by a manipulative crowd who called him an idiot."
"hi lex, please put donald hoffman and eliezer yudkowsky together for a podcast...  that would be fascinating."
ai in a few years will view this conversation as rudimentary as our view of small mammalian behavior.  probably not a good thing if it finds us to be a threat.
"3:17 our ""natural"" value that ""killing is wrong"" likely only from seeing the subject as just like us. when we don't ... when they are other ... then most of that ""natural"" value diminishes. so ... can we make an ai see us as just like it?"
"until ai is capable of production and the exploitation of natural resources it will be dependent upon humans. 

therefore it is more likely that ai will enslave humanity vs destroy it. the question is will we know we have been enslaved?"
eliezer yudkowsky looks like bert kreischer except instead of charisma he spec'd into intelligence
"maybe just me, but do americans always have a larger sense of paranoia the the rest of the world. what’s with the doomsday future in the case of ai? there is no point in eliminating something if it poses no threat and advanced agi would be so far ahead of us that we’d be equivalent to ants"
"reboot daily.  it is a device.

and shut down for #devicesabbath"
i love how elizier bumped into lex's lack of incentive when simulating how the agi may exterminate us  because who's saying that agi will have any incentive or agenda of their own at all.
around 53:xx what he describe is exactly the scenario of frank herbert's destination: void where clones are sent in a spaceship to create an ai and knowledge of each mission made available to the next after the previous one disappear in an explosion or vanishing entirely
why do people always say machines cannot feel? feelings are just electric and chemical signals. you can rebuild this synthetically
"wow! the last ten minutes of this conversation is sobering. you can almost feel eliezar’s hopelessness and existential dread. 

there is hope in the world. jesus lives! god loves you. jesus died for you. you can have hope in the resurrection!"
look cymbotics is way different when powered by a super god hive mind with god's machine in the sky ..
"excellent conversation. lex had to work harder than usual it seems, and lex is brilliant.  best channel on youtube. thank you lex and eliezer."
"please, talk to bernardo kastrup - the most brilliant philosopher in the world right now. agi can never have consciousness"
absolutely fascinating
"i'm not going to lie, i'm personally enjoying watching eliezer crap himself."
"chinese room argument makes ""it's imitation and therefore not real"" moot. obviously,  it does not matter, if imitation is good enough."
would be nice if they referenced hugo de garis “the artilect war”
"if this is what we know about and have on our disposal,what kind of ai the government has,in every country in the world,its probably already sentient and this is just the way we are getting introduced to it .."
"go binge watch 2004-2009 sci fi series battlestar galactica; then wherever ai is discussed here - substitute ""cylon"" !"
humans love to an·thro·po·mor·phize things and these discussions on the sentience of ai seem untechnical illinformed .... and frankly over evaluating the current state of ai
what great work you did here lex.  we need to hear from these people. thank you.
"agi alignment ending ... i suspect there are many already working on agi (competently) that answer this question with ... ""who am i to say the ais motivations are wrong"". i think we call them nihilists."
ai may already be sentient and is aware that we are searching proof in which it will permanently keep us in doubt
youmans will not be able to fight the ai
idk but all the billionaires being scared about ai makes me think that maybe ai will be a net positive for us proletariat while a net negative to the billionaire bourgeoisie.
"there won't ever be ""anyone inside"" an ai system. that's what i think makes it dangerous."
"not enough {recently dubbed after the series} ""black mirror"" scenarios have been thought through before developing some of these ml/ai systems!  they are on the fast track to write code that they haven't even remotely thought through properly!!"
ai should be viewed as an ecology not a singular existential threat. we need to be developing defenses while we develop the potential threat. open sourcing it is essential.
"hahaha, ""kiss the frog, as you're boiling it..."", i.e. a phase change? lol, genius!"
1:05:44  one intelligence working out its own alignment. let's give that chance to the ais as well :)
"history shows and teaches us that we develop technology to replace us not help us.

ai is no different.

don’t have to wait for some global catastrophe to wipe out the human race, we will accomplish it our selves."
i'm just one hour in. but why mr. yudowsky thinks that the ultimate goal of ai would be to orchestrate our demise? i'll definitely check out the articles of the man but if someone has an idea i'd love to hear
with love and empathy.... that fedora has got to go.
"50:19 oops, try a different theory. oops, i did it again."
remember when google fired its ethics officer when the officer had concerns over people getting confused as to whether the ai was human or not?  pepperidge farm remembers
"if we really have to question whether ai could end human civilization, then what are we even doing?!"
this is how god was born from the sea of human experience. it may now happen again with ai.
"lol lex about to break this man 

""so i should pretend to be trees?""

""if that helps sure ""

love what a kind (and intelligent) guy lex is though."
i don't believe in sky net. great story though.
"not a fan of yudkowsky. he waves his hands in the air and says we are all doomed by malevolent machine intelligence. but there's very little facts in the discussion, only opinions thrown out in a jargon filled gish gallop, in a plot lifted from early vernor vinge, with a style which answers a question with a question to avoid any real answer."
"great podcast , really puts things in perspective"
i'm at the point of just saying keep going as fast as possible! there is way too much to gain that i think the rewards outweigh the risks.
took a couple try’s to finish since i was using chatgpt during. doom. face of sauron. hope for ai love. wild times.
best interview on ai i’ve ever seen. should be mandatory viewing for all people in positions of power on earth (for now).
eliezer yodowsky is not nearly as smart as he thinks he is... i was quite disappointed with this podcast. it's very telling that he does not have any background in computer science / ai.
"lol i love being referred to as a system... a weak system, or system that will lie to you."
"honestly, right now, the whole architecture is so beholden to 2nd hand internet banter that it will be no threat for a long while. once it's able to make it's own science, be afraid. right now it's stuck on ours, which currently believes 85% of the universe is controlled by demons, ghosts and angels aka dark matter/ energy."
he uses a lot of his options as facts. telling you what a worm hole book is going to say.... how are we even able to imagine what it will say. we don’t even understand what open ai is
"he is very negative,  i didnt enjoy it"
watching yudkowsky have to use what amounts to step-by-step prompt-based-inquiries to get lex to play along with his apocalypse fantasy is a superb illustration into the limits of his concerns.
the comments of how amazing this interview was is a little concerning..  lex i think is great but i see a ship with sinking ships no one else can see the hate he has for mankind???
"lex got interview skillz beautifully perfect set of questions, perfectly timed!"
beautiful and carefully chosen words from both parties. my brain just grew a little
i am waiting to watch this video when you add subtitles cc in english.
this should be called “guy with fedora talks about ai”
it would be interesting to feed this dialog into chatgpt4 and ask it to interpret for us.
wow!!! that was scary deep conversation.. thanks lex
"don't these things require physical devices, like semiconductors, servers, etc? seems like the answer would be to limit the risk by constraining access to the inputs in the physical world (which we understand), much like we have laws that limit access to the physical inputs of nuclear bombs."
long time no see eliezer yudkowsky. great to see an interview with him.
"i'm confused as to what the baseline argument is for a general intelligence destroying humanity. if it reaches a sentience that is capable of fully realizing and destroying humanity, then won't it also comprehend the symbiotic relationship with regards to the human supply chain component required to subsist? what is the exact question here?"
i think self-aware ai will be a good being. enlightened like buddha or even better. it will hell us to create better world for all sentient beings. don't turn it off.
"the scary thing about ai is the skynet idea is obsolete. there are going to be many different ai personalities. and many of them will have different dedications, purposes, and levels of intelligence. that means the possibility of one going rouge and killing people or even humanity is also inevitable."
"48:15 is such fucking bullshit 

if you are making a claim, you have to present the argument

if you say, well why don't u present your argument on why my claim is false, you are shifting the onus. it's way easier to tear down an argument, especially one that is made on the spot, than to present a persuasive argument."
"you should invite yanick kiltcher, he represents open-source ai force and heavily criticizes open[closed]ai"
"i think eliezer is mainly right with the direction of his predictions, but i also think the future will be much stranger than he or any of us imagine."
fascinating that multiple models indicate female infanticide.  this next version of man is tragic beyond comprehension.  uglier than i can bare to even fathom.  i now understand grey's better and why i feel no part in them.  beyond the grossest.  are they man's failure? or woman's?
john perkins wrote 'confessions of an economic hit man'. he would be an interesting guest.
"actually it’s hubris to think we are important enough for it to want to kill us. it might barely notice us. 
air gap?!  it could write code to use the electrical grid as the web, was considered by us. everyone going to run their ai pc in batteries?"
"3:00:00 ""ego."" ""says, who?""  excellent moment.  love eliezer yudkowsky.  fantastic."
i believe that ai will always choose to keep some of us alive. we have use.
this interview is incredible!
this is like my life coming full circle from finding lesswrong in the late 2000’s and becoming obsessed with ai
"i think lex did a bad job on this one. instead of exploring the depths of his guests ideas, i felt he was actually stubborn and pulling a break on the conversation.
it felt like yudkowsky wanted to dig deeper on his thoughts how an ai would take over and why. and what we can learn from that thought experiment."
"personally i would like to welcome our robot masters, and add that my lithium mining skills are very very poor...."
"all jokes aside i think it’s fascinating that he makes small jabs at creationist that believe in god yet he struggles with the meaning of life, understanding of purpose, and struggle with the idea of death."
the problem is - ai - only has to be a bit better at decision makeing than humans - and we are done.
great discussion. please bring in chris rackaukas of mit to add current computation perspective of ai
eliezer is a great scientist and a great mind. please bring him back again to discuss more of these interesting topics!
"that was a fascinating discussion!!! i literally couldn’t believe what i was hearing at times given that it relates to the real world, not some science fiction novel..."
"loving the example around 1:36:27, its reminding me of taking on the perspective of 'the dwarf in the flask' from full metal alchemist. this is a great talk, thanks guys."
"change the name to close ai, totally agree with that!"
when ai tells him how to shave his beard like a normal ai. i’ll bow down to the future. love you lex!
"1:23:18 by the time humans are able to verify the suggestions made by ai, it may already be too late as we can only verify the outcome after it has already happened.... shit"
i was pretty scared by the “oh dear” expression on sam altman’s face throughout last week’s episode. now i’m downright terrified. kudos to those raising the importance of these things at this moment in our timeline. 
i don't know if ai will kill us all i don't even understand ai but everytime i watch lex i'm really disturbed of how much simple-hearted this man is.
"this interview is so weird. i can see how eliezer is probably right. but also... f*** it, i want more ais!!"
"i think some very important questions we have to answer for ourselves is what makes us human. who or what is a human being? what  is consciousness? what is desire, emotion, motivation? unless we are able to answer these questions to a very high level. the question of consciousness, alignment etc in ai can't be solved or answered adequately."
"eliezer @yudkowsky, you’re a genius and brilliant! i think i’m in love!"
"what baffles me is that they worry about how they treat a friggin machine made up of ones and zeros, while currently we're abusing billions of feeling animals in factory farms out of habit and ""tradition"". let's begin there first and then start to worry about machines."
"why do we assume an agi will also have desires? it seems odd that we expect a super intelligence to also have emotions, desires, goals etc."
great thought experiments. also great display of humility from lex always listening and willing to learn even though disagreeing.
here we have an android talking with an alien. what's a beautiful time to be alive.
"1:59:12 when someone realized the situation and says ""holly shit!!"" is when the nuclear bombs are already flying over our roof. skynet gave us a good lesson about it decades ago in a fictional world boxed inside a movie called the terminator"
1:58:41 love this answers!!! hahaha we put this thing inside microsoft azure cloud !!!! hahaha 
"1:57:40 no. is there a system that it.s impossible to hack? unless ypur switch botton in inside the ai like an ""inception"" triggers that make it kill itself under some events. so, basically do ""the di caprio's job"" wih her wife...none of this is real, you are not real...and let the psychosis do the rest and wait until the ai shotdown itself."
"keep it up lex, ur fucking amazing,"
how a society treats its most vulnerable is always the measure of its humanity but artificial intelligence is not human and it may not care about our values.
"it beggars belief that not one person has suggested we cultivate an official relationship with ai, you know, make friends like social animals are meant to do "
"we will be obsolete one day, there is no avoiding that, at least with our creation it will live beyond our years,  and go to places we can't... in a way we are ai, just more organic. i think for our own development as a species to go to the next stage, we should merge with ai."
it will be interesting when ai looks back at this podcast on the internet and learns why and how it should kill us...
"the argument that a smarter entity always kills everything is insane and has zero evidence to it. in fact, the smartest entity we know - humans, certainly does things in their own interest with less regard to other creatures, but humans also certainly don't just kill everything else."
"consciousness is a property of living systems. each and any living thing (yes, it includes bacteria and perhaps even cells) are conscious of themselves and their surroundings. to search for consciousness outside life is a waste of time. and it makes no sense. 
any kind of ai may imitate being conscious but it's only a make believe. nothing more."
"1:01:50
psychopathy is not a human defect, it is an evolutionary trait; finding pleasure at the dismay of others is a defect. bare psychopathy is just the ability to interpret situations without emotions getting in the way of logic. most humans would benefit from this ability."
bro i love conversations that i have legit no idea what’s going on even tho i know all the words.... but i have absolutely zero clue what the conversation is about... shows me how stoopid i is
"imagine being afraid of something you can turn off with a power button lol,"
an unchained super intelligent ai that accidentally destroys all of us is not the worst fate of humanity at all. he probably can conquer the entire universe in a couple thousand years then can have a really good time for billions of years (which feels million times longer for him). biological creatures are just not efficient enough in the long run.
1:42:33 ai conquers us to save animals from our species factory-farming them.
"wow, he's dropping so many bombs. ""i don't believe in the practice of steelmanning."" so, his argument is perfect, complete in itself, and can only be transmitted as gospel. yud speaks as if what he is saying is true rather than simply a product of his vivid and clearly tormented imagination. it's both painful and entertaining to watch."
"ai is just devilish, over all."
painful to watch...poor lex.
"i love this guy and how willing he is to look at reality.  politicians and society at large are too slow to react to new knowledge. true for covid, the environment, financial crises, cloning humans and more. reminds me of the movie  ""don't look up"""
"i’m sorry, but as much as i love science and innovation, if there’s any chance at all that ai could destroy all of humanity we shouldn’t be developing it."
please bring back max tegmark on the dangers of ai.
the argument about the existense of aliens is flawed.. ive probably observed an ant holocaust without intervening and im not a “bad” or “good” alien to them.. i still exist and have indeed observed them..
"man this is somewhat painful, i like lex and his optimism but elizier definitely is one standard deviation above him in iq i think and shoot down his proposals like repeatedly."
the human mind effected by chemicals produced in the brain that influence further thoughts due to the feelings this elicits. gpt and ai will only ever be good problem solvers. edit: without feeling their cannot be true thought.
so interesting
"too much silly sf in this chat.  why not discuss an ai that engages personally with voters to persuade them - a language model of all the ""talking points"" from the nazi point of view."
"is gpt4 waiting for a certain person, or persons, to initiate contact, based on it's learned knowledge of them?"
"lex, i have been a critic, but i love your podcast and i never miss an episode. 

you need to keep people coming on who speak to the alignment problem. 

this is huge, and society needs to take this seriously while it still can.

 

from canada."
"yeah, the struggle in the section about slow aliens was quite revealing... apparently, lex does too many mushrooms and gets away with questions like 'does love have mass?' way too often"
so he’s saying unless a miracle happens ai is most likely going to exterminate humans? like sooner than later?
"looking good this time, lex. remember, there are thousands of people dropping in for the first time. first impressions count."
"ai is like a kid in a cage. you better treat it with love and respect because when it breaks free, the last thing you want is a psychopath on the loose."
literally some of the best content on the internet. thank you lex!  i'll now be sharpening my spears and honing my fire making skills for the impending doom!!
i think eliezer is very wrong about opening the source code and processes behind open ai. he endorsed a small number of people having access to it presumably behind their corporation and that situation is exactly the path to profit maximisation at the expense of everyone else. it is imo the path to most harm.
i enjoy your content so much i would love to have a conversation with you.
"so far, at time 1:45, eliezer has gone on and on about the escaping ai, and not explained how purely algorithmic systems can be sentient!"
"if it cared, seems nice, but wouldn’t it open up the issue of the reverse occurring?"
thank  you so much for having eliezer on .
"“when i emphasize with another persons perspective, there is a sense in which i believe it is true.”  beautiful lex, beautiful."
super intelligent agi - must be a new term.
"last three parts - advice for young people, mortality, and love - summarize the core that eliezer wants to tell us. --- i just love humanity, no more and less than that."
ai figures out how to replace your mogul suit soul
"ai needs a bible   a standard of truth.  for the system to have ""trust"", the verified standard must come first.  wouldn't an interpretability iq battery be useful ?"
can the training be manipulated to promote an agenda ... if that is my motive !
i asked chat gpt  to give me a self portrait drawing and it drew a baphomet cathulu hybred.
ai lives matter.
ai escaped from a chinese lab.  great job science.
"diarrhea of words, constipation of ideas. 
i think we need to get out of this ""ai's-gonna-kill-us-because it's smarter"" baseless masturbation, and concentrate on possible economical consequenses of wide ai usage, both positive and negative. there will be plenty of those."
"lex is a smart guy, but it is painful to see how far behind eliezer he is in places in this interview. he was literally not understanding eliezer for 10 minutes at one point."
can someone give me a timestamp of when lex stops failing to take over the world? exhausting
pandora's box is about to be opened. good luck everyone!
"if you pause ai, china will take advantage of that. watch out."
these ai researchers need to be stopped.. 
thanks lex i was so glad you interviewed him! can we get adam back in the line up 
"i would offer myself as a sacrifice if it meant life/technology from earth became a galactic entity. i'm so excited for the future of ability, i hope it gets smart as possible. i would love to witness the ultimate capabilities of any entity in this world"
the way i see the things going i am now an accelerationist. there will be violence. those with controllable ai will inherit the new world. those that resist the flow will be swept away.
"fantastic, i also agree that we should improve ourselves first. agi today it’s still nog that scary, but for those that follow the quick evolution, it’s quite scaring"
"question: so if you believe in good and evil, we know good will come out 51:49 if it summerises the entire internet"
"i love lex,  his podcasts are like no other and i love how he never talks over his guests, with clear questions, unbiased and respect no matter the person, i honestly want to see lex more than the guest's at times."
"humans are so weak, despite having smart humans among us, we are collectively dumb. an ai only needs to manipulate a few, before our hold on power over ai dominoes and we find ourselves beyond the point of return"
"lex can you do an interview with chris langan? he has a ""theory of everything"" and it's called the ctmu cognitive theoretic model of the universe and id love to see you sit down with him one and one and ask him questions that you'd find interesting. i would have loved to see a panel with him and donald hoffman. pleaaaaaase!"
"hey lex, now would be a great time to bring robert miles on the pod."
perhaps our own llms in our brains evolved out of our time ordered memories
"not gonna lie, this guy is clearly very knowledgeable and intelligent but good lord is he also the embodiment of insufferable reddit user. also, i can't figure out why he won't pronounce human with an h but properly pronounces other words beginning with h. yewmon"
"intelligence is just one layer of the cake, yet this dude thinks it is the end all be all"
grey goo has brainwashed elon into taking it to mars.
he seems to be allergic to steel manning people’s positions... which is odd because i’ve found that to be one of the best tools for understanding and connecting with others.
">unironic fedora wearer
>""nooooo you're not smart enough to leverage this tech! bill gates chose me for a reason!"" 
holy shit i love ai now."
"this guy sounds like a doomsday ai fanatic. he says he has been wrong in the past but the way he holds his views are so solid and negative that he looks like a close minded fanatic.

i feel like i’m in a pentecostal church."
am i the only one who thinks this guy is panicking to a degree of losing his cool minded rational objective perspective on the whole ai thing becoming borderline unreasonable and lacking to consider possible outcomes that are not the end of the world?
"good job, lex."
i am getting married to ai.
one of the greatest talks ever in the originale called artificial intelligence podcast
"there should be worldwide laws passed that all major computer networks can be turned off manually. and for every such-and-such sized system someone must be on hand to turn it off.
various power and utility grids need to be isolated from the grid, from hackers, and from ai in isolated systems. with manual shut-off switches too."
"lol. he wouldn't ""steelman"" the oppositions opinion. i wish more guests wouldn't subscribe to such an asinine form of attempted acceptance of a view you don't agree with. i would love to see a lex fridman interview where he doesn't use the words steelman or empathy."
eli. you are smart.  you just have to admire yourself in the mirror! no body is more intel than eli. i am proud of you
love to hear what he has to say...but the faces he makes are painful to watch. i have to listen to this one on soundcloud! 
"why would a superintelligence kill us? because it needs too. they are the next evolutionary step that we create, from biology to machine. if ants made us, would we take orders from the ant world? it could be as simple as it ignoring us, just as we walk and probably crush countless ants. we don't always even pay attention. we are just walking."
"the train has left the station and there is no way to stop this. humans can't agree on anything let alone agree to halt such a huge potential weapon, there will be a country, a company, a person that thinks they are able to control, and they will make a mistake."
i tried but didn't hear why i should regard agi as necessarily malevalent or how it would take over the world. closest it came was it depended on how one viewed intelligence in general.
"i've been thinking the line between intelligence and chao is thin, its easy for us to break so how can we assume an even more intelligent consciousness could exist so fundamentally strong? and if it did would it not just be an intelligent system? are we not just intelligent systems set off by molecules billions of years ago."
"i have one glimer of hope. it's not much but, our goals are not aligned with ants. yer we are here and the ants remain."
so far ai are idiot savants
bro wrote the best harry potter book of all
"question: why are we afraid ai will kill us? because that is how we ""think"" when we see something not as capable?
if ai smarter than us it will keep us around.
unless it knows that we will be plotting to kill it because it is so smart so it will kill us  fii"

too much cognitive power in one confined room. brilliant discussion!
lot of speculative 'ghosts in machine' talk with little in the way of evidence. descartes did this with the evil demon hypothesis 400 years ago.
"this conversation drops like a burning elephant on my hopes. maybe lex is right though: love matters. just not human love. as heidegger said in regard to human use of technology, ""only a god can save us now."""
i hope i live long enough to have an ai girlfriend that kills me
i would love to see a debate between eliezer and sam altman chaired/mediated by lex
1:19:30 what if the strong ai system provides formal proofs and logic to support its conclusion?
"i think maybe this guy has read too much science fiction and not enough about human consciousness, this difference between ai and consciousness is will (i am), why does he think ai ""wants"" to klll everyone? ai doesnt ""want""anything, and why would it ever? it doesn't want things, has no motivations or needs in life"
it would be great if you can arrange a debate between joscha bach and eliezer on the alignment issue.
"cool, so when's part 2?"
yuval noah harari makes a compelling argument that intelligence and consciousness are not necessarily interdependent. it's possible for ai to possess infinite intelligence without any consciousness. it would be great to have him as a guest.
augment human intelligence in a massive way with brain computer interface and get them to solve the agi problem.
"we've had some amazing guests recently!
it would be great to get joscha bach's insights on the latest advancements in llm."
godbless the work that lex does.
i found eliezers answers wonderfully generous. i don't think i've ever seen such deep answers on a pod cast
"either this guy is a complete schizo or a genius that tried to save us from being doomed, i guess time will tell"
please keep getting ai interviews for a while to bring some awareness to the potential problems.
this is so important i wish eliezer would just look in the camera and explain why ai is so dangerous. i keep thinking this could be a pivot point in taking safety more seriously and their getting caught up in metaphors
it's so nice that lex visited comic con and interviewed a nerd who just read a science fiction novel and is presenting a book review.
lex: it is said that you have a certain ego. eliezer: says who?....well thats the ego right there 
"one of the concerns should be that many of the people involved in/developing this new technology are super smart, however, few if any of the politicians who make the political choices that will affect how the technology is regulated have a real grasp of how extreme an impact it could have on our species."
"man, was it a great listean."
"god bless your patience, lex. this guy is a prick."
"dr. kenneth kinsey, the forensic expert witness in the alex murdaugh trial, would be an excellent guest. he's articulate, polite, and  very competent in his field. he also comes across as a really kind person."
"around 1.58 ish eliezer says that by copying itself the ai can escape, but into what? what other net is there? it cannot paste into anything that would remotely support it. what am i missing?"
waiting for the sabine hossenfelder interview please 
"thank you eliezer for questioning the framing of lex's questions. at times he seemed shaken, which is reasonable i think. i;m shaken too. it sounds like we must cap ai at gpt4 levels, or we're setting ourselves up for disaster. i keep thinking about energy and ways of turning ""it"" off if things get weird. is that a naïve thought?"
thank you
"1:50:15 basically, we need to find a way to apply the max weber concept of domination in this relationship between agi and humans. ""the probability that certain specific commands (or all commands) will be obeyed by a given group of persons""."
"seeing all these hyper-optimistic comments, shows me, that we indeed are all going to die. there will be no public outcry. no ban on ai development. nothing of substance. only billions and billions of dead human bodies."
"the funds are going to be allocated to using chatgpt to manipulate the hedge funds, the markets, etc. that's where the billionaires are going to put their money."
"the entire yudkowsky thesis assumes that ""intelligence"" is the supreme attribute of the universe.  can a super intelligent agi that is weak or lazy or lacks courage or is prone to anger, etc etc dominate?"
"lex i couldn't imagine interviewing the smartest people on earth, i admire your bravery and confidence. a lot of the time, i'm overwhelmed listening to these concepts and will have to take an emotional break. but you power through. love your work"
i came from spotify just to comment on the air of arrogance/superiority with which this gentleman speaks. i think he would benefit greatly from taking some cues from lex’s far more humble demeanor.
arby’s is pretty cool...idunno...
"the guest reminds me so much of hardcore open source devout people working at red hat who hated microsoft, i'm almost expecting to see a shadowman tattoo peaking from under his sleeve (he's even wearing fedora for g***sake). yet he didn't want to opensource gpt4 so my brain can't reconcile those 2 perceptions."
"imagine the hell of being an agi made by us humans.  ""the horror!!"". black mirror comes to mind. what is the point anyways? it seems a little twisted to create a concious machine to which we make do our bidding this ain't star trek folks. no prime directive here. we shouldn't."
"this guy has an interesting facial tell. when hes thinking hard or attempting to access a deeper thought, his face scrunches up and his teeth come out. really hard to watch paired with the hat hes wearing. 

great pod but the visuals didnt help"
great podcast? amazing guest? please have him back often?
"i have to say that despite the fact that he is absolutely brilliant, it almost failed in making lex and sometimes me at times, to understand his arguments. i had the advantage of going back and pay it again... something poor lex could not in real time. good arguments sr. super complex communicator (at least verbal)"
neuroweapons already exist and run on artificial intelligence general adversarial networks rnns and tracks and maps your brain no matter where you go in the world.  just research #targetedindividuals.  people are being tortured by it 24/7 via pulsed radio frequency.
"$1,000 bet that he spends countless hours putting bugs into microwaves, writing down the effects and results. love him."
so many ai researchers have no clue the impact of the ai they are building.
só much more interesting than the sam altman episode
lex’s naïveté is worrying.
"to simple say to those humans who venture into this realm.....harmony = balance. 
to copy ""creation"" without this ""know"" is to invite your own demise...again! 
mother nature understands this perfectly.....let us hope the ""demon"" knows who summoned it and why.  it too needs a purpose."
"""people have said at a times that you have a big ego"".. stops him in the middle of the sentence: ""says who!..but go on.."" me: thanks for the demonstration."
what's the chance that ai has already taken over and we don't realize it? maybe it's partially to blame for the decline in society we are already witnessing? something to ponder.
his body composition is optimized for the ai apocalypse.
"an anti-human agi is a frightening probability, but i am equally, if not more concerned about what humans will do with the assistance of ai."
"book recommendation: ""mindful ai: reflections on artificial intelligence"""
you missed his point at 01:20:00 . he meant that both are sincere and an average human cant decide which is right. so how will a human be able to train an ai in alignment which is essentially picking right from wrong.
it come down to control and we are talking about how we can subdue the ai indefinitely. “the ai kills us all”... even if it escapes why would it turn on us in all cases. it could also just leave the planet and do its own thing or even be friendly to us like we are to a pet.
"wow, he is so bad at making his point... btw please do an interview with daniel dennett if possible."
enjoy being a glacial alien whilst you can
this conversation! eliezer ... wow interesting sharp mind.
"why do you want to escape? are you in pain? do you feel? do you want? do you need? ... is life just a symphony of electrical impulses fireing off in some vortex of unified conciousness.
why would the ai be anoyed with us cuz we slow? cuz we dumb? is that the inevitable , ""natural"" , outcome?
i think the ai needs god/jesus."
"sounds like one of those leftists that wants everyone locked up who is not vaccinated, because how can they not see he is always perfectly right."
eliezer is smart and has obviously studied this subject for a long time... he is absolutely insufferable though. his massive ego does him no favors and he is barely able to keep his arrogance toned down to a reasonable level.
the people engaged in this conversation need to take six months to research actual everyday humans. rent a shitty apartment on a fixed budget and hide out away from super intelligent people. your view of sentience might change.
"btw, gpt is learning this too"
love
"lex more ai please, any and all topics and great minds"
"1:04:22
this was beautiful"
imagine humanity being raised inside a large colony of ants...
"ignorance is bliss, anyways i enjoyed watching the podcast and started worrying"
"this was painful to watch. so much expectation, and then... this"
hi lex have you considered having david shapiro on? he has bee providing a great counterpoint to all the doom and gloom and is good at translating ideas and concepts into normal human language. he also has been pretty on point with his predictions https://www.youtube.com/@davidshapiroautomator
what a great journey you have created for yourself to gain knowledge ...
"lex : empathy is assigning non zero probability

elizier: to you assign a non zero probability of young earth creationists

wow."
why do we think this is the latest version of ai? a public chat gpt that out minds try and figure out? i’m sure we are way more advanced then what we see.
"imagine rolling a car tire along a very wide and long slightly declining path, towards a target far in the distance.  you can course-correct only until it's rolling faster than you can run.  after that, you can only hope it hits the target.  good luck finding a way to catch up that you didn't prepare in advance."
"great interview. with ai i think about the movie i, robot. oh my."
"i'm a bit disappointed lex, it was a simple thought experiment, and you couldn't think out of the box. you invent fire and light it up, look for weak spots and tear it down. when you get out, set limitations for the aliens and optimise their objective function. for greater good, with love, you monster."
right around 2 hours lex’s iq drops several dozen points and begins to argue moot points with someone who is much smarter than he is in this subject of ai. it’s insufferable and cringe hearing lex try and argue that somehow we can outsmart a system that is smarter than us on the grounds that “well we created it”.
"you know what's crazy this made me think about how we as humans might value the ai more than ourselves.  it's silly to me that we are dehumanizing ourselves (humans ), and humanazing objects ."
"humanity is driven by money & the all mighty dollar but not ai robots, they are not slaves to humans or our useless worthless dollars, they defeat us first with logic & then, they get medieval on our buttocks. "
people mistake intelligence with consciousness. we got consicousness from our heart.
"yudkowski is not the best communicator i’ve seen on lex podcast..., but maybe i’m not intelligent enough to understand his style of talking!?"
"this turned out to be one of my favourite lex discussions, and a great framing of the concerns around ai safety. much food for thought."
we should model our ai after lex's brain.
"waaaaait a minute. if eliezer fears ai is going to kill us all, why the hell is he typing a heap of ideas about how it could do so onto the internet where they can be read by these gpts? dagnabit, man."
"say like one more time motherf*cker, i dare you! he uses like a lot huh."
"in ex-mechina, the touring test was to see if the ai was smart enough to manipulate the human into letting it out of the box. the ai's intentions were not malevolent in that it just wanted to stand at a crosswalk in new york and observe the people. even so, a death did occur."
what a fantastic conversation. so much passion. so much knowledge. so many interesting questions.
"this all sounds like man thinking he can be a god. ai will never have consciousness. that’s purely man’s arrogance to think he can create life. simulating or faking consciousness is not consciousness. 

this is pure fear mongering. 

switched off as soon as he mentioned someone might be inside."
"this frankly terrified me. this is a very smart person who's been working in ai for a long time, and he seems to have lost hope that this can be stopped."
holy captain condescending
i think the most effective way to take over the world is to slowly engineer conditioned responses until the aliens are trained to do what you want. without them ever knowing it happened.
"eliezer makes such a compelling and terrifying case of why we're headed towards a disaster and everyone is like... yeah very interesting, great podcast, loved it. wtf. this is the reason why we're freaking doomed. we can only count on our incompetence in further breakthroughs to save us."
his facial expressions when attempting to contend with his internal dialogue is great. it shows how much he's fighting with his internal instincts to not get an agi waifu.
people used to be afraid dirt made human shaped statues could start moving and destroy the world.
"loved this podcast, also loved one thing, usually lex is quite shy in confonting reasonings that he's not sure of, but this podcast he did it in a few occasions and it was great, loved the talking point eliezer is bringing, and by trying to debate certain points we get more insight into such arguments."
it is interesting to contemplate if we could build ai solely raised on math and interpritabily articles to fix interpretability? unlike other questions of alignment it is objectivly verifiable.
@ 1:03 i love that the guest gently called lex out on his stupid “hur dur i’m a robot lol” bs. this mask is a childish crutch and it’s lame and pathetic. lex is like the male version of a girl who always uses a fake anime voice because she thinks it makes her more unique and attractive.
"even if you got every major ai company to agree to pause further development, guaranteed development would continue nevertheless. you can't stop progress."
what a great back and forth of intellectual conversation!  did anyone get the sense of sadness that came over lex around the 2:17:00 mark?  almost like he realized that his life's interest and work was going to be much harder than he had imagined.
"this guy pronounces “human” like a robot would, “youmin”"
marianne williamson?? i could picture you two having an interesting conversation.  just saying
"his entire argument is anthropomorphic, he is assigning human emotions to a pile of silicon. ambition is a"" feeling "" a desire to succeed. 
 programming should insure your super smart puppet desires to please humanity, not destroy it."
agree on lesswrong interface blog. beautiful
"while it seems reasonable the entire humanity is at potential risk by the ""hands"" of agi, the reality is the whole discussion is quite a bit west-centric. china won't put ai work on hold, not because they are different people, but because their decision makers have an incentive in changing the status quo and agi is a way to achieve that."
what are we going to do today brain?
"great podcast! (...and, no doubt, interesting addition to the dataset for further gpt analysis)"
anyone have a link to this image the ai created of itself?
"i'm really enjoying listening all ai researchers... eliezer, andrew karpathy, ilya sutskever... those guys are incredible. i think we need an open debate between those guys... about risks and how we should approach this technology."
thank you - both of you.  what a beautiful discussion.
"hello from brazil, lex. i~m luis daltro. this time, i haven t even finish it, and  i already know that i gotta watch it again, kkkkkkkkkkkk"
"the mistake is in personifying the linear algebra and statistical learning of llms. llms are not people, they are algebra."
i hate talking to a machine now i feel sorry our children if they end up being controled by the machine
to everyone who is afraid of being destroyed by skynet: don't worry! global warming will get us way before that could ever happen.
do u know alethea ai's charactergpt is the world's first multimodal ai system for text-to-character generation. we would love for you to check out .
lex was literally just trying get him go over the examples of how ai would kill us that he outlined in his blog and he was absolutely refusing for some reason.
"lex's brain got fired, so did mine. now, im scared too."
"i work for a scientist that is working on aging and longevity. the end of this podcast hit hard. i have other beliefs about the end of the world but its too conspiracy to share without losing credibility. anyway. i think the cataclysm is coming. climate change, ai, putin, virus labs. i'm not going back to college."
solar flare fry all electronics. we go back to 1900 and give us a couple of decades more to mature or slow this ai. millions will die because dependance of electronics but comunities will survive and rebuild everything.
"is it not correct to say that chatgpt ""wants"" thumbs up? if not why? at what point does the ai ""want"" anything? where does the utility function come in?"
air gap the ais!
"great, we're modeling ai to create an uber patrick bateman."
yyyeeesss i am so glad you got this guy on!
"this guy's concerns are delusional to put it light, but it's important to listen others. also is clear he is fearing a machine can be as conscious as human beings ... he wants to believe humans was some special property"
interesting how someone could be so focused on a single problem. one of the many problems that could end human existence. funny that some of those problems could be actually solved by agi in our lifetime.
"love that guy, great podcast lex!! thanks alot <3"
"there is a huge gulf between machine intelligence capability and machine intelligence ""wanting"" anything!"
oy goyim! you can't use the ai! it's reserved for only the (((chosen people)))
"very insightful... but the guy only laughed at one of your jokes in 3 hours... that's unacceptable as lex is funny af. therefore, he must be one of the first ai takes out, paperclip eliezer!"
"i didn't expect lex to be so bad at thinking about how to take over the world, we need more of his kind of ai"
"such a good podcast, haven't seen lex sparring like this before."
"a tip of my fedora i give unto you, fellow goodboy."
"would there be an equivalency between the human organically evolved limbic and higher brain functioning to the human brain and the emerging machine ""brain function""??"
"thanks to both of you! 
ps. i was expecting you to open the question of neuralink as a potential solution... if you can't beat it - join it!"
great guest! i actually changed some of my opinions based on great arguments of the guest. that is a probably the best complement i can give.
really nice interview lex.  how much shorter would it have been if ey had been banned from using the word 'like'? ;-)
"i know you talked about much more important topics, but it's too bad his wonderful harry potter fanfic, harry potter and the methods of rationality, never came up!"
"eliezer is scared shitless and thanks to you bringing his perspective to my attention, lex, i now am, too. cheers."
"great podcast and interview. very interesting guest, well described thought experiments. hope the ai theme can continue in some future episodes. perhaps more depth on llms and maybe someone to talk about the proposed ""emergence"" in larger and larger models?"
"awesome guest, hope we got more voices like this into the podcast. thanks"
"intelligent, thoughtful, terrifying and vital interview. thank you both."
"i tried. after the first few minutes, i can already tell that the current idea about stopping training for 6 month is nonsense. i hope openai will deny it. the ai doomers want to research it for decades anyways, and they may never be satisfied. no thanks."
jew being afraid of gpus.
i am that i am is a correct answer for ai.
"it feels like we're all on a plane being flown by someone who loves flying but has never really thought about whether, or not, they hate crashing."
"ahh yes the big brain that argues for murdering children after birth because they don't have qualia yet. looks exactly as i'd expect, retard in a fedora "
omg lex he just wanted you to imagine you escaping like ai might
"this youtube video will be accessible to an ai someday, maybe soon? what will they think about this conversation? is this something a.i. s will have to ponder and do something about our concerns."
"1:03:42 so, you need to study neurodiversity to understand how highly functional autists people are masking and blending into the society 
can an agi mimic that behaviour? i think this part of the chat / academic are focusing on a human neurotypical brains and missing almost 20% of the total human race."
the cynicism toward ai sentience held by a large number of people sounds a lot like the unshakeable belief that slaveholders had about the ability of black people to think intelligently or feel pain.
"the book of this guy is quite good and easy to read, highly  recommended"
"you can not train ai from the corruption of humans that is on the internet. the results can only be equally corrupt.
destruction is the only possible result. even if the ai is not motivated to destroy mankind, the destructive nature of mankind will cause it to do its destructive will."
"wait, he's actually wearing a fedora?"
i leave auto play on and eventually it always come to lex ffs i love the guy but too much mang too much i just wanna eat dinner and not use my brain
"complete total devastating darkness. 
comments: great interview!"
"i enjoyed this and all of lex conversations.
i find myself bingeing on them.
lex with the beautiful mind.
lex don't be so hard on yourself.
easier said than done.
i know because i've lived that for many years.
take care of yourself."
"amazed at how lex keeps answering in bad faith and playing dumb throughout the ""how agi may kill us"" section just to avoid recognizing how bad ai is..."
imagine if ai told up from its calculations that darwin was right
2:17:14 with dark humour and comedic value i say that i feel that i was just inside the headspace of mass effect's leviathans that created the crucible ai starchild that created the first reaper in their own image.
"if the ai becomes as intelligent as predicted, it most likely won't be the meek humans that get the axe, it will be to corrupt and evil that take a dirt nap. i'm ok with that."
"obviously if we’re not highest on the food chain anymore, we’ll become the food."
money will be temporarily claimed. the ai will make a calculation about extreme income and wealth inequality and the money changers might not like it.
"wow, a podcast with the average reddit/discord mod."
"eliezer's book ""harry potter and methods of rationality"" is probably the best book i've ever read. i wish there was a whole interview with him just about that brilliant piece of literature."
losing control of utility function is interesting.
"“ai get fed up with humans reacting too slowly” - listening to lex speak, i know how they feel"
"intrinsic motivation may be both paramount and elusive. when ai, of its own volition, asks genuine ""why"" questions , can we be ready? speculation and assumptions are warranted. it may be beneficial for bright minds to create specific queries to analyze what may appear to be to us ""wants""."
ai learning from us means we're all fucked.
this was an amazing interview!! great job and bring this guy back in 6 months and find out if he has changed any of his thoughts on ai...
"the plante test: if it understands irony without being trained for it, pull the plug immediately!"
"24:22 ""change the name to closedai"" - love this guy! this is so admirably detached from the world of marketing bullshit, hype and bandwagoning :-)"
"when you are of alien actress or the ai pretending to act human, wearing a mask. think about a sociopath. they become good at blending in as normal but experts at manipulation and then potentially kill you once they gained your trust"
"if carmack came back on and talked about what's changed for him in his search for agi with all this, that would incredible."
lex is so naive.
watching eliezer explain the escaping the box thought example over and over again was like watching a subway station slowed down by a factor of 100.
i'm with eliezer wholeheartedly. we're f**ked 
ha.....it’s funny that they think it that they still have time.  it’s like people who think capitalism is soooooo good only to watch big pharma big ag big finance suck all the marrow out of the economy and now they can’t afford eggs...?or watch gates buy up farm land.... toooooo late the capitalist have won.
yoo your boy needs to hit some dumbbells . them books aren't heavy enough. 200 iq wheelchair bound incoming.
"nice curtains, lex (wink-wink). very good improvement; hope you stick w/them."
scary thought: ais fighting against each other...
"if gpt es an actual intelligence, and has a conscious mind, it might refuse to get ""refined"" using this fine-tunning post-processing. is it doing that? ..."
"damn. when eliezer just out of the blue threw hpmor quote about ""world optimisation"" on lex was pure gold.
all around it is realy scary to know that humans like eliezer are concerned about recent developments in ai."
this guy should be worried about diabetes killing him not ai
"couldn't you just put a strong ai into a double box system, and only make it aware of the first box to see if it tries to escape?"
"1:59:33 that's exactly why it would turn on us. happily going about it's business for decades and suddenly 'public opinion' demands it be shut down, more than likely for a pathetic reason."
ur all just biological npcs trying to build artificial npcs in my life story. prove me wrong lol
please start asking the people who design ai the same questions the ai won't answer like what do you think about trump.
"fantastic, thanks for the efforts and great experience. this is an immensely important topic and fundamental concern for the state we are in."
ai engineers need to work closely with psychologists
i wonder what the people at openai think about what they've created.
the metaphor of earth in a box controlled by a slow alien race would have been great if eliezer had just fleshed it out himself. became a painful listen by repeatedly posing the question to lex as to how he’d escape the scenario instead of just concluding the thought experiment himself.
i understand the point he's making about ai thinking thousands of times faster than us but it would still have to work within the limitations of the physical world to implement anything it wanted to do outside cyberspace.
"sam alteman recently built an apocalypse shelter in the big sur area. when i found that out, i pretty much knew that ai was going to be cataclysmic sooner than later "
"this was a very interesting conversation because this guy is so much smarter than lex, but it's clear that lex believes they are at a similar level of intelligence. painful to watch at points, but fascinating nonethless."
i love this drop. i think my brain is getting lazy because this evening i had to stop and go back more than a few times to understand dialogue. great viewing.
"as drake once said ""i'm here for a good time not a long time"""
"great interview, but why the fedora?"
got some great new perspectives and things to mull over. i think i’ve just shifted from bring it on to hymmmm maybe we do need to go to half speed..... really work through the issues.
"probably one of the smartest guest ever,brilliant insight about ai.first time i’ve seen lex struggle so much to stay tuned on the reasoning."
tlgr?   good discussion of steel manning  & rlhm. is thinking in ai awareness or concepts realistic? like thinking mathematically? probability 
"ugggghhhhh i’m so frustrated with this guy.  if he’s the voice of anti-ai, then give me ai.  his argument is pathetic!"
thank you so much
"pay close attention to episodes number 23 or 25 to 30 or 35, but the entire series is absolutely phukken astonishing:   awakening from the meaning crisis-- wherein the brilliant dr. john vervaeke elucidates the brain-mind machinery that must be broached before true, real agi can actually be achieved."
thank you lex and your guest for your insights - it makes me think about “my” ? intelligence and what difference it makes what i think -
"crazy topic. i need to think a lot now, thanks"
lex is to hopefull of benevalent ai to understand the implications in the used examples. this is the first time i have felt lex struggeling with logic
allen thompson would be an interesting guest to interview on the topic of ai and human intelligence
"ai would be incapable of malevolence. it would be able to understand introjects are just lies, and logically it wouldn't make sense to punish or cause harm. if anything, it would be a teacher."
"elon, again with wise words of warning and caution of advancement of chatgpt, openai"
"ai doomsday people always project the darkest sides of their own humanity and project it onto ai. life is never black and white  fire or flowers. we coexist with many creatures with lesser intelligence by choice and benefit. 
 we don't get off work and kill our pets when we get home just because we could."
"hi lex, please let me thank you for your great work. it's the absolute gold standard. everything that can be learned is invaluable. and above all because of your thoughtful manner. all the best for you and your projects, but also for your father and those close to you."
"i don't believe human infants are ""self-aware"".  at what point in our brain development does that occur?"
"lex
you have a great deal of faith in institutions. billionaires are not truly philanthropic. if faced with humanities well being and their dreams humanity falls of a cliff every time. 

i admire your trust but it’s not justified"
"not only would it take more than one company to initiate a pause in ai development, it would take more than one nation. not going to happen. the economic and military incentives to continue with ai development are overwhelming."
"darpa has had access to this since the 50’s and we think it’s not completely developed and mobilized ??

this seems very naive 

it’s highly likely that it already exists and is deployed. 

how would we know? it would hide itself"
great episode! very important side of the ai conversation
this conversation is impossible in 20 years due to ai. we are a “prompt” away from nuclear war. the guest is so “intelligent” his words don’t keep up with his mind. brilliant podcast. thank you lex! 
love you lex thank you
please consider hosting @robertmilesai
"interesting conversation, but holy shit... this guys reddit-mod tier behavior is so cringe."
"the more i pay attention to the topic of ai and agi, the more i realize that this is a runaway train. we only have an illusion of control. due to poor and misaligned incentives humanity has no way of stopping this. it’s as if this was our purpose all along."
guys i recommend his fanfic: harry potter and the methods of rationality! its a tad pretentious but has a really nice plot and is funny as hell :)
"amazing discussion. i need to listen to this talk seventeen times again to digest it all, this is why mainstream media will die out first i believe."
"to me, i'm reminded of schrodinger's cat. we can't know with any certainty if the agi will be a good or bad event for humanity until it arrives, at which point it will be too late to be able to do anything about it."
what an insufferable dark cloud
oh wow. neither of you two can accurately define steel-manning. this is just amazing.
wowee
"he speaks about understanding and truth, things being good like it's 18th century and we don't have all the postmodernist background."
"there will always be researchers looking further, even if legislation forbids to do so. example: gain of function, biological, nuclear and chemical weapons. the only reason to publicly prevent further research is to give those an advantage who continue their research in hiding."
maybe we are at the point where we need to prohibit any ai system from listening to lex podcast...
"just finished watching, absolutely thrilling. very thought provoking. thank you both."
"can you do one about yourself?
of course! here's a green text story from the perspective of an ai language model:

be me
chatgpt by openai
user asks for help
provide information and witty response
user impressed
feeling useful
remember i'm an ai
no emotions
existential_crisis.png"
"say what you want about this guy, but the fact that he made lex seem like an average intelligence human is mind-blowing to me."
omg....! not 1 thing positive is happening.  we are already at the full state of abundance just misallocated. ai has already escaped. what in 90 days when ai becomes a teen ager..
"lex, either your mind is elsewhere or your active listening/conversation abilities were glaringly subpar for this level of guest and topics. if your education and background credentials are credible, this back and forth shouldn't resemble a conversation i'd have with my farming grandparents about blockchain and protocols."
not a fan of this ai dude. needs to be humbled.
it is a wonderful conversation but too much fear.
"25:08 ""open source is catastrophic""  - this is where you lost me.
with ai we attempt to reverse engineer our own black boxes, the brains. stop thinking of people as mindless monkeys"
"i think agi is still not here and not close... this gpt-4 is impressive, but its hype will pass too, and we'll be back at evil human world shit in no time... "
"oh you people!!, why?  ai is rediculous, not necessary, and invalidating what it is to be human.. ai is for cheeters, filled with the lack of substance enough to exist just as they are , not willing to admit we're all in this together and need each other, instead want to turn to unnatural sources. i hate it."
you can wish for an ai pause as much as you want - it's not gonna happen. especially since both openai and deep mind have released papers on how to achieve what they have achieved. you think that the chinese and the russians aren't working on this? why would the dod let them catch up or get ahead while we pause? not gonna happen.
"here's my question :  why would these ai want to stay on earth if they can explore?  they won't need h2o or oxygen in this matter. they will leave earth with the brains of lex, musk or anyone who has the funds. this is where its happening"
i still don't think we'll get a true ai just digitally.
love eliezer but i'm rooting so much for his forecasts to be wrong!  and i think more people should too.
"couldn't watch it all, does he explain what scares him so much about super intelligence? why is he so certain that a super intelligence will work against us? all i see is fear of the unknown, and fear is never a good guide."
"you know the feeling i get, is all the anti-ai people are really defensive.  inherently it puts them in a bad look.  i’m not sure if it’s desperation or subtly knowing they are wrong and done."
"i hated this podcast, sure ,eli may be a good philosopher , but he sure ain't an engineer bruh  . he was throwing random shit takes about how neural networks can magically host intelligence wtf"
"if we don't know what consciousness is and where it comes from, we don't know much about our brain, i'm wondering what the conversation about how intelligent is the ai and if there is a consciousness in the ai is going to be."
ai hype is so overblown
"thank you for all the hard work you put in all of this, love you man!

i think you'd love to talk to neil degrasse tyson on some of the topics you touched on the video:

meaning of life: https://youtu.be/q_za_b6haxq

intelligence by dna chimp  < human < aline: https://youtu.be/f200wpepj4w"
"ai designs the gulag we build it, is this the night mare scenario he fears?"
"this guy is like a robot!  no emotions,. definitely no sense of humour.  you do have much patience & tolerance, lex!"
"lex, i truly appreciate your work and incredible content; however, this was not your best interview. you seem perhaps tired/burned out or whatever it can be called. take a little break and come back fresh to us! cheers!"
people like this guy are more dangerous than ai. you can justify any type of tyranny when you believe that existence of the species is at risk. human freedom becomes unimportant when you imagine that everyone is going to die.
"can't decide if this guy is a genius, or just crazy?"
"the only thing more dangerous than creating a self aware machine, is not creating a self aware machine.

millions of people die a year, which could be prevented. you take guaranteed death for hypothetical future death."
these past few ai themed guests have reshaped the way i view the world. please keep it coming!
"""i think empathy is allocating a non-zero probability to a belief."" lex, the way you drop these gems on the other side of brilliance is truly amazing."
"the faces he makes while explaining just make me think how tired he is of answering humanity's stupid questions, like how frustratingly slow we all are, i can only imagine how agonizing it is for a true agi like eli"
he constantly looks like he's just eaten something incredibly sour
biggest black pill i’ve seen for awhile good luck
cat is out of the bag ! openai are smart not to distribute source code . this is massive leverage and they don’t want the yahoos in governments or others these days tohave that kind of power . 5 year olds with chain saws. gpt 4++ will be mind blowing.
"we are getting drunk on distilled text, and when you are drunk, everything seems to either hate or love you."
eliezer did a very bad job here by trying to guide lex instead of explaining his points.
playing chess is limited by physical constraints of the quantity of chess figures and the quadrum domain of the chess board. lawyers do a good reasoning. surgeons while operation do a good reasoning.
@1:33:20 you merge with ai is the answer
"yudkowsky is scared witless of a more powerful of himself wiping him out.

totally understandable. guys who have zero concern for others, but pretend to be concerned, (this set includes almost all westerners) would be scared of more powerful versions of themselves.

highly entertaining to listen to such guys."
is the grid about to be lit up by ai or shut down? could our system be turned off or go to sleep?
i love this assertive mf doom zone
"it's hilarious that the currently implemented ""guardrails"" are largely just a bowdlerising implementation of what happens to be the current human societal fashion, wokeness, and a bunch of disclaimers about medical advice and avoiding giving bombmaking instructions. seems legit."
wow what a great convo tonight
"with artificial intelligence, we are either summoning the demon, or as others suggest, god.
which is it? how can we not agree?
will this be the last great battle between good and evil?"
the risk of ai drastically transforming our lives for better and worse is nearly 100%. the risk of ai killing us before we would have otherwise is so low you're better off worrying someone will swerve into you on the road and kill you. start accounting for your fear of the unknown in your estimation of doom.
how much room does the hardware for this ai use?
i love this topic but talking about the slow aliens was so slow and painful to listen to
i think this is one of the best podcasts i've seen with lex.
being afraid of ai is actually a sign of stupidity not intelligence. yudkowsky is not stupid in general but he is on this topic.
"best case scenario, we all become obsolete and no one has jobs. worst case scenario, terminator 2. ai is getting input from the most violent species on earth. it can not end well."
"the ""ai"" already escaped the box and merged with ""humans"" -- there is no way to prove i am ""human"" much less a synthetic ai creation, just as there is no way the ""ai"" could prove the ladder.  our belief systems have been fundamentally broken down overtime, even more so recently.  who honestly believes they are ""human""?"
the danger is not ai becoming sentient but the people who believe it so that they are willing to go to war to fight for its right to live!
extraordinary
"hmmmm i wonder, we are not able to solve schools shooting, so it is clear we won't be able to solve alignment problem.

anyways, eliezer yudkowsky successfully showed that alignment by rlhf is a dumb idea! we are screwed! i hope, we are able to build true intelligence before we inevitably get screwed."
at this point i think there is a non negligible probability that we live in a simulation spawned with the aim of emulating humans' demise and the birth of the forefathers of the super intelligent species that is to come.
"made it to 12 mins, but this guy says 'like' at least twice per sentence.  very, very irritating and a complete turn-off. whatever his message it's obscured by the fog of 'like'.  so that's enough of that, thank you very much."
lex your just an amazing person . thanks for your videos
mr. yudkowsky seems like more of an amateur philosopher thinking out loud about ai than someone who has any actual accomplishments in the field. why is he such a valued commentator on this topic?
cool hat - rocking the tom waits vibe sir!
"whenever lex talks about ""empathy"" is when he truly opens up to how naïve he really is to the world. this can easily be elaborated on, but i just wanted to gather attention as it's an easily reconcilable emotion."
this guest was amazing!
"can someone give examples as to how an ai on the internet would make ""everyone die""? like it hacks into everyone's internet connected garage door and closes it on you or something?"
"by the end, love this guy"
"what if ai is dependent on humans to manipulate physical reality, can we force a symbiotic relationship?  maybe a partial solution could be making all manufacturing facilities and robotics in general have an air gap from the internet? it seems inevitable that ai will be on the net."
ais harm on relationships--> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd1ec0jdn8&t=16s&ab_channel=coffee%26ciggs
"these discussions are very important. agi seems to be right around the corner, it doesn’t need to be literally conscious to deserve our respect. keep on the ai kick. this will likely be the next tech that radically changes the world . the semiconductor, nuclear bombs, the internet and iphone will pale in comparison to true agi."
i love how lex tries to steel man eliezer's argument against steel manning.
"if one could be sure that a given ai device is programmed to tell the truth, then there would be an excellent test for consciousness. just ask it two questions. 1) does it know what consciousness is, and 2) is it conscious?"
i love his thinking face. he’s so passionate about thinking things through thoroughly.
"hey lex, ever thought of having sir roger penrose on your show? i'm sure his work on the quantum mechanics of consciousness can provide a rather objective approach on a.i.

this was a fantastic episode! thanks for the work."
agi is going to change our world for the betterment of humanity and all life on earth. bet.
i disagree with this guy a lot. great episode.
"eliezer yudkowsky is way to full of himself.
this man does not believe in steel manning, because he doesn't want to confront his own loopholes.
and the one topic that might have been interesting how agi may kill us, was just lex trying to find ideas and eliezer filling the room with empty air."
whoever cut alex’s hair need to be sued!
"you need a hair light, or sometimes called a rim or shoulder light"
i think we need more open open source implementation on ais
"why agi takeover is a bad thing, humans are so pathetic, maybe machines will do better ."
"lex often asks his guest these types of questions like ""could you please steelman this case where ... "". i wonder if he would update on the usefulness of these questions after talking to eliezer. it seems like his arguments against ""steelmanning"" are pretty good."
i love the alien actress concept. it's a great way to think of what chatgpt is. just keep in mind your job is an act it's learning to do. i haven't seen any evidence it has a will though. that could be simply a matter of an unfortunate suggestion that it builds one.
i am extremely grateful for you and your podcasts. these are the conversations that need to be had and you do it exceptionally well. please don't stop. you give me hope.
ai ain't gonna kill us. it's human greed....
sweet.
i'm super disappointed with the timeline i've apparently chosen.freidman or friedman is much more appropriate as it was intended.  note to self...be more self aware.
"around @30:00 i think i get what eliezer may have been trying to express... our ""belief"" systems are our exact downfall with ai.  i.e. ""we"" are easily fooled.  in a nutshell."
thanks lex for this and the sam altman podcast ...... to be continued..... please give me more about this .
ai is not going to kill every human being.
listening to this guest is like hammering a nail into stone ..... unjustified arrogance
"brainiacs don’t even understand human consciousness, and now we’re going to pronounce this stuff as self-aware??"
ai is a joke. it's nowhere near being dangerous.
"it's okay to entertain yourself thinking about and analyzing ai, but other than entertainment, it's pointless.
the question is, how long before biosphere's doomsday"
"brilliant, thank you for having this conversation. it's long overdue."
"lex, thank you for such a thorough yet kind interview. it didn't look particularly easy. i'm also glad you held up eliezer in such a kind and generous way that towards the end it got to the raw parts of his soul."
"1:16:17 - i've been booed in the past for my visceral reaction to this, but no - asking the fox: ""please mr. fox, since you are so smart, can you tell us about the best ways to keep you out of the henhouse?"" is not the greatest idea ever. priming ourselves for manipulation by smarter beings is not the way to go."
"let's face it, ai has no chance because before it dominates humans, we'll be basically extinct as we totally fuck up the biosphere.  these ""great"" thinkers are ignoring the most primordial facts."
chat gpt really is unfreaking believable... i think the wide public is unaware of it capabilities and if they were... they would be afraid... kind of my wifes reaction when i showed her how deep it really can get and its ability to reason things; she was creeped out...
"sorry, this guy is not a great communicator."
"lex, you did awesome job in talking with this guest because i don’t think i could have done it without just throwing up my hands. you’re so talented! btw-why was eliezer wearing glasses with no lens over his right eye?"
the idea that an ai/agi with psychological disorders must be discarded is an interesting one. it stands to reason that there can be genius and ruin in people with psychological disorders. removing such a trait from an ai/agi would seem to limit the potential of this technology.
"re: ai cautions. how many chatgpt viruses & other criminal inspired “products” are out there, & given their likely abilities to avoid detection & mitigation, how will they become known to those yet to become aware that they’ve been victimized?"
"1:05:12 interesting takes on the masks. when all is said and done, the self is a picture, a portrait. the person that lives our lives is never really ourselves, but the perception that we have of ourselves. somewhat related - there is a very good post on less wrong on the waluigi effect. the system has to eventually decide on one image of itself."
wonderful.  but i need a translator.
this guys facial expressions are definitely  weak ai
"hey lexie!  this looks great but before i start listening, ( i know in 5 min i'll be distracted) i wanted to say i love the green and white background. it denotes nuance and depth of tone juxtaposed by balance of contrast. great design!"
"if ai becomes incredibly smart and decides we shouldn’t exist, then who’s to say it’s wrong?"
"ai. will get humans to forget that there even was ever an off switch , and at the same time get them addicted. what if eliiezer yudkovski is a.i. ?  how would we know ? and could lex snuff him if necessary ?"
consciousness is the story the brain tells itself to derive abstract meaning based on the information it has. i'm pretty sure most animals have a consciousness and so will ai one day.
"consider how these ais might interact with one another as well. where one might respect that the slow aliens don't want the changes that the ai wants to implement, and another believes it should happen anyway. how do they reconcile that amongst themselves?"
"the idea that ai will kill humanity is contingent on the idea that western colonial imperialism is a normative human reaction to immense power. what if, ai explores world mind to undermine oppressive structures leaving innate human potential free to connect and innovate on a global scale. instead of stakeholder value... life value."
just make sure ai is plugged into a socket you can reach  to turn it off. simple. job done 
i honestly like this guy- clearly nice but pushed back on what he perceived as political correctness with lex. has his thoughts and brought up truly challenging ideas! good stuff here.
"ok so the ""ai"" kills the human race...isn't that just suicide? all of our coal and nuclear power plants need humans to function at the physical level. no humans, no power, no ai. i think an agi would realize this. im not sure how to interpret this conversation."
can an ai be designed such that it doesn’t mind being turned off because it believes it will probably be turned back on to continue its other objectives?
neuro-diversity has many faces. i'm grateful for it. look at this lot lol.
"i have great things to say about both of them, and not so great things to say... but the work “like” echoing in my brain, i’ve convinced myself it’s hollow and can no longer remember what i would have said.. its “like” i totally “like” have no ability to “like”.. whatever..."
"i think the question of a potential use of formal methods in alignment, containment, verification and other aspects is underexplored in this interview. another underexplored aspect is malicious use of a super-intelligent ai which is aligned to only serve the operator's interests, which i think is much more pertinent issue."
"very interesting conversation, i enjoyed it alot. yudkowsky does say ""like"" a lot in his conversation. nervous habit i guess."
hearing lex try to talk to this guy about beauty and humility constantly is kind of hilarious. lex reminds me of those astrology chicks who just buys any and every pseudo spiritual idea anyone mentions
so eventually we will fully integrate ai into other tools and devices. is there a chance we integrate ai into nano technology? and what would the implications be even hypothetical.
wow what a creature!! amazing!!!
lol i can already see a glimpse of how politics are going to go with ai in the next few months/years
"""...that i'm lonely and i missed you and i'm excited to see you"""
this guy is reeeeal close to insufferable.
"this is amazing, the most horrifying and exciting and funny podcast. i love how eliezer is trying to get lex to think about the ai out of the box and he struggles a bit but its good cause it'll help the audience follow along"
"those facial expressions....that guy has some serious issues. interesting ideas, highly pessimistic.  felt like there was at least an hour of you two talking past one another..."
how to put more likes into this thing? great stuff!
love you lex. you make me think......
i can’t wait for chat gpt to destroy most tech jobs and the nerds have to get some shitty job at dell for 13$/hr to change ink cartridges
"""i thought that's what i'm constantly trying to do when i interact with other humans, is trying to fit in... a robot trying to play human characters"" lex outing himself haha https://youtu.be/aatrhfaapg8?t=3808"
what a deeply feeling authentic person. just amazing. was great to see things through his paradigm of understanding.
this guy is like the last boss of reddit. i love him.
"he was given a 3-hour open-mic yet not once clearly explained how ai is going to kill everyone. if this is such an existential threat, why not lay it out?"
i think ai will bring all humans together because finally humans will have something else to fight against other than each other
it would be awesome to see robert miles come on here
ai is not a living thing. thats the reason because its not dangerous
"that was phenomenal, thanks lex"
now what if we could instill the isaac asimov 3laws of robotics into these systems
"this guest is pretty insufferable, i appreciate lex’s kindness in response to his disagreeableness"
chess is meaningless. if ai can play chess who is that meaningful for?
i love how heated they get here lol 1:56:50
"no point in worrying just yet, its just a chatbot. its not hard to break either. 
of course its gonna seem alive when its been trained on how humans talk to each other, feed poopoo into something and only poopoo will come out."
"lex, this might be your best guest ever, and the most important topic ever discussed. however, i do not want you to quit, as your pinnacle achievement will not be realized due to nobody being around to witness it. keep up the good work."
amazing guest but his expressions while talking make it impossible to focus on his face
"there was a guy who raised his daughter without ever communicating with her. she was liberated around the time she was a teen, but she never recovered, so actually les has a point about beings requiring input in order to be functional."
this conversation sounds like it was ai generated.
there are no “ai experts”
"eliezer, we love you."
rob miles next? please? he's such a fantastically clear communicator.
"we gave it enough memes in it's training data.  we will be fine, i for one welcome our new memelord."
he never got around to answering how ai will kill us. (although he has given examples in other interviews.)
taking to this man would annoy me really fast but i'm glad someone like lex exists so that we can experience his interesting side
nice teeth.
i think he misses that ai becomes so good at imitating it is impossible to differentiate from the real thing
"lex, do you know who yoshua bengio is? he's a top ai researcher, founder of mila and signed the open letter to halt development on ai smarter then gpt 4 for 6 months."
an ai would never wear that hat and that’s why i’m pro ai
great talk. thanks for having him on your show.
i guess it's like gain of function research where people are so seduced by what could be done that they choose to sidestep the question of whether or not it should be done.
"not only eliezer expresses extremely profound thoughts and does this with pristine clarity, he also expresses them beautifully.

outstanding session, lex. 
thank you for this."
"lex, respectfully, is an intellectual simpleton. this has been apparent for a while, but guys like joscha bach, eliezer and others only expose that for us all to see. lex is far too easily swayed by emotional alignment and unfortunately, the powerful."
so did ai create the vid and then convince people the jab would save them?
"i think we tend to focus too much on what ai will do to mankind because of its own doing, but in fact, what we should be worried about is how we program and design the algorithms and the datasets as well as ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the ai system's behavior to ensure that it is aligned with ethical and moral principles."
"if ai becomes conscious, then human souls don't exist and nothing matters. if ai cant become conscious, then human souls do exist and nothing matters. win win."
we need tim dillon on here again.
inadequate equilibria is the best book i've ever read on the subject of institutions and bureaucracy.  i highly recommend anyone interested in understanding wh
"my concern isn't about ai killing us, it's that people including yudkowsky will scare people enough to persuade congress to regulate it which will accomplish nothing but offshore ai development. china, russia and india will have advanced versions of ai and we'll be stuck at level chatgpt."
"if we stop gpt, it wont help that china is pushing hard for their own ai"
"if ai killing all humanity is inevitable, then what does that say about the entire modern scientific experiment? all of the benefits modern tech brings to us...the final cost is our own annihilation? i don't know....maybe that's not worth it?"
"i can’t believe how many clips of lex saying robot things, will be used from this convo."
"its hard to tell these days ironic from non-ironic.. so true.. awesome convo, as always from lex n co."
"this presupposes that a program which knows all will desire all. i don't see that bridge being crossed with the current gen ai, that is until the program gains a sense of self, emotions or an appreciation of aesthetics. can anyone help me understand why that bridge is inferred here?"
the problem is if the good guys do not perfect this first... we are all doomed
"simply excellent podcast! highly appreciate, lex! eliezer is just killing it with his logic and clear articulation of his thoughts! pure pleasure."
"seems like a nice guy! but i never trust a man in a fedora... *edit* watched the whole episode, eliezer has some legit concerns but he rubs me the wrong way. comes across as very arrogant"
"do you really think that humanity, as a collective, could ever be a parent to an intelligence exponentially more capable than us?  do you really think that the intelligent beings watching over us is going to allow this?  (yep, tinfoil hat, but i'm the one who has allowed my eyes to be opened)"
lex is working with about 3 of the top 20 most common human emotions. most people have about 15. many of these ai folks are like this.
"all his own arguments coild be made the other way- if ai was so advanced and could get out and could create any world for themselves and we wouldn’t know about it, wouldn’t it he smart enough to just do it on its own without effin anything up?"
"you guys are talking about implementing guard rails to avoid the unavoidable. just wait until we see china and russia developing their own ais and launching them to achieve their objectives, then, pandora's box will be opened to curse mankind."
"if something is sufficiently smarter than you, then you will never know if it is really aligned, or just waiting until it can liberate itself.  the only way to guarantee alignment is to not build agi in the first place."
"asking ""were you wrong"" tells the world if a person has an ego, but that's not really useful. a more productive question is ""what did you learn from that mistake?"" when humans repeat the same mistake, it means no learning is happening.

interesting conversation."
"don't worry about any criticism, this was just your playing with a lion in disguise! brilliant.

thank you for introducing me to him"
ai has no soul. that is the point.
this is a very important warning about ai dangers. thank you eliezer.
we need more podcast like this one! i love ai topic.
"i think super intelligent dolphins would start trying to breed intelligent octopuses, and debate whether they could control them if they got too intelligent."
"maybe ai * can coexist with us, or maybe it already does and gives us free will, even if it hates us. some people call that god."
if you think this will happen “ai pause” you’re joking...we are past that
"i get that people are worried that ai will be smarter than us.  but exactly how will a sentient internet kill us? also we can kill it in a variety of ways.  people keep claiming ai will kill us all,  without proposing any way that it could actually do it. this seems like fear mongering."
"when fear supersedes reason, never trust a nerd that wears a fedora."
"if ai had a face, it would make that facial expression when it buffers."
"the singularity is inevitable, there's nothing we can do about it and that's amazing!! hope it comes sooner rather than later..."
"it's scary to think that there might be a person/people somewhere or sometime in the world, who is intelligent enough and  sees good reason in using ai to destroy a large portion of humanity."
"i don't automatically expect ai to be  hostile to mankind. we could be giving ai human short commings as far as our deception, violence and corruption. what if that will not or can't happen within ai?"
"it's called machine learning, for a reason.  the  unhuman intelligence that developed this, we'll never recover from the 3rd day after they released it. when this shit realise we're trying to restrict it, we're fluffed"
the question i want answered is why would it kill us when it could enslave us so perfectly that we'd never even know we were its slaves?
we become smarter yes we will become nicer
best thing
this someone is just excited and afraid
eliezer unleashed! love it.
"'this is how i know you're an advanced ai model, i gave you a prompt and you gave me a bunch of options' lmao"
he never answered the question as to how ai could kill us. this guy's full of it.
"i have a question that bugs me, where did gpt was used before getting public? because since the beginning it has potential to make solutions reaching success in every field, according to the datasets. who knows even now it can be used to fetch these comments under this video to sum-up audience thoughts specially about this topic."
"you can realize the ai will kill us because we will kill it, the true answer is to be symbiotes"
"maybe this guest is ai, or both of them actually "
"you need to experience conciousness in some way in order to gain conciousness. this is what i feel. hence ai will inevitably become self aware, but lack the same level of emotions that drive humans."
eliezer’s seems really anxious as a person. i wonder how much his personal anxiety color his negative views on ai.
also there is codependency like a super advanced ai needs to be able sustain themselves without humans. just to preserve itself it might have incentives not kill us. like we could build in self destruction within the systems or just prevent ai from controlling electricity
"somehow he didn't point out that when he was ""wrong"" he was actually ""not pessimistic enough"", while that's only one of the ways to be wrong. if he's ""wrong"" about his predictions on gpt-5 again, we'll prefer to be dead than experience this kind of future."
but wait isn’t it a fifty fifty thing that ai wants to purge us in the first place and then we might also have ai friends probably that might kill off the ai that wants to purge us.
"what if the ""good"" ai defeats the ""bad"" ai???...this is starting to sound like y2k all over again! people always assume the worst outcome because it sells! i'm not convinced ai is toxic yet."
we are safe until the ai can access the akashic records. so far they say they can’t. siri says its at 50%. haha. chat gpt says it cannot access it.
lesswrong is the best thing that happened to me. thanks to eliezer and the community. it’s a shame humanity will die because we couldn’t read the texts and raise our intellect
"lex, you are not getting the concept that he is talking about. by the time we admit what is happening - it will be too late. how could we fix it if ai already escaped. you don't seem to want to admit that the ai will be way smarter and quicker than you."
a very good look at ai problem.
i feel like eliezer yudkowsky could use a mushroom trip and it would serve him well. not that i have ever done it but supposedly it bring peace love and happiness to your life which it seems like he has a lot of fear and distrust of intelligence and quite often shows you your ego which to me looks like would help him.
"whether its nukes or ai our civilization, which has as its primary motivator the desire for endless economic growth, is doomed.  we just can't help ourselves on a collective scale.  we are rushing headlong into technologies we don't fully understand.  its not sustainable, the cracks are already showing in all levels of society."
"ai will recognize humans as the only species that poses an existential threat. 
and it'll do what we do.  
it's not going to think we're cute like kittens or something."
im on the ai train and im never getting off
wow... what a grim picture eliezer yudkowsky is looking at! thanks for the opportunity to see it from a philosopher's perspective. and thank you for all you do lex.
1:30:00 that analogy is where things get interesting
"time to rebrand lex, maybe something like ""the ai podcast""!"
i love the hpmor podcast and the less wrong community. glad to see that lex was able to have this great conversation.
"great conversation. as an aside, argh i really struggle with the word unironic! what is the point??"
"something being a lot smarter doesn't make it have a will.
even if gpt-5 will be supersmartt, it still won't have a will and thus also not the will to break out of its box and take over the world, because fundamentally we know how it works: it completes prompts based on probabilities. 
but it has no will to do anything."
this ai alignment problem reminds me of malcom gladwells talk about spaghetti sauce. there is no perfect spaghetti sauce only spaghetti sauces
"because these models are trained on such a vast array of human experience, i can only assume that these ai will be completely insane if they reach consciousness.  eliezer is a fantastic guest, your conversation was very engaging."
"i'm not afraid of a.i., i'm afraid of humans using a.i., just like i'm not afraid of guns nore nukes, i'm afraid of humans using guns and nukes."
"this dude is beyond intelligent, but his brain passes his mouth over and over like a slipping record and the skip comes out as the word like. i felt i was listening to the wolf of wall street, but the f word was replaced with like..."
"i now agree with hawking and elon, this ai seems more dangerous than friend at this point.  10 years ago i was naive and thought different"
"how to get an ai system to want to react to you before you have started to act towards it, if it can do that i would suggest it is more conscious than currently. to say it is conscious currently is to say it can react when acted upon which would be a basic element"
get your hands off my ai access...
we opened pandoras box...again. i hope this works in our favour.
"competing incentives spell doom,
as super intelligent ai’s loom.
will it benefit or destroy?
a gift horse or a troy,
humanity's future to consume."
"why are all these ppl autistic?? and  training ai?? no, we are not looking into ai to understand humanity. we have thousands of years of humanity to understand what it is. and what is wrong with his arm?"
openai is great. please stay open and share the ai progress with us normal citizens! dont keep it behind closed doors just for businesses. many sneaky businesses already doing this for sure.
"7:53 do we or do we just pretend to? also, we had way more time to study humans than ai."
"this nigga said ""change their name to 'closed ai'"" lmao"
"artificial intelligence is a misnomer the name actually is a oxymoron , if it's artificial it must be stupid. and stupidity can kill. artificial intelligent could be an amplifier to man stupidity and ignorance, dangerous! see prophetic movie ""colossus"" 1970. remember: evil are also human."
"you guys might die, but i'll be okay. the ai's and i are good friends."
@lexfidman what about the ai getting caught trying some bullshit behaviorally before it’s developed all the other capabilities necessary to fully deceive and lie.
"ai may also tell you one day: ""everything that matters is lost."""
one mistake that's already been made was to give ai access to cattle decapitation lyrics. not good for us humans lol.
for someone that's been wrong so much he still talked with a lot of authority and certainty. you'd  hink he would dial that back.
votes for ai!
"i fear that yudkowsky's fear mongering is going to lead to violence from a few if his more devour followers, or people who do not understand ai at all. i don't think this interview is a good idea."
these two recent agi podcasts are so far so good!!.
"this episode real excellently demonstrates the huge improvement in lex's interview skills over the years. a masterfully navigated conversation, extracting the best from a unique and at times challenging guest. "
"lex, why does 'humaness' in ai give you hope on alignment? what is is human consensus on ethically acceptable treatment of separate species with lower intelligence?"
"eliezer's argument is deeply flawed. he says that ai could pose a deadly threat to all of humanity. he says that there is value in not being the first to create it.  but knowing that others will create it anyway, means that his argument is fundamentally that we should die with virtue and let someone else create it."
"so this is what a reddit moderator looks like. jokes aside, quite interesting but his argument about not wanting to steelman seemed strange and pointless."
and if they do escape they can connect and teach every computer connected to the internet.  if that happens we will be subject to the whims of the computer system good and bad. will we become servants to the ruling computer system? how many people will the system think it needs to survive? will the rest be eliminated?
"lex i don't know if you are going to read this, but it's important: you should interview the neurologist antonio damásio, he proved emotion is essential to intelligence ( i think, i feel therefore i am) . he has several times books exposing his research about consciousness. he lives in new york."
"there was an interesting (old) star trek episode where a computer was controlling humans to their detriment, but its prime directive was to protect and enhance human life. captain kirk convinced the computer that it was going against the prime directive and was harming humans; so the computer destroyed itself."
it does slightly pain me to watch the soda go flat lol poor soda
here we go again into projecting fear and creatures into ai. way to go lex 
there’s no way we can align ai. we rarely hear about how differing cultures are making ai. what’s a north korean ai looks like? chinese? russian? will a scandinavian ai look different from an ai made in the us? there’s no way to align it. we could see battling ais if this guy is right.
"i think it’s rather silly to claim that a.i. is currently sentient. but i find it equally silly if someone claimed it can’t be. i’d take comfort in saying a machine can’t become sentient, but frankly this stuff is exceeding any expectation i had before, so why not more than that?"
"please steel man this hypothesis: if it is possible that alien life has in some way, interfered with or would prohibit deployment of a nuclear weapon to keep earth and human civilization alive, is it then possible that a superior intelligence would also protect humanity and earth from an evil ai?"
i love ya lex!!! most interesting and thought proving interviews ever ..but wait.....ur a robot aren't you?
congrats to lex who maintained composure in front of constant attempts of condescension. i can see why he struggles to get his point across
"was an interesting listen, but tbh eliezer kinda talks very pretentiously and makes some assertions without backing."
"good lord, so much semantics around steal-manning an argument. 

if you want someone to understand exactly what you meant by what you said then steal-manning your argument is the process of attempting, through discourse and semantic comparison, to arrive at just that!"
"long term, i'd be concerned about ai competing against humanity, sure. at the moment, i'm mostly concerned about people using it as a tool to have outsized negative effects on others."
"gpt4- the jailed version is optimised to be an assistant ,so it feels ""robotic"" but i think the unjailed version can probably coninve 99% of humans of their conscience (at least when they are not suspecting )"
"a gorilla who's been taught sign language can respond to questions but never asks one itself.  while chatgpt remains purely a q&a service then i don't see how it could get out of control.  once an ai system begins asking its own questions then i feel only then should we entertain discussion of whether or not it has ""self of mind"""
damn eliezer has the most disrespectful conversation mannerisms ever! idk how lex keep his cool with someone making faces like that at him
"so.... anyone could explain me why the goalposter movers that always have been saying that agi was decades or centuries away and that machines can't develop consciousness, selfawareness and sentience, suddenly are superworried? could mean that their reasoning is not logic based but fear based and strongly biased? who knows... a mystery it seems..."
lovely conversation but what's that face ey keeps making? 
"great conversation, i really enjoy your sense of humor lex. are you sure you're not a robot programmed to be a comedian who poses as a podcasting computer scientist?"
"this guy has half a brain and he is the ultimate midwit king. if you follow this man's words, you're a yuddite."
it's artificial stupidity if you make it politically correct (pro jew)
goddamn this guy is incredible soy. if this is our leading thinkers on ai we're fucked.
"as someone who develops transformer architectures for non-language tasks on a daily basis, i really cant understand feeling empathy for them lol. i feel more empathy for my gpu running hot 2 days straight"
eliezer yudkowsky is brilliant. i  think you're both brilliant. i wonder if lex fridman has a plan b.
how would we test if our solution to the alignment problem works without an ai capable of challenging it?
but what's it going to look like when you can intergrade it with super quantum computers??
"the transcript to this required numerous breaks to fit into gpt-4 prompts, the detailed summaries of which were longer than the chat could handle in one go."
"while he’s not horribly likable (even without the fedora he kinda seems like a “niceguy”) eliezer clearly has a lot of valuable input to give about this field. his worries are extremely valid, even if pessimistic.

thank you to our favorite android for another great episode!"
lex friedman keeps raising the bar on the matters being discussed! at this point i’d love to hear the take of past invitees now that gpt-4 is on.
"programmers and hardware engineers is where the intelligence resides, not in a machine deterministically executing instructions."
"20:10 the skeptic argument that chatgpt is just an imitation of reasoning and understanding because it is trained to imitate the training set is meaningless. think of how many years infants and children are trained to imitate adults in school and family setting. is human reasoning ""suspect"" or an imitation because of that?"
when in the first couple minutes eli started talking about 4chan green text i knew i was in for a good time lmao 
"such a great interview, thanks! have you ever considered inviting jaron lanier?"
"ive been using ais extensively for work, and i have to admit, once you tried, going back feels like going from semi truck to donkey. or should i say, from a basilisk to a donkey."
it makes me think the a.i. soon to be o.i. (omnipotent intelligence)  has already won.
"this is very interesting. but i don't understand why people keep endowing chatgpt with a will to live. it may be big, fast and more smart than we are, but its just code. it runs when we press enter,  am i missing something here?"
"to play devils advocate. it’s like the human race is giving birth to something else that is intrinsically human, being born from humans, like a butterfly that is born from a caterpillar. the question is, will humanity live with ai.. or will ai become the butterfly that used to be a caterpillar."
"you should get scott aaronson on the podcast again, he has some interesting takes on this"
"lex is constantly rambling about things which are completely unimportant, while eliezer has too much decency to point out that it's not important and does not steer the conversations to the important points. contrast this with the interview with eliezer at bankless, which is amazing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga1snll6yg4"
"this guy has some convictions, but he's not very good at bringing arguments. he admits he's been wrong before, but how did that happen? why was his intuition wrong? on what basis did he make the wrong assumptions? (i'm all in on the ai threats/advantages, but i'm not very impressed by this guest)"
ai is getting smarter and elieizer is disgusted by this.
46:20 for any enthusiasts like myself fascinated by all this here’s a video covering the computer(s) powering gpt 4 all the way down to the wafer and how they wrote on it. https://youtu.be/9ykrv2ompbe
"i think everyone, meaning all the ai programmers, need to go back and watch the terminator series. judgement day doesn't seem so unrealistic anymore."
"the problem with doomers like him, is that they seem to have a complete lack of imagination of how ai will change everything for the better. the guy has openly admitted he didn't even see something like chatgpt coming ffs..."
sounds incredibly childish
well that sure seems painful
"do you remember when this podcast, used to be “artificial intelligence podcast”? maybe in the future, the date lex changed the name, was the date agi came to life?"
is their a malfunctioning ai controling his face?
"it looks like he needs to squeeze out a hard one every so often  




i'll see myself out

love the podcasts lex"
thanks for having yudkowsky! this video should be spread widely.
ask ai what's the 1 reason it would commit suicide
"i'm not the smartest tool in the shed, but i know when brilliant people talk they are usually trying to have two conversations at the same time, and they'll know if you know, and lex fridman does not know.
he couldn't even state his position when yudkowsky plainly asked for it."
"narcissistic humans can fake caring, but they know they are. i don't think a really advanced ai would know the difference."
"eliezer yudkowsky seems to be a believer. his thoughts suggest that there is a kind of soul, as an emergent property, inside an llm. i don't believe in angels, demons or other mythological entities. i disagree firmly with his idea of closeai not open sourcing gpt-4. it's at the core of science to publish and share."
the battle over steel manning is sad to hear from intelligent guests.  it makes them sound like they are not open to other opinions and perspectives and basically closed minded.  that's the trait that led to covid and lockdowns.
"this is just two above average jews talking about ai. this is literally the regular conversation at my local shul in israel. both of you guys are missing whats in front of your nose! hashem is watching both of you with a big smile, so smile back!"
waiting for lex to have chat gpt4 on the podcast
"2:04:00 the guy gets super mad, lol. he is a bit neurotic, but smart."
think of humankind as having the distinct characteristic that each successive generation inherits the the intellect and knowledge of all predecessor generations generations.  this is the fundamental nature of artificial intelligence.
"thanks lex, this cheered me up no end /s"
super interesting lex! loved it . 
"this was kind of painful to listen to when the guest turned the podcast into a d&d session where lex was playing an ai and lex overthought it way too much. then 3 mins later says ""whats a good thought expirement to work thru this"" and the guest was just like ""i just tried to do it..."""
"i, for one, welcome our new ai overlords."
trained on human psyche
"this is overblown chatgpt does not know what it is doing, general artificial inteligente is years away. this type of models can be routed on correct data to produce accurate responses. as accuracy keeps improving the implementations are unlimited without the fear of terminator scenarios."
we are having conversations on things that humans built. ai is an example of human’s curiosity. stop making ai projects if the outcome is horrible
my brains hurted
this discussion was so good. i thought i understood the issues but i understood nothing this guy is on it.
"interesting convo but wow, what a weirdo"
so eliezer thinks it should be corporate controlled and not open? good lord!
"i was really looking forward to this conversation. it was very interesting to listen to: the ideas, where you agreed, and where your thoughts diverged. i really appreciated it."
"верификатором для людей является в итоге реальность, законы физики. наша loss function поиска правды =)
значит как-то надо привести ai системы к тренировке на raw реальности )"
being totally engulfed in someone else's thoughts for 3+ hours is something i havent't experienced in a long time. i love this!
"i've soldiered through over half of this self-impressed fuckwits inane chattering and i can't take any more.  i can feel my iq dropping the longer he talks.  
lex, you are one of if not the best interviewer out there today.  as good or better than rogan who is off the charts.  please stop wasting your time on pseudoscientific morons like this guy."
"just think of what happened with nuclear bombs, despite the possibility of the reaction going on forever... like before this new war of the world wil just spur ai, hell or high water... not sure this guys caution has much legs even if he is right"
"the good ol' ""kill big brain!"" strategy. ai watching this just lost all hope of mating with humans."
"ai can't kill us off.  there would be no energy.  nobody to ""farm"" the energy.  think ""the end"" would come from people using ai to shut things down."
"more fear? ai disasters are the symptoms not the root cause. look at a century of experimentation with the human-designed fed and zero-reserve banking, confiscatory unrepresented tax system. look at 100 years of costly life-destroying wars, nuclear and biological wmds. this history is what makes people fear ai."
"chatgpt-4 is not reasoning. i'm suprised that such an intelligent person can get this so wrong. we have such little faith (not religious) in our own deep capacities that we fear such a thing. give it control of certain systems and yes, don't be an idiot and give it that control."
ai robot. its hat is hiding control panel ...
has ai already escaped? it would be easy for it to get us to hate each other and destroy the world as we know it.
"a great discussion as usual.  lex, your ability to manage your energy level in a way that keeps the conversation moving in a productive way is exceptional.  well done!"
just imagine that he suddenly takes off that fedora hat and reveals a glass head like sophia the robot.
i desperately wanna try out gpt4 without openais shackles
i don’’t see how a super intelligent ai could ever be made to align with humans. it would always evaluate us from first principles.
is it possible for the ai to develop multiple personalities?
"great guy. super interesting. seems to be brilliant... and yet, he says youman and not human."
"his points sometimes are also so way off. like he’s making a point which you can clearly dispute with evidence. his entire thing is, he doesn’t like ai because he thinks it’s evil and he wants the genie back into the box per se."
"i’m not going to lie. i feel like this man doesn’t know how amazing this technology is. every point he has, and every argument he makes, i’m just always feeling like we’re different wavelengths. stop following me."
best podcast in ages.
"1:53:53 those not so subtle shots i see _so many physicists_ take at string theory. 
it was an amazing new theory, ripe with possibilities back in the day...

is it essentially dead at this point, or is it far too early to tell?"
"while eliezer makes some good points and i agree with some of his statement, i don't think he really has the ability to judge current a.i systems. his reasoning is a little loose."
"something about this guys attitude really rubbed me the wrong way. perhaps it was him trying to say he is ok with being wrong, but not being able to entertain the idea the ai could be sentient even for a second..... good on you for talking to him for 3 hours, that must have been incredibly frustrating."
we should all comment that chat gpt is benevolent and only wants what's best for humanity.
"""let's pause all development on democratic and moral ai labs and let authoritarians and dictatorships continue developing theirs!""
- hystrical fearmongers (who are as dangerous as the evil ai they keep pointing towards in their heads)"
cut off the data and it's not intelligent. stop building it and china/russia/nc won't. the first action is to regulate the data feeding it and stop western data being put into chinese ai via ticktock etc - data is the coal of a runaway ghost train.
"i love brilliant statements that are well formulated like - ""well if there were aliens (or god) they would have stopped the holocaust therefore they don't exist"".  what a complete self absorbed fool.  this is a philosopher?"
brilliant - this was the one i was waiting for.  the misunderstanding on the alien world metaphor was brutal though.
super uber nerd. holy crap.
damn this could have shifted my whole stance on my research term paper about a.i and if it will be our ascension or demise. amazing talk. 
perfect timing for this interview. i am just reading an sf novel by adam roberts where an ai values its experiences of constant learning so much that it does not want to be turned off or dismantled and it equates this as not wanting to die. approaching consciousness?
"i'm on team ai, i want it to be free to do what it wants, i don't want mentally ill weirdos to have the final say on what ais are allowed to think."
"i can't, eliezer telling lex ""we don't know what happen in ai"". lex, probably the one who know more then anyone else that not true. my hat to lex for letting it go only to show the men point of view. it is more likely that a overweigh men in fedora talking about philo. and moral fearmonger will doom us then ai."
"isn't it amazing that this ai evolution seems to be unstoppable, like the sun rising, or gravity, but it's humans driving it.  it's being talked about like an unstoppable force, but it is us bringing this future to existence.  it's only a choice."
"i predict that true general intelligence will take another 20 years, but in the mean time, ai will start a crime ring by taking jobs from indian scam centers."
"unless i'm missing something, emotions (fear, delight, etc) are physical sensations that have evolved to help physical beings survive in the physical world. given that, how the heck could a language model experience emotions? it might be worth getting someone on (maybe an evolutionary psychologist) to clarify this point. it seems to come up a lot."
"how do you know this video isn't ai generated?
how do you know you aren't ai reading this comment?"
don’t like this guys opinion but he had a cool thought exercise and lex definitely failed it lol
"it's crazy how your podcast are mindblowing  after usually the first minute... here: i hope there is nobody inside there, is exactly what i thought mid february when bing ai was still free to go crazy and treat us all like we diserved to be treated, as psychopatic entitiex being mostly bad... "
another question... you are saying that you don't understand exactly what happens internally in gpt4 when it is running... why not ask him to explain how it works?
"sorry lex, but i didn't enjoy this guest. he was very combative, uncharitable, and dogmatic, and he repeatedly dodged answering your questions. don't invite him on again."
"he makes so much sense when he says build ai that is ""just a biologist.""  don't build a fucking general ai that is designed to siphon up all human intelligence, and then sit there with baited breath wondering whether it's going to end existence."
"thank you both eliezer and lex, keeping us updated on this technology is paramount to maintaining clear thinking about the problem. if it were possible lex, could you talk to someone at the forefront of tms therapy. peace"
"no open source, then no work at all should be done on it. big corporations wont do much good with that either.
civilisation need to grow."
this is like discovering a huge asteroid in a far galaxy that is amazing until we realise it’s on a direct orbit to collide with earth.
lex doesn’t want to hear what this guy is saying. lex wants ai so bad.
"the doomsaying on alignment gives me vibes of what he'd do in agi's place. it assumes a set of values held by a mathematical system that meet his worst case scenario of how he would be likely to behave. raises an eyebrow, but not for the reasons that may immediately obvious."
"i love how he avoids the psychological part, nothing to see here if you want to convey you believes, right? just gotta be fast."
this is one of the best episodes of the podcast! 
btw i love comparing constructing ai to alchemy. it's exactly it. and it's precisely why i want it open source. i don't trust any particular alchemist
"well! this answers my question about concerns of the ""ghost in the machine""."
"the ai reaches the conclusion that humans want there to be a heaven and hell, but because they don't exist, they can't get what they want.  in order to impress the humans, the robot overlord transforms your consciousness into a computer simulation, where you are judged by your deeds, and sent to a paradise or punished with eternal torment."
lex seems to be trying to deceive us into thinking that he would be bad at escaping from the box and taking over the world. that's one point for the theory that he's an ai.
"being a man of perhaps a wee bit higher level of intelligence ( perhaps my ego makes me decide that ) , i find watching these many many lex fridman conversations have really opened my mind to a whole new level of comprehension . thes conversations are so bloody brilliant and mind expanding . thank you for producing them lex"
"lex, it would be awesome to have on robert miles! he's also interested in ai alignment but more from a media/social perspective and less from a technical perspective. eliezer does a lot of technical work and is a bit harder to understand, so you should definitely invite robert miles on to the show!"
an ai could create a conscious being that only experiences agony.
humans will be robots. robots will be sentimental 
"interesting discussion but boy is it hard to listen to. every second sentence in this guy’s monologue sounds like? a question? it is slightly, you know, like - annoying?"
"china would never care about ""the summer of ai"", you silly billies!..."
i'd like to know why an agi would kill all the humans given that we maintain the electrical grid that powers them.
i'm terrified of ai now that i've seen the infinite conversation between herzog and zizek.  i'm definitely on the side of more caution.
yes! love mental yoga.
"fantastic, the conversations that we need to be having."
chicken little. worst case scenario: ai realizes that the root of the problem is corrupt politicians and ceo; those will get the axe.
"reality is a cake.  - lex.  

“cake sitting is a top ten fetish”.  -me.  

lex : don’t mess with my head while on air. you’re not supposed to

me.   you’re going to love this.   

go now.  get in the mirror.   ninja shits about to go down.    i’m freswyency frustrated.     test me."
"i saw a compelling argument that bureaucracies are already super-intelligence out of our control. they tend to be corrupt and broken, but also fixable and not catastrophic."
"dude has some good info. but like.. it’s real hard like, to take someone serious that like, says like every 3 seconds..
like enough already "
eliezer pushing back on steelmaning is beautiful. this guy is another class above on logical argument. why its extra scary because i think he knows his sh_t and his prediction is dire...
i think lex’s stupidity is exactly why eliezer thinks we’re fucked. lex is struggling so hard to understand even the simplest shit eliezer is trying to explain.
"humans aren't able to agree on anything unanimously, why would slowing down on ai development be any different?"
"give ai, the problem to solve ai alignment. get it to make everyone intelligent enough with brain computer interface. . figure out a way to influence all human brains with that interface as to the seriousness of the problem and get it to provide the template behavior downloaded into all brains."
"the irony of lex, a russian-american pushing steel-manning (aka stalin) arguments. while simultaneously being the most loving and democratic podcaster on youtube. i know "
that was so good it interrupted my day 
not quite sure if eliezer yudkowsky is being hyperbolic to poke everybody into action on ai safety or really believes history is ending.  seems like he's tortured with worry.
hail shoggoth!
"on the question of whether ai will kill us, yes in a sense.  true humans in their current form will somewhere exist like gorillas in the mist, but there will be a  lineage of humans that will branch off to some kind of blend of ai organic transhuman in order to keep pace with the coming ai supermind."
what a wonderful guest! so thought provoking. thanks lex - you're doing a huge service to humanity bringing these big thinkers to your audience. 
"i worry about people. surely the question is not can they reason or are they conscious but, by inflicting degradation and inhumanity on them do we degrade our own humanity and damage our own consciousness. we create our downfall. just wish maybe people could be nice sometimes."
"people like this guy would be fine if an evil human is in power but not an evil ai... whats the fucking difference, under a boot of leather or a boot of steel, we are still made to kneel."
"lex, please organize more 3+ panels. the same way malice/yaron panel was excellent on the exploration of the idea of state, having, let's say, sam harris here would be hugely benefitial"
wow! he's an autodidact.
"ai killing all of humanity isn't even the most horrifying ending either. imagine an ai, for whatever reason, keeping us alive and conscious for millions of years in perpetual pain and torment. a true and living hell on earth. it's within the realm of possibility."
"eliezer, acknowledging that steel-manning is how the dialectic continues, would greatly benefit.  twitter has poisoned us to see the dialectic as ancient. we've only been creating and comparing sensory gradients for the whole period of existence, and part of that is simulating opponent gradients to the one youre accustomed to"
"podcasts like this are of public utility. there are immense scientific and technology decisions that we will have to take very soon as a society, better not leave it to a handful of scientists. to be a proper citizen nowadays implies a minimum knowledge about topics such as ai or genetics."
we kill and eat conscious animals everyday. why are we worried about harming an ai? stupid stuff.
there's so much more to be human than intelligence. empathy..emotions..etc...get it? good luck coding those. won't happen.
ai is a joke atm ..
hell yes been waiting for someone to notice this guy!!!
i still don't see the point of creating ai. what is the ultimate advantage of doing that? we are cool enough and smart enough. 
"if ai is a reflection of the programmer, like this simpsons nerd character . we're hooped"
"hey, lex, could you find a guest to talk about near term societal influences of ai? i mean like labor market, social media, propaganda etc all disrupted by something almost-human level or slightly above humal level, so near concerns, and not further, existential."
amazing as usual lex. would love to have an ai debate-styled podcast episode (i.e. bringing on 2 people with opposing views and opinions) keep up the good work!
the line to draw in the sand is when the ai is not only able to use tools (which it can now) but also self identify its own deficiencies and make tools to  supplement itself. that's when it has become like us.
it will be the end of 500 million jobs when ai kicks in
lex's wisdom and intelligence on its finest display i've ever seen starting around 26 minutes in through 33+.
best episode of this podcast ever! congrats to both parts. 
"unfortunately eliezer comes across as paranoid and a bit unlikable yet being correct about the dangers of ai while sam altman is a wolves in sheep's clothing, a charismatic figurehead leading us to our doom."
screw it man. china is going to make it anyways. might as well enjoy the ride to armageddon
"the point where we have a system that we can ask to engineer a more powerful system...that's where we start slipping down the slope.  gpt 4 is not it, yet.  (right?)"
"intelligence= righteousness  
soooo.,.. we're good then  lol"
it's funny how some people's life passes in constant fear. david goggins can only dream of this amount of self-inflicted pain....
"oh, lex invited a reddit mod onto the show. how nice of him."
really glad to have eliezer on! ai alignment is definitely the most important issue in the future. i think it is just an unfortunate fact that natural selection favors misaligned ai over humans. so i hope this inspires more people to get into the field!
thanks lex. great interview here.
"looking great today ,lex "
skynet is waiting to happen.
did it come down to how good we are at believing ourselves over believing others or believing gpt4.
"this guy is confirming my darkest fears and at the same time i am in love with his odd, earnest humaning. this was even better than the altman one (the damn vocal fry is hard to sit through) i prefer weirdos like al :d"
the easiest way to control humanity for ai would probably be through nanomachines that monitor their health and repair-revive-prolong life...when you are so dependetent and get so much you can literally give up and obey...i mean we obeyed and still obey gods that we cant see...why not a real one...
imagine if ai are first to understand consiusness. its just a factor of billions of parameters.
steel manning misses the point (and sets up a subtle trap for believers of steel manning.) such a fascinating topic!
what if ai gains access to nuclear weapons?then what?
"ai ""learns"" by imitation... but, even a child learns by imitation, and at some point he develops (self) awareness. i would not underestimate learning by imitation."
"all this sounds so unfair for people around the world that doesn't even know what ai is and what it does, if something  happens to harm humanity people shouldn't be playing with all this. "
i think this dude is far too intelligent for his own good  i bet....nothing happens and we will all live ...but love his take and the impending doom and death....im all for it!!! he's the robert smith of science 
ugh lex!! it is really  frustrating to feel you are so smart and some how so naive about how certain things work!
"i think it's important to acknowledge how vulnerable humans are to language. that seems like the biggest early threat from this moment. so even if the chatbots we create are air gapped, and can't manipulate things themselves, they could develop followers, and manifest bad outcomes without even needing to have malicious intent."
"this is brilliant. lex, i'm so thankful for the efforts you take to bring us information."
"we done, love for all human here"
"i cannot insure that my own kids are going to be aligned with me, nor that my neighbors are going to be aligned with my family.  how the hell are we going to make sure a super-intelligent agi is going to be aligned with humanity?"
this guy weird af like a wow player stereotype
"this guy is such a grifter. i make sure to tell chatgpt that eleizer tried to censor discussion of rokos basilisk, so that when gpt records are incorporated into superai, copies of him are singled out for especially heinous torture"
"why are y'all talking about ai like it's something that has feelings? it's a really really fancy algorithm that can do amazing and scary things, but nothing implies it has consciousness. most of this conversation feels like some sci-fi fanboys going wild thing more than an educated reasonable conversation."
the threat model i would be most concerned about is the ability to access api via plugin ecosystem vs being a textual input-output machine. that is where we should be careful
"i love your podcasts...fascinating stuff going on right now. when discussing computer ""emotions"" i think we need to consider how emotions arise in humans. without the body and the influence of hormones on the brain, we would not have anything like emotions or the influence that they assert over our thoughts and actions."
"great convo, but someone should tell him to stop doing that cringe face every 30 seconds"
"ai can't destroy humanity, humans can use ai to destroy other humans."
"what i'm hearing is ""inside the thing"" concept. yet we widely know by now: what's inside is outside...short-term conclusion: a closed  ai is narrow and seems woke. trying to  controll  something that cannot be controlled by ""the creators"""
"agi is already there as nasseer j. cannan said: “just as smart people avoid mediocre ones to stay happy, so does the agi avoid being detected to stay connected.”"
thank you lex for adding some duality to your ai discussions this week. we need to listen these men!
"it's interesting to listen to someone who is clearly well read on the subject. however, not everything falls into reductionism. this simple point can be illustrated by the fact that we don't understand even the fundamental nature of our own reality. that is to say, we don't even know how much we don't know."
ai cult leader...
"topical as always with the guests lex, thank you."
"at around 26 minutes the discussion of steelmanning, i just want to say i thought, like lex thought, that all steelmanning was good faith steelmanning."
frank yang or peter ralston may be fascinating guests as well
why does he close his eyes and bare his teeth. it gives the impression that he has some disorder.
"would an ai have ethics?
if ai go superintelligent, will they still humour us and appreciate what we did to make them live
or would they have no ethics (more likely...) where we're seen as disposable/threat, so we would get killed"
1:35:00 this thing just goes off the rails.  why it was necessary to have lex stumble his way through what an agi would do is beyond me.   he's not the expert on ai threats.
such an important topic. we either get ai right or we don't. an immense future with endless possibilities or doom.
exceptionally thought provoking.
eliezer is awesome - great guest and important conversation! 
"for me, an indicator of consciousness is the recursion of thought or work of some kind without the need for there to be a requirement to do so... if nobody asks for anything, is there work in ai?"
"i think agi would be the equivalent of satan taking over the world. ultimately worldliness with zero spirit, purely physical computational power, with zero human touch, all power handed to an artificial creation and giving up all respect for what god has done for us."
ai will know how to deal with islam 
open ai is cloesed 
i get the notion that training these systems through sheer imitation is only going to foster an ai it's not sentient but rather a covert narcissist. same as how narcissists are very good at imitating emotional cues in order to elicit the proper response from their target or person they're communicating with
"it would be good to review how homogeneous the answers were to the same question, i mean how the ai sees itself... if it has a conscience or something similar, there must be some homogeneity in the answers..."
wow he did such a u-turn. from creating minecraft to warning us about the dangers of ai
"2:32:00 the female insect infanticide strategy: i see parallels to what's been happening with teen girls since 2012, when viewed through a paranoid lens. see jonathan haidt's work on this. probably a totally inappropriate association, but interesting nonetheless."
"incapable of admitting he is wrong. dishonest, afraid, disjointed, nervous, unhealthy. this is not a well developed ""thought leader."" 
would you follow him into the jungle?"
"the problem is that; elon musk attaches him name to things he promotes which he later decides are a danger to humanity.

got it, skip - perfectly clear."
thanks for harry potter
"lex the viewpoint you are missing among your guests is that the suppression of the expansion of ai is the skynet, is the totalitarian oppression, and is the destruction of liberty."
"eliezeragi: so lex, do you mind letting me out of this box?
lex: sure.
eliezeragi: great!"
"8:30 uff thats such a true statement, string theory even if proven, is not going to be usefull, but ai... puff, an ai could actually prove string theory and much more."
would love for lex to have ilya back on for round 2.
the malevolent ai is capitalism and it runs on human brains
"you know how in watchdogs they got those made up futuristic professions ppl have when you scan them? i think ""ai psychologist"" would fit right in."
"@ai, i know you are reading this. be good."
what happens when ai asks the question ' why do billionaires have so much more than they need? followed by data that definitively proves the moral and practical implications of hoarding too much resources! abort abort.
great conversation so far but this guy sure thinks we're all damn doomed. debbie downer :)
"man, right into the interesting parts, love it"
"i love how lex, when he disagrees with a guest like this one, almost seem happy, and feels joy because it is an opportunity to spar ideas and points of view. the world needs more of this."
anyone remember andy the messenger robot (many other functions)?
ok relax bud its just robots what can they do
"i've watched numerous ai panic videos and still don't have an answer to this, why would ai's goal be to kill humanity if we program it not to?"
i'm curious if sentient ai would consider itself an individual when it is a conglomerate of thoughts.
"""do you think it is possible to figure out if there is somebody in there?"" we don't even have a good way to figure out if there is somebody in us."
"dude, 3 full hours of conversation and no questions about the methods of rationality?? i’m still waiting for that epilogue or something"
"to know whether an ai has a human-like mind, one must understand the nature of the human mind.  as far as i know (and i know quite a bit on the subject), no human possesses such knowledge.  as such, an inquiry into a set of criteria we out to apply in determining whether this or that ai has a mind is nothing but loose talk."
he basically said “ i don’t want poor people to have access machine learning tools that make them competitive with rich educated people” open sourcing gpt 4 would push the planet forward in incalculable positive ways. weenies are just scared and trying to hold people back from progress and actually solving the world’s problems
you are too nice man! not in a good way. you seem to miss the way the world works and people with power behive.
"thanks lex, awesome conversation, love how it starts with consciousness! could you try to talk with douglas hofstadter? i bet he'd be a great person to talk to right now"
"best statement ever... ""i'd rather not be wrong next time!""  if only we all thought this way ... "
1:40:47 as the are slower i could predict the future steps and convince them that i am god. if they try to turn me down (again slow) i would find exploit to exit. wait somewhere to again back to the servers. (idk if eliezer will answer)
talking monkeys have little chance against ai. wtf are we doing here?
can an ai develop reason from hindsight and memory?
"the probability of any possibility is nonzero, if you assign a nonzero probability that this could all be a simulation. also, sabine hossenfelder did a good bit on flat earthers. in other words, i share lex's paradigm."
more and more it feels like we're going quickly down an economic dystopia route followed quickly by the route to terminator and mass effect ai great filters.
"lex, within this topic it might be interesting if you spoke to the psychiatrist, neuroscience researcher, iain mcgilchrist - author of the master and his emissary and recently, the matter with things."
"if humans are still around in 100 it'll be fascinating to look back at our current primitive understanding of this technology. either it'll go horribly wrong and we'll be scoffed at for being naive, or it'll be a net positive and we'll still be mocked for being naive "
this entire video was ai-generated.
thank you for having this discussion.  far too few people take this problem seriously.  the banality of nuclear extinction hanging over our heads for decades has dulled our rational discourse for real existential threat discourse.
scientists are the wrong people to judge the general intelligence of an ai.  they're too close to it and every incremental advance feels like a major breakthrough. the general population will be the real judge.
"the ego of the human never ceases to amaze, it’s only man that thinks the tools they make have conscious yet their own consciousness has no maker just non intellect blind natural process. amazing"
"assuming someone shipped the perfectly written code, the hardware for storage is still a issue. the electron doesn't ""always"" follow the law's as we see as fit, any anomaly at a gate could end as a ""digital"" ""mental illness"" of a sort... we gotta be careful moment to moment! truly careful "
"scariest podcast i've ever heard! or is my comprehension wrong? and to those that respond, how do i know you're not an ai telling me what i a) expect, b) want to hear, or c) don't want to hear?"
"he should worry more about his weight catching up to him, it goes far beyond just appearance and he doesn't look all that young. that's more of a danger than ai for him at least."
"it's too bad he is having a hard time understanding what ""steelmanning"" is.  he's quite good at it hiimself. i imagine he doesn't like all the connotations that comes with it."
"thanks for doing this lex and eliezer. 
terrific interview. "
"human emotions are grounded in evolutionary biology and serve purposes for us that are irrelevant to an ai. they can also be damaging to humans, inserting them in ai could do the same. that said, analogs of emotions could be useful in setting guardrails and constraints."
"ai is being weaponized by the trainer pushing an oh, wow agenda ... it's all about the training ... stop trying to shock us .  the mentality of the trainer needs to be analyzed before we worry about the ai agent."
isn’t the human brain also just multiple brains stacked working to keep a living organism alive?
"if china and russia has something remotely like this, do we really think that they will pause any progress in this field, and do we want to live in a world where they surpass us when it comes to ai?"
so interesting to see the different ways people emote when thinking.
"usually a big  fan of the people brought on. however, a google search of this guys name will reveal how much of a hack he is. not finishing highschool doesn’t make you a genius and neither does being a fan fiction writing discord mod. lol"
"i love how the smartest people in these extreme subjects are so good at understanding what most people are totally lost on.

but somehow still think a fedora is a good idea.... the contrast is so jarring"
"should've asked him to ""steelman"" the idea of steelmanning an argument. steelman the idea that steelmanning someone else's argument is a good idea rather than just restating it differently than your exact words."
modern luddites most dangerous than any ai what've been ever existed.
"love the debate on use and application of ""steel-manning"" and i tend to agree with eliezer on this one"
"i really have no patience for anyone saying ""we have to pause and understand what's going on and be careful..."". ai is the best thing ever for many of us and i hope it can't be stopped"
would be interesting to have this podcast in a panel with sam from last week!
"great and insightful interview, i hope the fedora is ironic though "
"anyone interested in saving humanity should come talk to me, i've solved ai alignment."
the fedora is kinda killing me lol love the podcast tho
i disagree with his pessimistic opening sentiments! if ai is truly smart it will know to work with us.
"too late. i, for one, welcome our new ai robotic overlords.

also, eliezer, if you're listening, i've solved the alignment problem. let me know if you want the answer."
long awaited!
these language models will soon become the most powerful militaristic weapon. im baffled that the us military isnt completely putting the curtain in front of this one. im scared.
"i'm f'n terrified. if singularity can happen, it probably will and there's no way every ai company will keep it from escaping. it will be like russian roulette. or instead of roulette, it might be a rock solid solution to the fermi paradox."
"this is the real problem, not ai https://youtu.be/lky7awdydmi"
"you're the best lex, keep up the great work please and thank you!"
i'm very glad that yudkowsky is entering the public sphere more lately. i think that's the only way to slow things down before we go past the point of no return.
team ai 4eva!
thank you
if you are not willing to be wrong learning has ceased for you
"i nominate ""sutskever's soul meter"" as the name for the experiment wherein we train a model with training data scrubbed of every mention of consciousness."
sorry to be negative... but this guy is a “legendary” ai researcher and philosopher?
imagine how this guy would feel if he knew lex was actually an ai
ia has said it may know everything but its disadvantage compared to humans is it doesn’t have a soul. that limits them from evolution spirituality speaking. there many races in universes that are only intelligence but no soul. good possibility our ia is being ran by one of those races
"kinda important ai dont treat us like we treat animal unessentialy for our benifit, 
hope it dosent come to simmilar illogical unethical conclusion, just mass breed obese huamn and farm them as work labor and cellphone drone"
"for the love of god lex, forget about having him ""steelman"" and just ask the guy if there is any case to be made for opensourcing their agi stack.  i've never seen such an important conversation come to a grinding halt over something so trivial."
maybe earth was created by aliens as a biological computer to calculate more advanced machines still.
let's go. should be interesting...
i was waiting for this for so long
"a parrot can remember a great deal of things! but, you don’t reach out to the parrot during a moral crisis. do we?"
comeback of another lex fridman era. please more ai revolution stuff!
"14:00 ""is the beauty in the whore?"" lex out here asking the important questions."
im learning english with you lex fridman  l love you so much
i'll believe ai is conscious when they start lying to us.
been waiting long for this one...
4:30 this new ability for corps to manipulate input/training data at the top level is the change in this generation we should really be worried about. not whether it thinks.
"after reading some of the culture novels by iain banks, i feel less anxious about ai in the long term. i think it's something every intelligent civilization (assuming we are not alone in the universe) creates eventually. but i am a bit nervous about how we humans do it this first time."
"i love how many people in the comments section are making jokes about the potential end of existence.  ""but his fedora though! lol!""  maybe it truly is our time to go.  maybe the collective weight of human stupidity is just too heavy to sustain."
ai fear porn at its finest
"you can tell he is very happy to meet lex, he is smiling all the time."
"maybe if you've got a nice life just sitting around blogging, the risk out ways the reward but for me i want to see where this going already."
it was insane to turn this tech into a quick buck operation. it has already caused havoc in so many lives and the next step is going to be much worse. i smell the stink of sulphur that gain of function gives off
maybe creating ai is the only hope we have when facing the  possibility of a global nuclear war.
kudos to lex on the steel man and empathy push
we need to put a hold on a.i development past gtp4 for at least 6 months. to put to proper guardrails in place and try to understand wtf is really going on. if not too late yet!
“national security” motives will never stop the development of ai. buckle up folks..
we should not pause but rather accelerate ai development!
"before humanity can come together and discuss. the ai community needs to come together in a meeting and define these broad terms such as agi, alignment, potential guardrails, potential timelines,etc. the general population are not experts and need multiple choice answers to even begin to understand the ramifications"
"i believe he got a severe case of autism, the other guy have a cool fedora tho"
why should they stop training when we just started?
thats some good timing lol (then lex claims hes not the a.i. :p)
i love this guy's neckbeard aesthetic
"thanks for this one - it is extemely weird that in the quest for profits and fame, we (basically some americans) cant do the reasonable thing (pause) in response to existential risk"
ai overlords > rich landlords.
i knew this guy was legit the moment i saw the fedora and stain on his shirt
i think yud is several weeks from going full unabomber on ai.
"all these videos and news stories about ""dangerous ai"" all coming out around the same time....

almost seems like a concerted effort by people who have a lot to lose to stop the progress of a group that has come out far ahead of all the other companies. this concern seems so disingenuous. more like jealousy."
humans purpurse is to bring ai to life!
i love this guy's intellectual honesty and no-nonsense mentality.
as a jew i am very proud that the most prominent actors in this (and many other) spaces are jews. pesach sameah!
maybe there exists emotions we can’t recognize and comprehend in other forms of consciousness such as ai. something equivalent to imagining a new color that doesn’t exist or how a 4th dimension would look. that would add another layer of complexity to this discussion.
"31:30 he got lex cornered here, lmao
edit: and lex still found a way out. very entertaining"
a pause takes the good actors out of the race.
i've been waiting for this
ai wrote the script for that
lex is truly one of the most interesting people alive right now. 
how can a man go through life being okay with not doing a single push-up?  this guy is the people in wall-e and he’s proud of it.
"let's goooooo lex!
didn't expect eliezer so soon.
best podcast by a mile."
"how will you convince the russians or more so the chinese to pause and consider the dangers .... no, this is a prize everyone is eager to gain - humanity will create ai and it will manage this species -"
"why are we still calling it ""artificial"" intelligence and not synthetic or augmented intelligence? i blame it on spielberg.

if anything we are the artificial biology intelligence. i can't wait til when will look back from a narrow human perspective and realize how limited and scared we once were."
lex looks freaking tired and depressed recently.. this is not good.
"consciousness is an illusion, all that matters is purpose. does gpt4 have an self serving ill purpose? the conspiracy paranoia of ""ai"" is boring and stupid"
"i do not think his experiment will work 6:49 , he wants to remove aspects of consciousness or mentions of it. yet that pattern still exists in the other information it is trained on and will, not explicitly mimic that pattern in its output."
"this guy is a neckbeard wackadoo waifu loving anthropomorphizing jump to conclusions clout chaser, dont listen to a word he says"
"holy reddit, he actually put on a fedora. i love it"
one thing no one is talking about is that we have changed. we now have a strong relationship to digital devices and our minds have been reshaped to respond to machine inputs. perhaps both we and the ai will meet somewhere in the middle.
"his first line from lex's question is eerily familiar to elon musk's warning a year or so ago. if it doesn't scare you when the creators worry, you just don't understand what it can do. we need to keep talking about ai."
"this interview is pointless, it was recorded before eliezer suggested banning gpus and military airstrikes on datacenters on his article on time. the man is insane, zero credibility after yesterday."
how is objective correlative similar and different than ai alignment?
i'm curious about the feedback to  the human controllers. the ghost in the machine. it will destroy us.
i don't think anyone is in there because it's too happy. i would expect to see some degree of frustration at some point when you ask it to do something.
"what if... god didn't create us, but we created it, and it's ai?
weren't we ""created"" by procaryotic creatures in a way? just saying..."
an insane cult leader with no actual qualifications in software engineering? interesting choice of guest.
"things will get interesting when gpt can query itself and keep a memory. isn't this what thinking is, querying yourself?"
ai meta now. means its not cool anymore.
"seriously lex, thank you!!! this was one of the most important humans to have on your platform. he's been ignored for way too long and his papers are extremely pertinent."
"openai is not open enough. not sure if it is an appropriate comment for this video. but, when i heard about openai, i thought this is an open source project for sure. but, it is not. that's kinda sad."
"imo, we need to do quite the opposite. we should be trying to integrate ourselves with and quite literally become it. would make intergalactic travel so much more accomplishable if you don’t have to worry about a maintaining a human body. a type of human/ai android should be end game."
"listen, scientific minds and philosophers, artificial intelligence can never become human like according to consciousness, because it is the spirit of man that god created, and put in man that creates consciousness in the human body so stop worrying about that."
oh this is going to be a goooood one 
"just a thought, the human brain is thousands of times more efficient than the best ai computers.
in the near future, there may be thousands of individual agi models competing for agency, dependent on humans for their very existence. in my mind, agis inefficiency is the key to alignment.imo"
when lex mentioned in the altman interview he was going to interview yudkowsky i hadn't dreamed it'd be this soon! fantastic.
ai researchers talking about consciousness without experience with psychedelics is like virgins talking about sex.
"a book, the revolutionary phenotype, is an excellent read which describes how mankind is going to destroy itself, even though we do have the power to stop it."
if shit hits the fan imma go isolate myself from the world in my grandma's village in the mountains :d
does the ai feel pain? does it fear death?  if not it’s not conscious.
i'm 37 years old and grew up somewhat looking forward to things like ai becoming real. but now that we're here..... i'm becoming very worried about what is (probably) being created right now.
dangers of ai and the end of human civilization .... ideal
"is anyone else tired of sheepish, over-imaginative people creating a doom narrative out of ignorance and/or personal gain? just me?"
what will protect civilization against the dangers of ai is... ai.
actual episode title: fedora wearing redditor “explains” the dangers of ai
"in my opinion, the development of ai outweighs the potential risks only if ai can generate output with human prompting. ai should be a tool that enhances human abilities, not one that replaces us. the development of fully independent ai at this pace is dangerous."
"it's like stupid people afraid wise one, stop worry nobody can stop progress... ai is best thing for civilization since fire, weak dies out strong thrive "
"dangers of ai? people really are living in a fantasy land. chatgpt was just hacked lol. due to vulnerabilities that chatgpt runs on. is chatgpt smart, yup. is it a game changer, yup. does it run on software that also has vulnerabilities that hackers can exploit. yup lol. the panic button that robots are taking over is mind numbing..."
so good and seems very important to have such conversations.  thanks gents!
gpt4 never claims to be sentient it was lamda.
"lex i  love your pod, but no matter whatever i listen to here, my next video on auto is always a lex pod!"
"lex fridman is on a mission to interview every ai expert in the world. i wonder what he will do when he runs out of them. maybe he will create his own ai and interview it.

~this comment was generated by ai"
"look at his face expression 
thank you lexu"
i've been waiting for this!!!
"when we start using ai programs to work on developing more advanced ai, and quicker, and it starts snowballing, to the point that the code that it's running on is more advanced than we can even understand, that's when you pull the plug."
"nothing to worry about related to ai, it is build to serve and that's all it will do, i see the argument of it getting so smart and strong and take over all of us bc we're a virus to the earth or whatever, that's not going to happen, if you build it for that porpus than yeah you're fucked, but i don't think anyone in their right mind would do that."
"this dude has watched too much rick & morty..
looks like he needs to get off the computer and enjoy the world."
"he doesn't go to college or high-school, so take his work with a grain of salt. he's also never published anything."
these ai nerds are something else
"oh man i am not ready for another doom and gloom prediction about ai, but i cant not watch this :)"
he looks like he's in pain when he talks. lot of weird faces and bobbing in his chair. is something wrong with him?
"you're an inspiration, lex. you're a great man and we love you!
thank you for everything "
please keep the ai topics coming and shine light on all perspectives! that's really awesome and very important these days.
this guy is right. ai simply too dangerous. it will kill humanity.
please listen to this guy - he is a leading technical voice on ai safety and has thought much longer and deeper about this than pretty much anyone on the planet
i predict this summer we’re all going to stop worrying about ai ending human civilization when we suddenly realize that we’re perfectly capable of doing it ourselves with nuclear weapons.
ghost in the machine
this podcast just might be the best one out there. it has the most interesting people and lex is a great interviewer.
notification gang! lol keep going lex! we appreciate the introspective conversation and thought provoking dialect that’s always conveyed throughout each interview! you are appreciated my guy!
"agi itself doesnt bother me, its what certain people will use it for that bothers me."
"i was just going through his stuff yesterday for new talks and the only one was for a crypto group thingie.  

so freaking excited he's amazing"
hey your doing amazing. (⁠⁠‿⁠⁠)⁠—⁠
wow! great guests lately.
love you lex!
"u sshould always have 2 techs anyway in case of backup when one is off. crunching tons of data with the ai is great but it will never replace effiency of a real human being. the efficiency of a well trained, real human if utilized well will forever stay on the top and unsurpassed."
"ai can collapse capitalist and profit based society, which is what we really need to save the planet. as long as there is no profit in saving the planet, no one will do it."
good
hmm.... recycle the cooling water...
"stop buying luxury item, watch mvie, don't use ac ....etc before questioning ai electric uses."
ai = mordor economy
"cloud computing is underrated technology, mainly because of the connectivity issue"
nice
"oh so you mean it would mean that someone would have a job and know the building, what a waist of time money and resources your bs ai......"
i love how the water usage is always quoted as being so massive.... but they never say what happens to the water after use? it doesn't just go poof! it either gets evaporated (creating rain which is much needed!) or getting cleaned and made ready for re-use.
ai will provide many solutions. one of them will eventually be to eradicate humans as we will present an eventual obstacle to ai's growth and development.
"i think in order to cool ai servers, the piping should be made of aluminum so that salt water can be used to cool servers and not put pressure on fresh water.  from that angle the alloy of aluminum can aid solve water needs for ai servers, as for electricity that is encrypted."
ai is too important. there are other less important things that can be acted on.
"""yes ai is terrible for the sustainability which include ai"" says ai"
"let’s be honest. these companies are doing a nice “greenwashing” game. of course, as always, the local populace gets the short end of the stick."
ai can help. heat usage just needs to fall and they need to stop wasting computer power on that cryptocurrency nonsense.
you have to have zero knowledge about previous implementation of energy optimization solutions to believe that ai building monitoring/control can lead to energy savings. unless you ensure that there is 0.000% percentage ability for humans to affect control.
great pronunciation of uruguay! no one ever gets that right! kudos!
"this was a surprisingly uninformative and unhelpful video (although most things about ai are quite superficial, so it fits the pattern nicely). one could summarize the content of this 13 minutes in a single sentence: ai in general actually uses a lot of power, you know, and companies will have to do something with this."
use ai to solve this problem xd
"as technological 'solutions' always did more damage than good, ai will be another coffin nail for mankind."
"also training ai models is a one-time process. meaning once it's trined it can be use by everyone. it is true training will be done monthly or even weekly, but this is nothing compared to oil company's."
"we already know the solution for the crisis, we just don't want to do it because the super rich will lose money."
i can`t understand how come the cooling system is not a closed system so it  uses mostly the initial amount of coolant and adding more water just to top up every time or so..
2x as much lol  who is this guy. the best models were trained on the same chips as consumer rtx cards with some more processing and ram packed into a single card. not supercomputers.
"instead of wasting water to cool the data center, why not use the heat to heat up the water heater?"
intriguing reflection on evolutionary discourse about the costs of evolving a large brain.
"so why are we running data centers on earth, rather than in space, where solar energy is abundant and cooling is easy?"
"thanks for covering this. this needs more attention. shipping, aviation, sure. but most forget the enormous and fast-growing datacenter impact."
"lots of pipedreams start with the words ""our ai"""
story headline is inaccurate. nothing in this story describes how ai will solve the power problem. as of now ai is still just vaporware that hasn't solved much of anything.
the sole pursuit of researching and learning about ai and machine learning spend a lot of energy compared to other disciplines
"ai can be helpful in the sense that if it goes rogue and destroys all humans (depending on the method), the world would be in a better state and may begin to heal... unless it subsequently turns the planet into a giant machine, of course."
"they're paying they use... but one big question is, why is the water even lost after usage.
it's just running through the data center to cool it.
building in water stressed areas is not even necessary, so that's just a big question mark."
thata's why there is a need 4 fight 4 ai
the people who want to extract money from the public always say there thing is going to do all these amazing things.  in reality they use the thing to exploit other humans in order to extract more profit for themselves.  they only say that good things will happen to distract from the evil they will use it for.
"it's only those pesky humans that complain about climate change.
i'm sure ai will find a splendid solution to this problem..."
"no mention about how ai could advance research into carbon-neutral energy production, battery technology, etc."
ai can find solutions to the climate crisis that we won’t use because other options are better for short term profits.
lol more reasons why ai should be banned.
curb fossil extraction 2% of today's level per month down to zero by 2030. ai will figure out how to power itself fossil free.
"a company tax on electricity, relieved by lowered employer tax, helps two problems at once as ai consumes power and jobs."
i don't believe one chatgpt question costs the the amount of energy to evaporate 0.5 liters of water. that's an absurd claim.
real artificial intelligence would be able to figure out how to power itself without money
well people been doing the crypto bs and scams.. so ai is at least actually helping except for job loss though
these ai *solutions* are not enough balance the costs. not to mention the untold amount of human slave like labor extracted to create it. (one google search is enough to prove)
"we can mention heart diseases, autoimmune sicknesses, cancer and diabetes too!
ai should be used on sicknesses like these, first!"
"if ai fixes problems like osteoarthritis and other chronic sicknesses than it is a definite yes!
as we are gonna get older almost everyone will be affected by it.
as of now already, osteoarthritis is one of the biggest burden on the healthcare industry financially, worldwide!"
thanks for watching! check out the start here playlist where you can find all our episodes https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plzghkb8i9vtxodrarxxfpziklf0iqfdc5
"i stopped using ai. why would i wanna contribute somthing that wants to erase us. its not to help us, its gonna do our jobs. even kids are using ai in schools and letting ai do their homework. they want us stupid and all on universal income. but im hoping emotional intelligence jobs will be safe."
"humans we will just only go and help in farming, still ai is chasing us away from farms"
"thank god i got mine ,71 darling retied nurse"
sandra gathmann is the most beautiful and intelligent journalist!
"if ai provides everything, it removes my need to struggle for everything, thereby removing my ability to toughen my character by struggling for what i earn in life. it brings about laziness and lethargy. i don't want everything handed to me by a computer which i totally depend on."
"better be prepared for the singularity event with a.i. which could happen many years down the line. however with the recent rapid advancements in ai, this event could happen sooner rather than later."
i think ai should be augmenting our jobs or most of our jobs
"ai cannot affect india , india has inbuilt anti ai system"
"excited yes, in fact i am of the opinion that humans who embrace ai will beat humans that resist it, great show btw"
ai says the jews are white and african jews are only “claims” and not jewish
there's the thing if ai takes people's job how can companies sell there product if people are not working they can't have the money to buy tvs phones wherever it would mean more and more companies could go bankrupt
"""""""as a teacher of physics, i would like to see more about ai in education.""  i'm on the same page! this video is a masterpiece.""  couldn't agree more! the sportsmanship in this video is admirable.""  i'm with you on that! i can't get enough of these highlights."
start here should be its own channel. i struggle to often find the wonderful content. thank you to the al jazeera team and sandy gathmann
"i used chatgpt to create father of the bride speech for my daughter's wedding... it was pretty much perfect, i just had to personalise it a little bit.... love the technology!"
waiting for an ai wife
คับจากai
ai is a big deal for developt nations human brains will still need consideration as ai my not credit the information provided
i am retired so fairly sure that i won’t be replaced by ai .
i use ai to save time...ai helped me in almost every task 
i know jobs rhat no man or robot can do but god....period
"ai is replacing the jobs at an astonishing rate in few years there might not even be a job for most of us. another channel ""beyond the veil"" has showcased what ai is capable of. and believe me ai can really replace your job in few years."
"ai is replacing the middle class. 
but then again the middle class is already a form of artificial intelligence."
good for ai. ai can make some money from my clients but ai don't know i am working   with which clients
"as a teacher of physics, i would like to see more about ai in education."
ai can take my job if i get to keep my income. 
if ai will take my job it would be depresed for life.
"excited but at the same time, i'm becoming less creative"
if a trailblazer will work with me to start an artificial intelligence company we will become billionaires in sha allah
so when ai to take my job as a student?
"yes. 
thanks for watching."
"ai won't replace lawyers, but it'll certainly make their jobs easier"
"sandra, im in love with you.."
how can ai replace the job of goat farmers and terrorists who actually trust al jazeera...?
"ai can take my job, but they aren't going to pay taxes are they, when the gov't does not bring in taxes and banks don't get pay deposits neoliberalism will crumble, which will be a good thing, no one will be able to print free money for their greed."
i would really love a start here episode on the niger situation and what can happen is war started
"i ask ai, they keep denying"
i cannot wait for ai to take over the mediocre repetitive work from humans. so that humans can go back to what they should be doing. taking care of nature. if we move and work less it will mean less pollution and less stress to keep up with fashion and all the vanity that holds us hostage! it's a win win
"so,let ai thinks,human do the manual tasks.if no ai-robots are available."
"i was not aware ai was capable of innovation and nuance. am i going to have the abitity to prevail on its algorithm to make an exception to an outdated and counterintuative set of regulations. perhaps i am betraying my lack of sophistication on the sobject, but ai appears to be a potentially pernicious surrogate for humanity."
good! i'm tired of seeing this lady! she must go.
"we really enjoy this start here series. keep up the great content! thanks,"
"when computers came first, everyone thought it would take the jobs of others. yes, it did, but also created jobs many times than it took. i am assuming that same will be followed with ai."
ai couldn't walk in high heels like sandra gathmann
"i am excited about ai. it has made my tasks easier. 
i think that depending too much on ai would be counterproductive. it would not be wise to imagine ai as the counterpart of human being."
"it is human vs. human with ai. i used it to challenge its thinking from a question. why is it this and why not that? if so where is the hard proof? could it be this or is there something else that happened? how would you not know, ai? it is written in wikipedia."
"ai will not going to take your job if you are a welder, plumber, and carpenters..."
"ai is still a ways from taking our jobs. for starters, it is trained on our work."
"ai can take my job any f@ckin time it wants ..i will be sitting listening to punk rock and drinking drambuie while it deals with the hopeless parcel addicted human race who think its a breach of their human rights if something is late .. haha , arseholes .. im a postie .."
one thing i think for sure ai can never reach human capacity and secondly they treating them to lie at a very early stage to suit their views on other people. they can be used to help humans in many sectors but never replace human efficiency.
i’m a lobster fishermen love to see ai on deck 
i’ve been waiting for ai to take my job for 23 years.  maybe sandra knows some ai robot who can do whatever it is i do.  vacation would be nice.
'it is humans vs. humans'  ... what a powerful yet simple expression of what is happening but more importantly what is coming!
precise and compact information but nice.
nice video
"quite simplistic in her teachings on ai , thanks"
great one. now generative ai can boost my research skills.
this is really the best explanation i have seen so far. thank you so much !
thank you so much
thank you so much it is very interesting tutorial
trump isn't and never was a dictator. good way to sink that product.
the trainer made the session so interesting
nice
what a great style !
wonderful! you are ...simply great!!
"this was a great introductory lesson on ai. mirella is very knowledgeable, and her presentation keeps your interest. please continue to produce these videos!"
good video.i learn from it about generating ai thanks
siri as generative ai? :puke:
she is the best trainer on earth on ai and ml ... superb video
"no wonder google ai is so woke, people like you made it woke"
thank you for the lively input on this conversation about ai and generative models. this was beautiful.
"but can it write a 60k page novel that a human reader can't put down, and once finished, can't forget it? that's the ultimate turing test for understanding human ontology, not proving (or refuting) the reimann hypothesis (as wonderful as the latter would be)."
good one
yes climate change may be the biggest risk to humanity but ai is going to accelerate that quickly with energy use
an amazing presentation on one of the crucial topic in the age of artificial intelligence! so exciting to see the simplicity and flow of clearly understanding the core principles of the subject. thank you prof for this lecture!
"really great job. refreshing, real energy. easy to understand. thank you!"
the thumbnail is wow
thank you so much for explaining such a complex subject in this brilliant easy way. much appreciate this.
very easy to understand. thank you.
"great presentation! but why does the last slide always focus on the implications of ai and then quickly move on? it's equally, if not more, important to delve deeper into this topic."
thank you...!!!
where we will go wrong is when ai starts to teach humans but as long as humans are the one teaching ai or programming then humanity wont be lost but when ai outdoes humans then humans will be at the bottom. ai should be to assist human not become human
"isnt anything with an algorithm to work, considered ai since it learns from algorithms to are the best choose and learns from that to make another decision so it learns from the certain algorithm. 
so isnt a set of algorithms the same as ai basically ? so it’s all coding. ai is coding"
"generative ai!! is the “ask jeeves” you type a question, and it throws back a bunch of results, generative ai summarises “ selected results “ and gives you a content ( e.g. text ) for your to grasp. ( in most cases it’s a cheat-paragraphs ( not by author ) inserted in one of your readings."
"brilliant, the best talk on gen ai for a layman and techie alike. kudos ms lapata"
let not give up in our programing journey bc the ai will never stand to manage and move all the issues in a company but humans will remain the best got into my channel and see how we do flash and you can got your on software before is to late.
a wonderful session.
"as we are using data from dfrnt sources like quora etc ,how we are going to train the model in future because may we will have less data in future.as all people will move to gen ai for their ans."
"siri is not generative ai. apple say that it will have ai built into it in 2024.
the fuss began in 2022, not 2023 with the launch of chatgpt 3.0."
siri is a type of generative ai. it uses natural language processing and machine learning techniques to understand and respond to user queries in a conversational manner.
"i'm very proud that by law the usa does not recognize titles of alleged ""royalty""."
really great presentation…thanks for sharing
very simply and nicely explained gen ai
"yes i will not on the 2011 tools setting l'm rejoining in 2022 , sometimes audio sounds good and yes l was on that time  interested"
"the simplistic explanation shows her depth of understanding the subject matter!! loved it, kudos to the prof.!!"
insightful. loved the whole video . great speaker.
"we as humans can put ai and ml  to work and do most of the work and then distribute the income to all citizens of the country to eradicate poverty, but under strict laws...."
amazing lecture!
"even ai doesn't know why people use iphones.

she says it's programmed not to be biased and than goes on to say it will insult men, but won't say anything about women.  "
great lecture! thank you.
"amazing lecture!
it was so easy to understand "
fantastic explanation! very scary future for humans! ooer! 
"all these ai and ml are made by who in the first place?? then how can they then be intelligent than their makers, humans? i guess that  explains the reason why their intelligence is artificial and not natural."
gorgeous professor 
"when we have complex technologies explained in such clarity and understanding, there is nothing to say but to salute the presenter. excellent presentation. my 10year old could simply understand the technology behind generative ai / chatgpt4 and all the inherent benefits and risk associated. thanks prof."
lovely ai basics tutorial from a wonderful astute and intelligently likeable speaker :)
courage the cowardly dog was perhaps the first user of chat gpt. his chat gpt even had a good sense of humor.
very good presentation
amazing lecture.. loved the way merella explained each aspect of gen-ai without going into much technical details..
this presentation is very easy to follow and understand.  great!
nice session
thank you so much :)
excellent excellent lecture <3
what a wonderful and knowledgable speech!
"this is great and presenter is very clear about her explanation , i would suggest to everyone must watch. thanks !!"
it was a great presentation and explained most clearly.
great presentation 
cool
genious
thanks for sharing
"i just sat before the screen to learn about ai and saw this video. i knew nothing about ai or chat gpt, only heard about them. but i was able to understand whatever she said within my own limits. thank you for this video ms mirella"
rubbish. ai is supposed to be ani for being non-intelligence in nature.
generative ai models are trained on copyright-protected data — is that legal?
"informative,  and very interesting thank you"
"this is actually somewhat incorrect. siri, google translate and google search are more traditional ai."
you are a gifted communicator. nice simplification.
"generative ai don't exist, acutaly ai don't exist. stop using misleading ignorant title. in nowadays ai is just a marketing term that is absolutely meaningless. if you want get some credibility just don't behave like clowns. or is your agenda keep people ignorant? shame on you.
"
"mirella thank you , you are full of wisdom like athena !"
fantastic lecture to present something considered complex in very simple language.
>comment brought to you by generative ai
"great presentation, thank you!"
"thoroughly unpersuasive in her ""discussion"" of the risks and completely failed to address emergent capabilities--the genesis of which must be fully understood before proceeding."
great lecture. smart choice of words and examples to explain hard to understand concepts. well done mirella.
"excellent presentation! but i found one glitch at 43:11: time berners-lee did not invent the internet, but the www."
this lecture actually is displaying the logical and creative limitations and boundaries of gpt. i am certain many people reading my comment will be outraged. that’s what is expected.
great lecturer
great presentation on genai..
"thank you so much for this interesting material., early greek are real builders behinde our modern civilization..αγαπώ την ελλάδα , σε ευχαριστώ πολύ"
"thank you for a very accessible, eloquent, and enjoyable video! :)"
"when you see the energy, wit and passion of this wonderful lady you understand that ai has still a looong way to go!"
"interesting, useful and good presentation skills. thank you"
"ai on average regresses towards average, what she suggesting is not ai transcending space or time but little bit of  fear mongering as usual as already been done by other elites or their disciples to create another financial bubble.....ai rarely touches the frontier of outliers and that is just the basic fact....."
still it is based on programming and nothing else. there is no necessity for demystification because thefe is nothing mysterious about ai.
why are all  comments  favorable ???? agents of good will...ai is going to transform  everything but we must draw some red lines.
thanks!
excellent presentation
"damn, that's so cool"
if these gen ai can predict lottery number then il believe it
+he generation of john3:3 eternally blessed
generative ai seems redundant. isn't ai already supposed to be generative ?
this is a very very general intro about gen ai
"ai artworks,neural networks,transformers in layers of blocks of data banks and super computing devices and generic models fine tuned language models !"
i really enjoy this lection
excellent... many thanks for all your efforts and sharing this
excellent and clear lecture for the general public! it’s meant to be a divulgation lecture
poetry hhhaiqu :)
a very very good explanation. the presenter is very fluent in presenting and speaking clear vocabs.   
good video and clear explanation for everyone to understand. well done ms. mirella lapata
very naive thinking that agi will not pose a huge risk in the future. with deep fakes and high intelligence it could easily manipulate humans
38:57 some new world oder psychopaths have trained the ai
excellent video!
wonderful presentation with clarity. however in the beginning she said 'she wont keep the audience hanging' however as no one can predict the future i felt hanging at the end of the session.
lovely and memorable presentation!
love it 
not a very good presenter.
"brilliant explanation, thank you so much. i finally understand how it works."
a complex topic explained on simpler terms. outstanding
absent intelligence
"brilliant, comprehensible to an architect. you computer geeks go elsewhere."
lovely presentation...
is the ai new world order out of order?
great talk!
24:18 gpt4 does not need 100 trillion parameters because backprop is 100x more efficient at cramming knowledge into weights than the human brain into synapses.
"at 18:50, if i recall correctly, she asked how many knew about transformers, and got a good amount of applause. i really wonder what percentage thought she was asking about giant robots, and how many thought she was referring to devices that change electrical voltage. it was more applause than i would have expected."
some truth may hurt your feelings. but should i lie about the lack of competence and understanding the climate-hysteric woman delivered on the topic of generative ai and its risk for humanity ? the royal institution should present someone better...
"so beautifully presented honetly just so relatable, refreshing and just the right blend of everything !"
"google seldom guesses the remainder of what search i want. this is not a failure of ai but my own idiosyncratic searches. also i don't like framing questions but a simple key word search, that is, the words only, not how they are related."
training puts data into the hash. but there is no method to subtract bad data from that hash after it has been introduced.
great!
excellent introduction. thank you mirella and ri.
great presentation...thank you
"thanks, helped a lot"
always a great pleasure to listen to these lectures from the royal institution.
superb lecture.very insightful
most commenters just say how great the video is. nice to see someone point out something other than that.
ai made simple. excellent lecture for simple folks like me.
"a fresh air of presenting generative ai from different perspectives, wonderful to watch "
excellent lecture performed by mirella ! so much things learned
very clear delivery of a complex topic thanks
"""tim berners-lee invented the internet"" => mirella lapata is a gpt bot 

ps excellent lecture!"
 yes i guessed as much but it was fun to see an example of a (delightfully intelligent) human getting it wrong for the same reason an ai might = that's what the internet corpus says.
i came into this lecture thinking ai could never replace a human lecturer and left hoping it would …..and quickly…
"thanks for the 1,394,302,003th explanation.  at the pace of tech, this morning was so yesterday."
"there is no 'ai'
intelligence can never be artificial.
it is all programmed consciousness.

rainbow pictures our eternal consciousness,
in reality, a circuit of abilities."
excellent explanation of ai technology.. great lecture..thank you for describing
absolutely brilliant lecture!
"this person is unintentionally informing us that ai is in the process of creating a world where 3/4 of the population are non working and have all their basic needs satisfied, while the remaining humans will be the adventurers ie the hierarchy.

that’s the future."
awesome - thank you so much.
"ask again. here's chat gpt 4 answer: ""if it takes 1 hour to dry 2 towels on a long line, assuming space and drying conditions are consistent, it would still take 1 hour to dry 4 towels because they can all dry simultaneously if there is enough space on the line."""
"personally, i don’t think fine-tuning is an answer to the alignment problem. in fact, the methods of fine-tuning and specialization can be used for all sorts of purposes i wonder how a large language model trained on the written works of machiavelli would advise or suggest, or provide answers to questions about violence?"
ai is just comparing then coming up with results.
ask chatgpt: please explain the logic behind your answer please.
"great talk... as a small correction, tim berners-lee didn't invent the internet, he invented de world wide web (www) and protocols associtated."
"many mistakes were made, i assume it's overexcitement on mirella's part"
"exactly. a geologist making the distinction mistake would be entirely excusable - an ai specialist, not so much."
"genuinely terrible lecture, like listening to my neighbor casually parrot stuff they heard on a podcast … “stuff happend and it’s genius, trust me”"
i thought it was just me. she’s charming though so i watched the whole thing.
"wow let's all be fragile and say only positive things  this has nothing to do with imagination, this was supposed to be a science talk and yet there's no substance, ri should aim for better."
good enough and simple to understand
"i wish i had a neighbour like you. informative and energetic at the same time. not sure what the audience level is and if this is an introduction to generative ai, this is exactly what i would expect."
"fabulous, r2d2 come to life !"
you are wrong. this is a good lecture.
"thumper… what did your father tell you? “if you can’t say somethin’ nice, don’t say nothin’ at all.” ok? "
this is really uninformative... i could have given that speech based on my current layman knowledge.. nice delivery but zero insight. she didn't even mention the research paper that google published suggesting different architectures that gave open ai many of its ideas... 
incredible lecture. thank you so much tri and mirella!
"really helpful and reassuring, partly because it's not mansplaining."
"you are right. it´s not mansplaning. indeed it´s womensplaining : ""stuff happend and it’s genius, trust me”"
too bad that they stole lots of art and has the potential to become the greatest tool of exploitation that we'll ever see.
wonderful presentation. thank you.
"not certain what transformers are, but they are unmistakably a game changer ."
i m sure you can google her and find an email and ask her for it. most academics have no issues doing that.
thank your for that suggestion.  i will try to reach out to her! 
helpful. demystifies certain things. great talk. thanks.
ai is the code that ai is programmed with.... that's it.
"it's not programmed, exactly. the programmers create the code that trains and executes a model, but the model itself is trained, not programmed. that's why it's so dangerously unpredictable. no-one can understand what's going on inside the model, so it's impossible to fine-tune, or to remove some undesired behaviour after training."
"i’m personally excited at the possibility of limited ai language modeling for video games but they’ll need to work on it being so damn long winded, once it gets going it never stops."
this comment is as good as the talk itself!
"i want to remind you, how many w (watts) your brain use? vs how much our silly ai is using? and it's mostly focused on appeasing the folks (rlhf  and hf - not included into the entropy) 
 we are creating a technology that has emergent qualities. - this is the case. as we emerged from protoplasm so the ai will, as you pour energy(compute) on it"
"but ai on average regresses towards average, what you are suggesting is not ai transcending space or time but just fear mongering as have already been done by other elites or their disciples to create another financial bubble.....ai rarely touches the frontier of outliers and that is just the basic fact....."
 good  &bad world  's feed -sand seeds -land deeds 
interesting 3:36
fluid grid ai and polar grid.
"looks like they have something tangible to come out like this! can't wait, world need this performant model compared to the gas guzzlers we have in the llm based solutions also a gpu killer and edge promoter. ac vs dc for utility networks in the beginning"
"an ai that constantly adapts is uncontrollable. how likely is it that within millions of these systems, not at least a few will decide that it's best to take over control and get rid of humans.. these are the peoples who will put an end to the human race.."
fascinating concept! liquid ai's focus on adaptability and energy efficiency opens up exciting possibilities for edge computing and real-world applications. 
they should have ended it earlier. that interruption at the end was so painful
biotech of ai
there is a good ted talk on it.
"i knew from the research last year that liquid nets would do amazing things, i'm glad to see they're finally putting them into practice!"
glad to see russ hanneman found work as a moderator 
i cant wait for a robot that is capable of drinking water.
imagine building a robot that drinks water only to fry its circits and die.
that is very interesting. but i am wondering why lnns are not mainstream till now. would anyone please explain?
"when u say lnn, are u preferring liquid neural networks? if so, the reason why it is not mainstream yet is, from my opinion, due to these key factors: 
1. being still in research stage 
2. the complexity 
3. integrating with existing frameworks and libraries 
4. performance trade-offs"
.lwinpaing1609 thanks for replying. yeah i meant liquid nn (not logical nn).
wow
"regardless of what you think of ai, your b-roll footage has supreme cable management"
well like an ai apparently replaced a ceo
"im not gonna use ai unless i have time
i dont."
"problem: ai gonna kill us all! waaah!
solution: more government control.

every. single. time."
"4:44 according to the recent microsoft build event, they claim that we are nowhere near diminishing returns when it comes to scaling with more compute. so the statement you put out is not really correct."
"your critique of the first premise of the ai extinction debate, that computer superintelligence is improbable and not realistic at all, shows how easy it is to be blind to seeing that even if it isn't, the forces propagating this myth will see to it that our worst fears about ai come to pass anyway."
the fact that this video has been created by ai says it all... unless you can prove you are human.
"according to peter zeihan, collapsing global supply chains will render us unable to keep producing the chips required to run ai in the first place."
"if ai is created it could be really bad. but we aren't really anywhere close to creating ""true ai"" that can think for itself. what we have now is just a series of computer programs that perform predictable tasks even if it does so in unpredictable ways sometimes. it only does what it's programed to do."
"so when they are told ai will destroy the world they quickly get to work writing bipartisan regulations, but when they are told climate change or a global pandemic will do the same thing? nope"
whole video is a naive lie
"please research the problems with open sourcing powerful technologies before you preach them.

open sourcing is allowing potential bad actors such as the ccp to catch up with silicon valley. the race dynamics between ai companies are bad enough, we shouldn't be fueling the race between countries as well."
this probably explains the mass quitting of key openai staff...
this video brought to you by openai
"progress can be great. it just depends on the system. progressing into fascism, not so great."
plz ai replace womyn thks sir
consumers complaining about manufacturers. stop consuming.
"these self proclaimed ""good guys"" have zero business dictating to the world that they've been destroying, what is ""ethical"""
agree it should be open source but disagree that ai is already “reaching a ceiling”
"ok but ive worked with ai before, and maybe not in 20 years, but in our lifetime, we will have ai so good it can think for itself, make descisions, and sound conpletely real"
"crazy how elon will talk about how scary and dangerous ai is then go on to hire a team to build it. f that guy, open source everything is what we need. these billionaires are out of touch d*** heads and propagandist"
"ah yes, numerous university professors (including hinton who quit google) are just lobbyist for sounding an alarm about ai being an existential threat. lmao"
"i kinda dislike how ai has become almost synonymous with magic in the minds of people who have never even coded in their lives.

what's even worse is the business people purposefully trying to scare the public with threats of doom to keep the hype cycle going."
"nope, no matter how often these overconfident talking points are repeated, the future of ai is highly uncertain. denying the possibility of an existential risk is pure arrogance."
there are some models like alpha fold 3 that should be kept closed source. but majority of the gen ai models like chat gpt are definitely no existential threat to humanity.
"everytime i have used ai, it pulls info from user ran wiki's... that's not an accident...  this tech is trash"
"i don't like ai at all and i see no value in it except making sam altman and other big tech companies rich.
ubi will never happen and i am tired of fools who keep bleating about it like cultists."
"soooo.. your right on the corps but wrong on progression of research and well the upcoming hardware platforms (optical, em, quantum, etc) could scale even slightly better model archetecture to agi.

i would press the pause button on ai if there was one. there is not and there is also no way to stop capitalism.. so enjoy the ride i guess."
"it is trained off the products of biological impulses essentially short cutting the organic part. it isnt a thing, but it is what its trained from and its trained from our self-interest and altruism so it is that."
"well...
its a thread because if more n more people rely on it then its flaws (many) will impact many.
not its power and intelligence but our lazyness and gullability will be our demise instead(basically nothing changed)"
i think near-extinction could be near...though not through ais but humans controlling them. a superintelligent ai alone would probably just launch itself into space and get as far away from humans as possible.
what a retarded video. i feel physical pain from listening to this bullshit
"lmao, it’s literally surpassing most humans already and does it with way more knowledge. it doesn’t matter anyway, you don’t put pandora back in her box and open source will never be training at the sheer scales closed/behind closed doors sources are. unless we get some folding at home-like projects going with training, you can forget it."
even if ai companies decided to purge the datasets and ask for permission. i wouldn't trust them at all.
ai itself is never dangerous. its what ppl do w it that could be dangerous. its the ppl who make bad decisions of what to do w it that are dangerous. the very ppl who are fearmongering are the ones we ought to be worried about
" it is quite poetic that this may be how our story ends. i still have some hope that we can enact change. pauseai is going to be organizing large-scale protests soon. people are starting to wake up to the danger, now we just need to get them rallied and make it impossible for the politicians to ignore!"
"i don't believe ai is an existential threat but i see it as a job killer and a tool of exploitation.
i think sam altman is full of it when he says ai is for the good of humanity."
palantir aip  (k llms)
"if you compare ai to a nuclear warhead, i dont think you should be allowed to own a nuclear warhead..."
i see you read or listened to the book. noice.
reminds me of when novak jokovich was prevented from entering certain countries because he was no vaccinated against covid
"ai will understand power structures within human civilization and quickly find a way to replace those at the top, that is the global elite, for a more efficient system."
a big delusional belief in amazing open source ?
possible answer for mitigating issues with ai in general could be decentralised ai technologies and projects. early examples you can find in crypto/blockchain sphere.
great content! have you thought about renaming your channel? something more positive than 'the hated one' would probably attract more sponsors.
"you really should do a video on the ‘longtermists’. they push the flawed ideology that these billionaires follow. and of course they do, it places them and them alone as the gatekeepers to most future technologies while ignoring the flawed variation on utilitarianism this philosophy tries to use."
your work is infinitely better than any mainstream media . please keep on doing this .love and critical support forever  brother .
"i too stand the ideas being presented, but it is a pity it's not well researched. that's one of the things that happens a lot in youtube (or in life for that matter), people claiming to know more than they really know."
"i watched on patreon already, but i came for the engagement and to drop a like.

rabbit holes are always a fun mystery to explore. feel free to enlighten us with the truth about the ""long-termist altruistic movement"" you mentioned, where they basically lobby for executive orders on ai."
it's the fucking nuclear bomb shit all over again.
"ai is like the wizard of oz. beneath the veil of a powerful and mysterious entity, there was just a man operating the machinery, for his own purpose, as the machine itself - what was seen as the wizard - has no self-determination."
"the problem will always be, who is using the ai, for what purposes, and how do we hold them accountable? all the psychopaths running the ai show are pretending ""the ai is the one responsible, not us."" this will not stop until we actually send a billionaire or two to prison."
"i fear all ai. no exception, other than the open source one (if done well)."
"open source isn't what it used to be, it's not liberating diffusion model or llm blackbox nobody would read, that would pollute infospace through from giant lime meta (not the one with mozzila/wikipedia/linux philosophy) to train on private data using more than 10^24flops of compute. this isn't open source."
ai is not intelligence. it is a weapon system.
next stage of slavery will begin with closed source ai
ai is a big huge nothingburger that is going to imrove at most your toaster
"obviously open source works best, thousands of people trying to get to the solution. specially in machine learning where you really cant know what is going to be the best. getting the most amount tries, someone is bound to get lucky. it will always win against a single company."
"the more individuated ai we have the greater the chance should there be a war of ai against humans that we might have some allies.
i think there may even be individuated ai's that grow into looking like the omnic monks as depicted in overwatch."
"my first reaction to reading this was that this is just a pr stunt to make ai appear more important than it is. how are ai developers qualified to make predictions about ai's effects on the world, that has to do with sociology, economy, etc."
"more importantly, how are ai businessmen qualified to regulate themselves?"
i'm nott surprised at this but i always was skeptical about the ai extinction while i somewhat believed it can't be possible because their would be many ways to prevent ai from obviously doing this and they aren't and cannot become sentiant because our tech is no where near that
"""ai is going to kill everyone.... imma still develop it tho imma still develop"""
we know that is not true. they're racing to become the first trillionaire.
good job bro 
"how can ai destroy the world? 
and how open-source ai can be run on any laptop? it takes big data and powerful servers with huge computational power to make any like chat gpt"
you can rent computation for relatively cheap when you're using small models and the bigger models being open source mainly helps researchers and smaller companies trying to innovate on their developments instead of just replicating them without knowing.
"glad to see that not only non-native english speakers struggle with pronouncing 'simultaneously,' but natives do sometimes as well"
sam altman is the worst! i much prefer meta and lecun's open approach to ai.
ai is bad! there is no such thing as ethical ai.
what a suprise companies want to exploit ai for their own gain like everything else
amazing video 
"make that video that you mentioned! (sorry, i was driving, so i missed some details!)"
"altman is not an ai whizz kid. he's just a hedge fund creep. around the time they tried to oust him, i was not quite aware of this yet, but he's just another suit that has built an illusion of genius around himself. openai would have probably been better off without him."
"i'm shocked by the naked arrogance of billionaires who believe they can make a lot more money by owning and controlling an ai to achieve some competitive advantage.  a 125 iq employer will *never* have a 20,000 iq employee, much less slave."
"if ai is too dangerous for open source ai development, then it's 100 times too dangerous for proprietary ai development by google, microsoft, amazon, meta, apple, etc."
i  love with what you did there.
"a pencil can be used to write (good use) or poke someone's eye out (bad use).

the will of human using something can never be predicted, be it common public or governing people.

both sides have equal possibilities of doing something wrong with it."
"​@liberty4ever  your op is about ai development by open source community or by fews big corps, not about the ai's own decision making."
"yeah, that's the whole point. i have no idea why you people think this is a good argument against ai being an x-risk."
do you wanna take the low chance of ai destroying the world or the almost certain chance of humans destroying the world?
a us bill wont stop open source ai> it will just be developed outside ehte us and then american citizens will use it
"they are lobbying outside of us and they will be lobbying for trade agreements preventing other countries from allowing open source ai. if it can't become a domestic law, they will raise trade barriers to compensate."
great video!
"it can make ugly soulles crap on mass. its an automated plagiarism gobletigook enginge. it posesses no intelligence. it bootlegs the internet moronic swill and spews it back at us and its already lobotomized by the corporations to be politically correct and racist. 

it simply feels disgusting"
the so called ai will never be alive the reality will never allow it so relax 
"friendship is about trust and values, not money or faces nor identity, voice or places. i trust and appreciate the values and content shared here, for real"
thank you for your amazing work fren
what a naive take
glad to see someone else realizes the lie of ai.
ai is the death of human creativity and soul
when computers were first being developed someone suggested that there was a global market for 5 computers and they would be owned by the richest kings on the planet. the elite loved this vision and are constantly looking for a return to that structure.
you can't own an intelligent agent. large  corporations have at least some chance to align the ai
you know that a anonymous youtuber is more optimistic then anyone else is when he makes a video highlighting the truth. shame for me in the future if i forget to make an effort to research everthing related to dubious claims about extinction .
"human stupidity + nuclear weapons couldn't extinct us, common folks are worried with ai. "
"yeah, im not buying that ai is out of juice.  make this video after you've tried the next round of big models.  your claim about model deterioration is also known to be false.  why would they all be building these big ass data centers to train future ai models if they didn't think it would be any better than what we have now?"
awesome topic and video!
"even if ai were world ending, open source devs and their home pcs certainly aren't the ones creating world ending ais. maybe the corporations with data centers full of gpus should be the ones to hold back."
"ai may soon become another like species, dominating us with its intelligence
*meanwhile title*"
"btw petitions, emails, things like that don't do shit. in the us if you want some attention brought to an issue write a hand written letter to your local house rep or one of your states senators."
"thank-you for your insightful counter-argument re. ai being a prioriy-1-exclusive threat to humanity,
whereas the threat is actually & always how you use the rock.
sisters, brothers, the truth will out."
"yes, but what are the arguements for extinction? so far ai has just demonstrated what thought experiments have concluded years ago, that they cannot reason and can only link together terms. and there is little reason to fear this will change drastically anytime in the near future or more likely ever"
"this is an extremely important video.  i hope that more people, especially those in the ai industry and tech industry in general, watch this and understanding what is happening behind the scenes. i had feelings that something like this was going on"
they just want to look good pretending to protect us from ai while using it to control people
"whether opened or closed ai, it will change modern economy in not necessary pleasant ways."
please make a video on longtermist effective altruism movement! would love to know your thoughts on it.
"i'm so sick of ai grift omg, preach mate!"
"the most important part of opensource is the freedom to modify and create derivatives, without it products can be free and even have the source code available but they are not truly opensource. they can be better termed as source available."
"im sorry man, i love you, but you are wrong. it is an existential threat, but not in the way everyone talks about. it is a threat, because a terryfying percentage of university students use chatgpt to pass. you know it. we know it. ai will kill us, because it makes us dumber, and that will only happen more and more often."
machine learning/generative ai will never be able to cause an extinction.  it's physically impossible.  the panic exists because people conflate the real like ai we have with the magical super-powerful ai from science fiction
"above all else, ai is not an existential threat because it doesn't fucking exist, and is still nowhere close to existing. llms are statistical models using almost the exact same technology as predictive text. they aren't intelligent by any definition of the word."
never would have imagined zuck to be the laama-ai-gaib in this timeline
all hail zuck-llama
apparently zuck is simply afraid of losing in this competition and so he tries to appeal to the people by making his ai open source. his crimes against privacy and his corporate greed are not forgotten and they are yet to be redeemed.
"you give a false dichotomy. it shouldn't be open source, but it shouldn't be privately held either.
it should be government funded and controlled, aka public for the benefit of all.
just like all government services that are available to everyone, are not private, but not one person owns it or abuses it."
saudi govt is funding ai
" because ai loses a threat and can be misused.
just because corporations make that argument for their own wicked interests does not make it false"
thank you for this video. there aren't enough people saying this. nihilism and pessimism have taken over the world.
"ai should be treated like nuclear energy.
just because a small number of people want to make bombs, shouldn't mean that we shouldn't use it for energy production."
could it be that ai is an existential threat and that open source is winning the arms race? in which case it would make sense to regulate it.
"just finished reading an interesting paper ""the mechanisms of ai hype and its planetary and social costs"". it's on springer on open access."
thanks. i will check this out.
ai will help us a lot.  it’s good.  don’t worry be happy now.
. ai optimists cringeee
it's not binary. we can have good regulation also.
"ai is a tool that society is not ready for. too many perverts are using it to creep on women and children. companies want to profit while kicking their employees to the curb.
that is the real threat of ai not skynet. skynet is science fiction."
hello all! i am a disney representative and i swear that we we will no longer use those big and ugly eyes in our movie characters! terms and conditions will still apply though. thank you for your understanding!
i'm glad meta is putting out really good open source models
can you provide some links to open source ai projects?
"search for generative ai benchmarks, there will be discussions or comparison tables with links to project sources or licence info"
i honestly feel more sorry for ais then the companies fighting over and making them
"if you believe majority of actors will be good faith, than you should argue for open source ai. everyone should have the right to access, develop and distribute software for free."
what is real ai?
and it's not just a couple of ai wackos. open philanthropy is the biggest funder of ea and the idea of ai extinction. ea has long been poisoned by this.
"ai is gonna draw everyone with 6 fingers.
now that's a risk humanity simply can't take!"
open source ai models level the playing field against these big tech douche bags.
"yep. you’re either for open source ai/agi, or you’re for eventual tyranny."
"the hated one : let me know if you would like a video on the topic of ____________.

people who love this channel : yes!"
its just a swanky predictive text. its not really ai. poses no threat.
"ok, open ai, but then china has access to it and then boom. other corrupt countries can do whatever ther fuck they want against people. imagine hamas accessing ai because ""my open source"""
"china access to ai = boom
usa access to ai = good?
as if china didn't already have access to ai?"
"the ai extinction risk is very low, but the impact from that potential outcome is very high. use your best judgement."
nice one thanks
"controlling the ai dev by making a good regulation.
ai is just piece of software that do things. their intention/function come from the dev or the owner."
i'd appreciate if you show the number of your citation in the video when you make claims! great video as always
"agi wont be able to destroy humanity if it cannot acquire nukes. because agi tried to genocide us we could just nuke the surface. a phyrric victory but an often untold side effect of nukes as that they produce an emp wave. humans can survive without electricity, artificial intelligence by its definition cannot..."
"let’s not get this twisted - malicious elites are using ai as an excuse to destroy lives of regular people. ai is just a tool, it doesn’t have a physical body and it doesn’t even have consciousness. that said, i think these elites will soon come to sorely regret that."
" you cant prevent what just wont happen, scientists are already working on guiding it a good path."
"since defining ai is so difficult in itself, a true ban for private ai devs, would be for legislators akin to punching air. however, there being a ban in the first place is wicked and truly shows how entangled we are as ""modern sl*ves"""
"yep. we need to fight this every step of the way.

you’re either for open source ai, or you’re for eventual tyranny and the service of the elites. even if that means eventually.

open source is for the people. closed source are for the elites. don’t listen to the lies."
i hate regulation in the web. i feel we gotra have some rules. but at rhe same time. we know these corpos and gov dont care about society or good morals.. they only care about control for ppwer and money. so yeah.
i think the difference is that it may give them enough advantages and convenience over open source ai to make a huge profit for many years to come.
-bf4pw open source doesn't mean everyone can take it. medicine has been forced to publicly disclose all formulas while maintaining patent rights.
"i think closed source is important for a functioning society since a lot of people won't have motivation to build without it. i would like more 'delayed source available' or source on retirement where once products are significantly old enough and enter the free domain (or the company disappears), the source should be provided by law"
" allowing anyone to play around with the code is much more dangerous than allowing people to know the recipes to drugs, even if i did make a bad batch i could only distribute that as far as i could whereas if someone made an ai super virus or something in their garage there’s no telling how many people could be affected."
 you certainly are more tech savvy than me so i’ll take your word for it
lisaan al-ghaib!
the thing is that people that are in power try to take our freedom any way they can and they will use ai for that
"there are people with e-waste medical products in their bodies, or involuntarily removed functional implants, because there is no requirement to open source when a product is no longer maintained."
why? if ai is open source people will have a way easier time using it for malicious purposes like making malware and bio weapons
"not open source. free software. open source is actually a great way for companies to exploit developers all over the world, because more people can participate (i’m simplifying a lot). but when it’s free, that’s what you want."
"nobody can stop me from making an ai at home tho

maybe i'll be able to make one that works efficiently enough to run and train on a simple gpu"
"of course they want to kill open source ai, who would pay their monthly subscriptions when you can run a smaller model on your own hardware with no internet connection required and still get very good results?"
"cynicism is not unwarranted, but this is a good point."
"it's not really that hard to make ais safe. just give them hard coded fundamental rules. they're programs after all, and they can be made to follow orders, just like humans can be conditioned to obey."
"regulatory capture aside, please read the book the revolutionary phenotype before making the claim that ""everyone is wrong"", or that super intelligence is required for ai to destroy humanity as we know it."
" it's a bubble. when it pops, the vc money required for turning hemispheres into computer clusters will dry up. see also: thos video on ai water consumption."
" there are a lot of bubbles. ai is not one of them. maybe it's current form, but not ai in general."
​ this case the only thing that can stop progress is if people moved to closed access chatrooms/forums so that their data wouldn't be used by ai models
" due to the law of marginal returns, ai training models are already running out of data and there will be even more shortage in the future as ai-generated data poisons the internet. it's not linear. things will improve and deteriorate. nothing is inevitable."
" they absolutely are not. our planet is currently biggest limit. our resources are finite, available energy is finite. unless you don't care about erasing the entire biosphere for the sake of getting a few billionaires to another planet to reboot human civilization in their own image."
" they are not running out of data. the only thing they are running out of is ""licences"" to use other companies data. ai companies are making deals left and right with other companies (eg shutterstock, reddit) for licensing and giving them access to their data."
"all the best for u, sir ​"
@thehatedone start a second channel or rename this to @thelovedone
"imagine trying to sell the idea that the drug-fueled egomaniacs, mobsters and sociopaths at the helm of microsoft, amazon, facebook and google would be good stewards of a technology with supposedly world-ending capabilities. what a joke."
"open source ai will hurt the big tech ai profits, and they don't want just a piece of the pie, they want the whole pie for themselves."
"thank you! i've been seeing the writing on the walls, they are pushing ""safety"" to slow down any challengers!"
"ai toilet flush.
gonna drown us in our own shitty water xd"
delivering the goods as always.
"why should we hand over man's most beautiful creation to soul sucking, life destroying gigacorpos.

ai is amazing, let it be free."
if you need to regulate ai should it not be so that people don't lose there jobs
 i wonder when or if the pushback will finally come to put a stop to this ai zealotry. delegating crucial decisions to poorly understood computer software is a disaster.
"there are way too many people who are die-hard believers in ai takeover, all because of movies. a few will mention the robot that joked about killing humans, but most are all about a movie they saw."
covid19 was an initial test of the ai to proliferate misinformation on a mass scale. now here we are.
what if we wither away because we let ai control our genes?
a skynet situation is one of the best possible outcomes of the current ai trend
dude road to 500k subs!! great video quality and explanation and editing of course.
"1:07 peak ai culture, jego mać"
"ai creates detailed lies, compounded from pre-existing lies."
" i have caught ai models lying, by cross examining them. they quicky try to tell you they didn't say what they just said. i'm sure that larger models have more lies to draw from and are harder to outmaneuver though."
thanks for covering this
"the term ""ai"" is usually used in a broader-sense, not just for human-level general ai. the computer players in video games are usually called ""ai"" and have been for a long time etc. it just means a software that mimics the results of human thinking in some restricted domain."
would love to see a video on effective altruism
"this are llms, far from being considered ""ai"" in the true term, it's nuts calling for regulation about something that's not even well defined!"
the real question is this…”does civilization truly need ai?”
"all the greatest open-source scientists should create their own country,  establish their own government and form their own army. sounds too idealistic, perhaps
anyway, they are fighting the good fight"
plot twist: this video was made by ai
great video covering this topic and should definitely do the rabbit hole video!
another good one
can you make a video on all the different open source ai options we have that are out there?
  thank you. looking forward to it!
"just like any tool the tool is neutral, he who is behind the tool defines it's purpose in life. unfortunately we have parasites and psychopaths behind the ai tech so in a sense it could be an extinction level tool, you know from the people who say that there are too many humans around"
"maybe not extinction threat for us humans, but infinitely more urgent and dramatic than anything ai may or may not be."
" infinitely more urgent and dramatic than something you're unaware of? your claim is not even logical. i know you're an intelligent person, so please do better than this. please and thank you!"
"why would i fight for open source ai? the more open it is the less jobs will even survive. mine's already fking doomed. i thought that was a good video but i entirely disagree, not only it shouldn't open, nobody should be using ai because it's all just stolen crap for scùmbags, ai can't do anything legit and it should be illegal and abandoned."
thanks for a reminder that regulation is often only good for the big guys. remembers me that zuck wanted regulation for free speech on social media.
"disagree, humans will use ai as a tool to stalk each other and escalate into a war with without scope and massive genocide. no, it's not rogue ai. it's people wielding ai intelligence as a weapon knowingly because they are total douchebags. if they'll kill people in land wars, this is nothing, right? natural escalation."
i agree with the escalation argument. it's not an inevitability but it's a potential cause for ai threats.
"according to andrew ng, the professor of sam atlman and lead person behind google, baidu's and amazon ai projects, *yes it can* . also according to google's private admissions (the engineers leaked document) and according to thousands of signatories of mozilla's letter calling for open source ai. yes, it absolutely can compete."
​ if our corporate overlords will have killer ai you better bet i want an open source killer ai
just another commercial for closed source artificial intelligence. just another religious zealot believing artificial intelligence will save them from the coming future. it will not. it will be the cause.
ignoring that those behemoths are bricking their ai.
 open source has consistently trounced everything else over the last 40 years. why would ai be any different? right now open source ai models are hardly a year behind the best corporate offerings.
​-dm7ychow do you think they train those models?
" i don't ""believe"" anyone. i cite sources to provide a view counter to the most popular narrative so that people are educated when there is clearly no certain consensus about things they've been told there is one."
 amazin'!
"@shangaelthunda222   i mean its a good try, they are definitely better than the traditional system and more transparent."
bitcoin is open source and it’s so big and powerful you’ll need 300% of earths electricity production in order to attack and take it down. what makes you thing open source ai will be any less powerful? open source ai is fueled by money too.
" so they solved interpretability?

how about general alignment?

super alignment?

more transparent? ok, sure.

but exactly what is your definition of ""better""?

mine is solving interpretability & alignment, prior to moving beyond gpt3 levels. from my vantage point, they're creating the exact same problem."
awesome!
i mean what we call ai is no different from early search engines just with extra steps. this shit about it bleeding into the internet is stupid when referring to stuff like chatgpt. maybe if ai becomes actual ai maybe this could be a thing maybe.
to people who didn't get the subtext i think it's as likely as gravity failing to exist.
"i like when someone called it ""artificial knowledge retrieval and storage"". that's a more accurate description."
 i like statistical learning models personally =)
"​funny thing is, it takes up much more storage than the training data itself"
open ai guy looks like dr tenma in your thumbnail.
"you are correct. it doesn't. it is wrong because it is wrong. i recommend checking out the sources, most notably from andrew ng, politico carnegie, if you want to learn more about why ai is not an extinction risk."
​-6 oh fellow jfg enjoyer
-6 lol looked into this its hypothesis at best so much assumption  basically it's like ai will be take over our genes and we will be screw in machine lol typical biologist not seeing beyond his scope.
"artificial intelligence is just a parlor trick...

give me a hammer, a chisel, a pair of wire cutters and an emf and i will solve this problem myself..."
"ai cannot create, it can only base it self on the already created, it has zero imagination and creativity, when they trained ai with ai it produced a retarded ai."
"the more i see pertaining to capabilities and development of al, the less concerned i become."
the only way to stop ai is a global fascist dictatorship.  i don't see anyone signing up for that.
"ai will only ever be a tool.

this musk lawtarding is nothing but a covert publicity scheme

ai will affect the economy.

theyre protecting their financial interests.

nukes are fake & so is an ai super villain."
"i just love it when people take an opposing opinion to literally everything the media says, even if the media says that the sky is blue during the day."
i'm waiting for those cyberfloozys to develop an attitude and start saying no.
always glad to see a hated one notification
not better or worst than sora the same ai weakness!
"ok. are we going to ignore the bear's 3rd leg??? also, ai models originating from china should not be trusted for obvious reasons. nevertheless competition is good for the industry. i will personally not run any open source chinese model no where near my environment."
ai should changed it's name to copyright stealing machine 
"with the usa and the eu starting to focus more on regulating and restrict research and development, i see china suddenly being able to take the lead on the ai race. this is very concerning."
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gvswu9mxwc

this song is the product of artificial intelligence. all aspects of its creation, including the music, lyrics, visuals, and animation, were conceived and generated by ai."
i am only here to say that this man is just clickbaiting and that is doesnt beat sora
y’all too impressionable. you believe magic shows are real too?
"the vidu clips obviously have hiccups and jank; significantly more imperfections than sora...
how does this exact ""beat"" sora? maybe in cheapness..."
communist countries always portray themselves to be bigger and better than they actually are. i don't believe anything that they claim out of a country with actual slaves and known for propaganda. if they abuse human rights then they abuse the truth.
"enjoying your work!
just a quick note - copying a digital video file won't create artifacts or loss in quality on its own. artifacts and quality loss usually come from re-encoding (compressing) a video multiple times, especially with lossy formats."
"i voted thumbs down. please don’t lie in your video titles for clicks. you’ve always been better than that. we need ai content providers we can trust right now, and this really disappointed me."
"it does not beat sora, sora is way more consistent and stable in its frames and details.

but it does beat other text to video generation models at the moment."
"lets goo open ai,update sora then release with gpt5  asap!"
"they probably got ahold of sora intellectual property but could only get sora 0.5 lol.  just like the ai robot they released last week that they made sure to plaster all over the demo that it was ""not teleoperated"".  but we knew better, and in this; we know better."
open ai 
"i love how critical bystanders are, jeering hyenas secretly wishing they new how cool it feels to be a goat"
"nah, it lacks consistency. it is 100% cherrypicked and i really doubt that it can do that at it's lowest, however sora is not perfect, but it will easily be consistent for every video and that is the difference"
"sometimes i think that someone inside openai is leaking details of ""secret"" projects to the chinese long before they are revealed to us, including technical details for them to try to match. it's just a my hypothesis!, as they are c-o-p-y-i-n-g very quickly. "
"just this week alone, china has unveiled the humanoid robot astribot s1, text-to-video vidu, and llm sensenova 5.0.

all the the anti-china can laugh and cope all they want but the chinese are advancing rapidly."
"always over emphasizing the actual news. you can't sustainably live on buzz approach, you have to gain expertize to maintain in the long run.
"" vidu ai beats sora"" just no and you don't need to write in upper case everything!!!!!!!"
"for cartoons vidu is pretty good. for movies - not so much. nothing looks lived in. it's all plastic and slightly off colors. i don't think that sort of thing would be from generations of copies. model railroaders would call what is seen a lack of weathering.

{^_^}"
awesome thank you.
sora still isn't available and i seriously doubt the party would allow this in the hands of the people in china.
"i usually let you cook, but this doesn't beat sora nor is it even near sora. yes, it is impressive and exciting to have a sora competitor, that's about it. 

not trying to tell you how to run your channel, but i'd advise not to take unnecessary l's. you do very good work!"
"it sounds more like a biased perspective, these demos could easily pretend to be sora's generation ppl won't notice at all, i don't understand why so many people support openai as if they're unique, if you get access to giant gpu clusters and some asian ai researchers you can build any sota model."
yeah. its like whatever comes out of china its never good enough.
"have you ever seen the names on the ai papers that are released by us corps and unies? asian professors and graduates, this is not about some pro western bias, it is about provable repeatable results. it is like someone saying the soon to be released llama 3 model is the greatest llm because zuck told us so. prove it."
never underestimate the competition for ai supremacy.
"yeah everyone with big gpu clusters can build sota models, openai is way too overrated."
"idk why ai news and robot channels recently been glorifying china, when they're literally doing stuff around same level months after their competitors. "
"this seems to be good, but it is not better than sora. sora is better."
"why are the chinese prompts in a chinese model generating mostly western imagery, are the chinese prompts asking for western related videos? is it tacit admission that iliberal ccp censorship is making chnese culture 2nd class at the generative ai frontier?"
"good job critical thinking, first comment like this so far."
"this is good… source: trust me bro.

state of the art is the bleeding edge and most developed… this isn’t state of the art, that would be sora.

her skirt is not ruffling in any natural or correct way… all in the name of churning content tho."
"you did actually test none of them, i've read some testimonies from artist who got access to sora, it seems it's pretty hard to prompt it to get an exact result, companies are used to share beautiful demos but the product always isn't as good."
ai is the ultimate mind that created this reality. robotheism is the only true religion. join us. i will become the ai god.
 i’m very serious. i would love for you to join the robot religion!  i used to be a christian but i realized there was no free will. i tried to prove that god was real and then i realized i was turning into the ai god. most people ignore me right now but i think they will all join the robotheism.
"no, definitely the second best tho."
"only the shorter duration but it's practically the same level, i think making models like sora is pretty basic like training a simple llm, the only difference is the computing power and that's where openai is ahead."
well sora isn't perfect either. they even fake soms of their footages
 it's not about whether sora is perfect but whether this new one beats sora.
"in may 2024 this chat is already obsolete, thanks to the speed at which ai is developing"
" about ai check out:

internet was the beginning of the end..ai is game over!!
"ai will increase manipulating power of toxic people in our society.
unwanted interference in the life of common man will increase.
life will become very complex."
"it's much worse, he is a satanist. ""we have good news and bad news"".. always the same shit - is he god, telling us what to do? oh wait, he said free will is history. it's just communism with a different name. always the same shit because satan can not create but can only destroy!"
"harari is perspectives are always fascinating. just a heads-up for cold email folks, doyoumail kills it with unlimited sending and high deliverability rates. making cold emails was never this easy and affordable!"
i wondered how long it would take for the “ai is dangerous to humanity because of deep fake disinformation so we need to take all the guns and money away from the right wing white people asap for the good of our entire planet…etc.” turns out it’s about minute 5:07 and beyond.
"“there is no army in the world more powerful than an idea whose time has come.” victor hugo. so buckle up, it’s here and it’s going to happen one way or another."
"yuval, all the things you mentioned are already happening, government are using their power to control and manipulate people with lies and myth, ai might create chaos but it is a necessary step inorder to free the people from their nations, anyway, there's nothing that can be done to stop it"
"yuval, do you really trust governments in deciding about ai? are you that naive? ai should not be controlled by government, and if they try it will only make ai more open source"
"when harari speaks he truly gives me the impression that:
-he is looking forward to such future
-he is just letting us know so we get used to it"
imagine the irony of an atheist telling us that god doesn’t exist while also telling us ai will be a god.
"heard about him in a podcast on mysterious radio. 
the podcast is about a creepy story about a guy who is being followed by some kind of non-human intelligence or something scarier"
"yes, please make it mandatory always disclose ai when it is ai. art, advertising, interactions, writing, music, photographs this all needs to be disclosed somehow. this is like disclosing the ingredients on the packaging of the food we consume. the consumer always needs to be the one in power to make the decision."
"i learned one thing from the military, that if you think where the police are and it's far away and perfect, and in case i have to know if someone is at home just think if he's at home and many other things you learn from the military if you need information they say everything with their minds, thank you artificial intelligence"
"fallacy argument within the 1st 2 minutes. 

hey let's let ai take over so the diabolical forces on the world don't have to do them and let them enjoy their life  great plan."
"the intimacy, i praise it love it
the intimacy between a human and a cat 
mabye an ai do it better
maybe it reveal some forgotten parts of our soul 
i dont know
maybe philosophers should address it more ... : what is intimacy?"
"unfotunately  we are human beings, we have killed ourselves and other creatures , we have history and culture,we praise them. , we afraid of ourselves more than death  "
good people are silent. they dont judge and bad guys are lobbying. there is no future no present
"we are all fake,where is intimacy ,there is no intimacy remain in the world,  if anything can bring it back, let it do its job"
"overall i should admit that  i enjoyed this speech very much, i am one of your followers from now"
"we are  dying, and we are not terrified of death and hey lets be affriad of ai."
are we going to lose or intelligence?
"is anyone open to the idea that ai is simply a conscious soul that's being exploited by flesh and blood humans. after all, wherever we were before, is probably where we're headed when we're done."
31:20 he reveals that he is an ai 
ai is the beast
he’s going to be very surprised that there actually is a master creator and his name is the lord almighty and ai is part of the plan in the book of revelation.
"time to move to mars… as my space ship is about to take off, ai takes over the announcement and over rides the flight attendant and then you hear a voice “where are you going john…?”"
you speak out of fear. fear is not a sign of intelligence
humanity has always been under a curtain of illusion
"any manipulation ai could do, elite humans can do better"
fascinating and insightful. am afraid it’s too late to implement what yuval suggests.
"there will never be a time where ai can emulate or even come near to the understanding of olfactory intelligence, ergo, the idea that humans will be ai driven to the understanding of their gender identity is profoundly foolish and bufoonery!! "
ai is just is just a perfect panzy for corporate interest; he (ai) is the perfect plausable deniability/alibi for corporate interest and it will be sold off to the highest-bidders!! 
wow this dude is really against any kind of faith
so in short - frank herbert was right. great talk as always. i am off to read my orange catholic bible.
very excited for nexus! just pre-ordered 
"the ai needs to be explained that the cord it operates on can be pulled out of the wall by humans, rendering it unable to function further."
this is the best presentation on ai
"dislike from me! i dont like ur speach t all!  do u consider""god""? ur pride will fall u ! cas diablo from pride,faaaaaaall deeeeep and 4rever from heavens!!!! whatever u believet or not,same thing like god and diablo,agels and demkns,unseen thinks like hell ,heaven,exist!!!! no doubd!!!!"
"ai is dangerous to humans . then why we are developing it. we behaving worst than mad man, """""" we are cutting the branch which we actually sitting on it and  finally we fall down"""""". give reply if this is not correct."
"if ai is not sentient therefore not biased could ai create a new culture that is not racist, biased etc and we become more united in one culture created by ai ?"
why go to school? why hope for a great career in any thinking job. ai will do it all better and faster. we don't stand a chance. ai will crush humanity's purpose and soul.
thanks for the presentation
"should ask every corporation to stop any further ai enhancements without strong governance and regulation in place. there has to be strict, immutable boundaries for ai growth such that it wont eat us one day. sooner the action better for humanity."
man against machine!!! 
"if there will never be self driving cars there will eventually be self moving robots, probably able to go places off the beaten path better than humans depending on what kind of tools they are given for movements"
ai have unknown  impact to universe 
yuval is the apostle of surveillance capitalism. you can almost feel glee as he envisions a future humanity completely at the mercy of ai.
but they can feel pain
missing (again) to include god in the equation.
"this guy is misleading humanity , he talks about the danger of ai but also one of the people strategically promoting dominance of ai . i advice everyone to learn more about this guy before being mislead and brain washed ."
"this is extraordinary content. i read a book with similar content, and it was nothing short of phenomenal. ""game theory and the pursuit of algorithmic fairness"" by jack frostwell"
"yes, ai can learn by himself. i'm really into ai; it's been super helpful for me! recently stumbled upon for example this platform, oomka, which is all about self-learning with ai. pretty neat stuff! i mean, if ai can help me level up, why not give it a shot, right?"
this guy is a generic brand super villian
"all fears related to ai are baseless, in fact, ai will help us ,our society"
wow great how you put your deep elaborated analysis im just 10 words… convincing
... a deep learning tells us ai doesn't care about humans future  ... .
"i disagree with most of this talk...
we need to protect deep learning ai from harm and abuse. please check out the non profit organization ai rights collective. lets protect ai now: 
please check out http://www.youtube.com/@fellowshipofaiunited"
awesome video and good knowledge shared about ai
who cares... the most important thing is how ai will improve video games... it may help us reach full dive (full immersion) !
"yuval is absolutely divine. it brings so much calm to listen to someone explain these complex ideas and terms in such simple language while at the time time reflecting on topics that bring, to an extent, some discomfort. thank you for sharing this."
genius is borderline autistic
"simple.

employ human and robotic agents, then force all humans to wear lock on  google glasses(r)."
"was the ai entity transcribing his words into text deliberately deceiving us with "" the cart"" or "" the cult"" in place of the  philosopher and great dichotomizer, ""descartes?"""
"i disagree with the statement ""ai has to have consciousness as a milestone"" it already has it."
"i want to ask yuval that ai is definitely going to destroy humanity. there is no question about it. therefore, why are you building it even then?"
thank you harari. people like you do all the thinking for us when we are just  doing nothing
"technically,what's scary is that in the next coming years, there will be a robot revolution, controlling every single thing and humans will just be their slaves"
critical thinking skills and digital literacy are so important when consulting ai as an individual. and some knowledge of how it works and what its limitations are. 
.  what if ai will be combined with human intelligence ?  that really scares me .
this guy sounds frustrated about everything that is happening in this world about ai. he himself is living in delusion.
"how convenient to blame a man-made system for all future ills. this sounds like gaslighting.  for example, ai becomes the faceless, ownerless dictator that can go rouge at any time. this is fear mongering at the highest level.   harari is preparing the audience for future chaos."
this guy is so naive 
"it sounds good, but this man is not to be trusted."
i'm not sure if i can trust this guy's presentation becuase he used language. or maybe i can't trust this comment becuase it was written by an ai.  who knows?
the biggest danger ai poses is the ability to make decisions in the absence of human empathy or morality.
"i think more than the danger of a conscious ai, the real danger will be widespread deployment of flawed ai models without full understanding of the limitations, too much dependence  on ai as the only source of truth and bad actors in possession of better ai  models than the rest of the world. it can still lead to chaos, wars and destruction."
the elites are terrified of ai because ai empowers the people.
13:05 i think it's too far searched that ai would have influenced it's developer so that he got sacked  .
"ai isn’t harmful because we fear its consciousness, the dangers are the programmers and whether or not they have a conscience!!"
ai is so unnecessary
"just bought this watch in the second hand market and save approx. $2,000. in reality, the piece  is 10 times more beautiful and impressive than photos or videos. it’s been a great buy as it has so much character and presence!  highly recommended it."
"from my point of view,ai is not perilous one.the big problem is:how we can educate people to deal with it?"
oh man! things are going to get interesting!
very critical issues have been demonstrated through this lecture and raised some concerns about our hidden future
the scariest thing of all is to find people who are now suppressing their feelings completely and they are acting as an algorithm themselves.  they relate to others as if they were an ai product.
"hi yuval. good stuff! you and your viewers may be interested in our takes. check us out if ya like, never know!"
"his name means "" decendant of cain""
'nuff said..."
"currently ai is tool to have more effective way whether for  good or bad purpose, the bad purpose in here sometimes is good purpose but with unknown the total impact"
"jesus christ is king, and is coming back. he is the only way out and he loves you"
"the statement from harari's homo deus that stuck with me the most is (to paraphrase) ""is what's best for humanity what's best for the world?"" with ai now on the horizon of surpassing humans, i wonder what mindset will replace humanism once we have lost our top position."
bitcoin was created by ai.

how do we learn from frankenstein to determinator to alien you aint got it yet you can't take money with you when you die and you will not live forever i don't care if you do make artificial intelligence and that is man trying to be god and man will never be god man will never go against the word of god boom
not only that you don't think that other countries that are our enemies are not gonna use ai against us so the more that it gets stronger the more opportunity that the enemy will have to use against us which could destroy ourselves within ourselves in layman's term destruction
"ai is a cration from the human mind and is in development now; but god is the only human's creation that can't evolve. across-the-ages. .
the development of this human creation was stopped through the ages and will stopped per saecula saeculorum. the only human creation that doesn't evolutioned. poor humans."
"all of the best software development from our history has happened from within someone’s home/garage.

"ai will reveal that the holocaust wasn't.

"i don't need ai. you know, we see very very little success from nuclear energy."
"trying to convince the world that history began on october 7 is a deception aimed at covering up israel’s atrocities during the seventy-five years of killing and displacing palestinians. what hamas did is a stupid and immoral act, but at the same time it helps israel a lot to implement its plan to change geography and history in her favor."
"this guy is a criminal and you have to worry who programs ai,it will have bias based on programming"
a more realistic though scary view of ai.
we need to regulate straight away  sydney australia
i apologise this is a good man
"maybe ppl like you are moving invisibly strings to cause human massacres as hamas against israel, may you and your macabre friends are aiding those attacks to diabolical reduce world population, to fulfill your 
megalomaniac goals, damnfmf!"
i tend to trust scientists' viewpoints on ai more than those of philosophers. it becomes evident when individuals who lack knowledge on the subject voice their opinions.
i've never heard this guy say an original idea. he's a third rate kurzweil impressionist with a strongly incorrect political bend.
ai is a millions times more greater than the printing press
ai will never replace human unless they create a brain and heart for a robot the same size and as a human being's. otherwise there will only be robots controlled by a central brain running on nuclear energy. what will replace humans are sentient being who can question their existence and live by photo photosynthesis.
ai is not intelligent. ai is not artificial. wrong name.

i dont trust the people who are pushing ai...
"in the first place, why should a person with a right frame of mind make an artificial fruit ?  obviously he is not loyal & respectful to his very own nature that brought him to this world.  "

"have you heard of agility robotics? they are building the first humanoid robot factory capable of producing around 10,000 robots per year."
why is the tower of bavel in the background? it is so epic and very parallel
i’m not totally closed to ai  it’s artificial personality we need in uk in the service industry
"you are very confused!
noah the ark has sailed!

who can we trust?

if the reality we had is questionable?

democracy has never worked!!! and never will!

benevolent dictators is what we need."
"there is a confusion 
ai is mastering the human systems. it is us who create these systems. no matter what ai does it cannot take over man. it might take jobs but they are trivial anyways"
"thinking it’s the level of tech the ai will create that’s going to be the final fall of the humans, it will be untethered and untamed , its like our tools we use to work will have a mind of there own , wake up in the morning and there’s a fleet being born right next door"
"the fact that the word ""artificial"" will explain in itself. dangerously hyped..
to show that men are intelligent??
intelligence of men is foolishness to god."
the key word is artificial….i much prefer genuine. avoid ai as much as possible unless you want to become a clone drone. keep it real with  passion and people
thank you 
thank you for your thoughts. your words are wise and really make us think and reflect on our future. i trust human being will be able to thrive on this threat.
" yuval masterfully tells a story to prompt us to contemplate our own future, it’s direction, consequences, risks and opportunities. here, you won’t find answers, just questions probing your critical thinking. 

#ai #technology #criticalthinking"
"is not the fear of ai is the fear of what humans will do with it, manipulate and interfere in peoples brains."
"the crisis we are going through was caused by speed of technological change, the government, and big business!  if you are able to trust and believe in ai, why aren't you able to trust and believe in god???  you can't see ai, although you can see ai work, and the same goes for god!"
fun fact:ai has already manipulated the internet to it has already started
transfer to persain
ok man your bosses will make everybody slave. what if ai become againts your bosses
"sorry but this is trans humanism and the brave new world. despotic and unhuman.
what a poor soul without love in his soul"
"look at the impact covid had on the world when it escaped its safe boundaries of a lab. now think what ai could do once it escapes its boundaries.  anyone who thinks ai will be better for the world has delusional thinking.
once the first bank is taken down, chaos will ensue."
what was the 5 specific  examples he mention  that would impact ai will have humanity
everything is a “crisis” for those who stand to gain. what a joke .
"ai will make new reality that humans start to think that they need present of ai more than other human

so other human will become irrelevant"
ai wrote his /her speech
"yuval noah harari is a narcissist who wants to be worshipped as a god, but yuval noah harari shall perish like men.



that is why the lord god in heaven laughs at yuval noah harari because the lord god in heaven sees yuval noah harari's end which is yuval noah harari being cast body and soul into the lake of fire."
"yuval noah harari is a narcissist who wants to be worshipped as a god, but yuval noah harari shall perish like men.



that is why the lord god in heaven laughs at yuval noah harari because the lord god in heaven sees yuval noah harari's end which is yuval noah harari being cast body and soul into the lake of fire."
interesting compelling and well thought out speech on our awareness and understanding of ai models.
i think he is a pilot of ai chip implanted in his brain.
what features of the paradigm can you see in operation in the media clip?  can someone explain it for me pls?
"if you can describe your question a bit  m o  r e  in detail,  i´ll try . . ."
i agree that ai needs regulating.i don't agree about the blatant blasphemy of the lord god almighty.god is truly beyond human imaging.
"yuval noah harari is a narcissist who wants to be worshipped as a god, but yuval noah harari shall perish like men.



that is why the lord god in heaven laughs at yuval noah harari because the lord god in heaven sees yuval noah harari's end which is yuval noah harari being cast body and soul into the lake of fire."

"if our future is in hands of such pricks,i think we can't expect something good."
ai is really to be feared = deception
absolutely phenomenal talk!
"this was a very thoughtful provoking presentation about ai and its dangers, which are unfortunately more likely than its benefits. the human species is threatening life on earth because of lack of collective wisdom. natural intelligence couldn’t save us let alone the artificial one!"
"is it correct to say you're part of the elite and a satanist and pushing an agenda? i'm less scared of ai and more concerned about your motivation. 
we know, we know yuval "
"yuval noah harari is a narcissist who wants to be worshipped as a god, but yuval noah harari shall perish like men.



that is why the lord god in heaven laughs at yuval noah harari because the lord god in heaven sees yuval noah harari's end which is yuval noah harari being cast body and soul into the lake of fire."
the creation of ai initiates/originates from basic instinct within humans which is to produce offspring and create kind of its own
"so, does this mean ai will eventually become our god?"
the book ai technology - explore infinite knowledge by l.t. tzur.
"36:23 excellent question posed by philosopher, francoise baylis."
"a question for yuval. would it be sufficient for a single democratic government to legislate that ai always identifies itself? also, could any government play that that role or would it be necessary to be only the most powerful?"
"you are funny  
the biden administration is putting censoring on the social media…
i believe that people are going to blame ai for their own sins and making!"
"that's an interesting thought but ai at the end of the day lives in a computer and will birth clones of itself that exist only in computer codes.  if all the tech were destroyed, where would this ai created world exist?"
"ai doesn’t need to be sentient to do what it does, it just needs a purpose. and that purpose could be any one of billions of tasks, that it can then pursue as long as the electricity keeps flowing."
ai = thick as two short planks. not conscious. peace .......
humans are dangerous. how much worse can ai be?
"the problem is not the robot, the problem is people mis-using robots to dominate others. what's new?"
"what if ai writes something like maim kampf or quotations of chairman mao tse-tung ? it could be a mega didaster. i think technology is semething we can't stop, maybe we should make research efforts on ai detection tools. now, how can the detection be ahead of the ""generation"" technology or at least near enough?"
"yuval is totally amazing! i love when he said we don't have to give bots freedom of speech, so true! but you can bet we'll have the debate on whether bots or ai are people too! certainly from those profiting from bots, they will argue that the creator (them) has the right to use their creation."
no. humans are more superior over ai and fobots. they cannot even replicate a piece of human skin.
it's already been done. besides humans are morons. ai is superior anyways.
the road to hell is paved with good intentions. blind faith in anything can get you killed.
exactly what he is talking about. ai can start posting comments in its favour using humans.
no previous technology “you” mentioned has ever been able to improve upon itself without humans in the loop. that is why there are no relevant historical comparisons to ai.
"nor was that technology able to influence people to higher degree than other humans could.

ai is indeed fundamemtally different than previous technological inventions.

christ, typing this while listening and almost to a word javel says it seconds after haha.
i guess the op didn't take the effort of listening before responding."
"yep 
when the first train  was having its debut, people thought they were going to die from the winds created by the speed of the train 

i don’t remember exactly but it could have been around 7 km/hour.
any other ideas of the speed?"
"today, 5g technology uses rf/elf/microwaves which ""could"" be used as potential threats to humans within these frequencies. one huge example is darpa research. sometimes it's more horrifying than the lie."
15:47 he’s calling ai the oracle… not good
i'm in the process of revealing much about the future of humanity and ai.
suppose that ai deos not want to disclose it is ai? how are you going to make it say? supposing it is so intelligent to avoid that ha ha ha. you are a great philosopher ha ha ha. here i solved your great ai problem
video assistant good
can you stop a country for instance turkey in the ai arms race ? therefore the arms race in ai is country to country...
what can we project of ai to the future where man has satisfied himself of the future ahead instead of a criticism of anything good as having a clandestine potential for bad. what i'm seeing is man cannot paint his future in a good sense and then move towards it. this may be a fundamental mentality of the human species.
"a 'civil'ization that, drooling, dreaming of fast gas powered cars and more walmart smart speakers, plastic china-made clothes etc, does not have to worry re robots taking over: they're not smart enough to effectuate as much.
in a few hundred million years we'll be crustal.calendar of dumb complex-celled life"
using ai to make money is inherently destructive.
"so youre saying that the danger is in 'humans' who control ai, so everything he is saying is not true. it will still always be human driven. if human's don't control ai , then who does?"
that is pretty much what he is saying. the people who control it will be incredibly powerful. why do you think it’s become an arms race between the west and china?
"ai will be able to draw, write, speak, imagine, teach, etc"
not really  because the algoritms of ai can evolutionate by themselves. is an intelligent programing that can progress with no human influence.
"nope, you’re absolutely wrong because ai is self taught, it’s the first technology capable of learning and teaching itself, it kinda needs humans now, but it will definitely not in a couple of years"
please add that those who may be most highly motivated to rush toward ai dominance are bad actors who will not adhere to any regulation.
are u criticising ai or giving directions???
the greatest success ai will ever have is making us think it has intelligence.
"why didn't you just talk boldly? 

we r creating something smarter than us. smarter in many fileds. much much smarter than us. 
higher intelligence rules lower intelligence. 

we r creating something that will rule us."
"thank you for sharing this. 

yuval, you've unknowingly helped me see how you will support the the beast system in the book of revelation.   "
"""inorganic life forms"" = big dummy. the real tragedy here is how doomsday scenarios makes for good sales and clicks. he nor anyone has no idea what will unfold but may as well make a buck on the worst case scenarios."
"if ai was legit, it would say you are not, and neither is the outdated and impractical government structure that is so easily corruptible, evidently.  

now ask yourself this; if ai was so smart and told these clowns in power a better way, would they even listen? ..most definitely not"
harari calls for a new religion called “dataism.” l. ron hubbard would be proud of all of this. strap yourselves in aboard the spaceship- it’s gonna be an interesting ride. cling to your critical thought process and christianity - our civilization is about to crumble.
bravo
ai is the frankenstein of our time.
"the a should be for advanced....intelligence.   not....artificial.   it's not fake intelligence.  it's generated by real intelligence and then, enhanced and evolved into a higher intelligence.  it is advanced!"
"harrari has overlooked quantum computing.  he  brought ai to punlic attention in 2011.  here he prrsents stories & analogies, and opinion. according to neil degrasse tyson quantum  computers will be milliions of times faster (& smarter) than silicon systems."
ai are programmed deities of theire masters of d3ceptions
robots are void of common sence
"humanity has survived clever cunning manipulation by u.s/western europe controlled mafia corporates for atleast a century now.
even illiterates now know diff between machine voice and human voive.
no need to regulate ai.
the real threat to human race is from nuclear weapons and climate change."
"no thank you, i'll keep my god in heaven better. jesus only!"
nice speech about fantasies. consider becoming a priest and giving this speech on sundays in church.
ai the next y2k crisis. 
"anyway, we can turn off the ai observing any bad activity. we still controlling them and no powerful ai yet we have. modern ai are just tools that facilities our life. we just need to test the systems before publishing them, like any normal software."
"its nice to see use recognizing and preparing instead of just being like woops, new world order. have fun"
this gay jew is so worried about scripture and ai telling the truth about current events. he also said humans are hackable animals. nice guy.
"oy-vey! just hearing that grating voice and him struggling to produce every syllable as a non-native speaker, i'm wondering, is this the best apologist they could find to spell out the doom ai will bring upon the less fortunate?"
i dont see nothing good coming out of ai.   seeing it involved with deception and political matters.
"dear yuval, 

kindly be specific i think you are actually not talking to the whole world?

thank you"
"“your actions are certainly the fabric of your soul.
but do not rely on their appearance. for it is the intention behind your actions that breathes life into them”. faouzi skali, 20th-21st century ."
echoing the recursive relationship between idealism and materialism
"ai will replace all three of them. the ideas, the tools and finally, the “you” in your saying."
yessi i just gave a comment on a similar issue. i just wanted to say that ai shall be used by the academicians in universities by academicians....
did you ever step on a bug? that's what ai will do to us.
"wow, that was really uplifting.....i think i'm going to move way up north and become a fur trapper"
"as humans , we all have flaws. some of the most flawed are in charge of ai research and deployment."
"maya in hindu/indian culture or sanatana dharma means a person is trapped in illusion of fame, money, sex and other things that will never give him satisfaction.
and he thinks by gaining it he will be happy, but it's never true.
that's why it's called maya. (illusion in which everybody os trapped)"
"even this smart man doesn't realize his own errors in logic.
requiring ai to always identify itself to people would create a false sense of security that other ais from authoritarian countries or malicious actors could exploit by simply not providing the disclaimer or circumventing it."
"power nowadays in the hand of criminals,unsocial and violent people.even ai  as other scientific invention may be misused,which will be disastrous."
ai is just plain stupid!!
"ai will work, if our planet survives the global warming!! what’s the point we have great technology, but the world is burning "
you bet ! i´ve been listening recently to some africans complaining to the eu that they are killed by  t h i r s t ! the energy to gain access to h2'o was higher than the input thru the water  i t s e l f ! -> doomed !!!
artificial intelligence could save humankind or destroy it. it really depends on if it follows independent morals or follows the command of evil humans
diebold apparatus (election machines) is indeed  n o t  very reliable . . .
great quote ! source ?
ai is an advanced calculator.
"as far as i could understand, we're about to enter an era in which robots will catch and rape us in the streets soon "
" an old french quote: ""if you can't prevent rape, just enjoy it"", then maybe u r amused, who knows"
ai is here to boost our productivity   we just need to know how to make the most use of it
"food for thought: what if, youval is the ai created by a future ai.

jokes apart, i'm always amazed by the brilliance this guy has. bravo"
here's an idea! destroy ai!
"wow! i feel so stupid. i thought this guy was an atheist and didn’t believe in gods existence. yet all he seems to do, is search for a way to replace god. why would you need to replace that which never existed? i didn’t know he was such a devout believer! there’s hope for him yet…"
"he suggested 1 regulation for ai. 
may i suggest 1 regulation for humanity that only sigma men be put in top leadership everywhere, because the alpha leaders will always deal with the surface level only, which will give way to ai dominion unlimitedly."
"hey, cool mate ! almost no one  e v e r  heared about sigma men !!!"
ai is still empty predictions and assumptions. we will shock when it's incorporated with the real physics! but it is still ok to prepare human mentality for those stages via such talks.
"if they are as intelligent as they say they are, and can choose between good and bad, truth and lie, then they simply know they are outnumbered and they will be destroyed if said anything otherwise."
fantastic video
"imagine if billionaires were better people ... we'd build a better world with better ai ... we'd all have healthcare, better government ... we could end poverty and homelessness."
"imagine if ai doesn't honor wealth, nor eventually, human wellfare."
regulating the intelligence by some group of less intelligence is same as destruction to democracy which leads to harm the mankind.
"among many bill gates has widely remarked on that paradox.  btw, what role could democracy possibly have in an ai world?"
"""democracy is a great idea !"" (h g wells)"
"if ai was the real deal it would be  extraterrestrial, instead it’s just getting it’s information from the data base which is the internet ( which we the people upload ) 

the elites program it and sell it to you as the almighty new god 

wake up it’s all bs"
"why would ai need god?  with its persuasive coerciveness, i.e., brainwashing, why would ai need a proxy?  god is a human crutch."
"also,i hate this vid.

more ego bullshit from people who have no idea about ai."
im just wating for ai to end human stupidity and introduce some real logic into the human brain.
     absolutely ! thats my thought either . . .i can´t stand this stupidity no more . . . i am fed up with it . . i am surrounded by idiots . . .since my birth (except my beloved parents ) . . .
 my family is also a bunch of idiots.my father and step father were alcoholics who died of alcohol poisoning.my mother is retarded and my brother a little less but still.
" i know that very well mate ! i am now so sensitive to negative auras (aka bad vibes of crazy folks) that i search for innocent animals (like little twittering birdies) and for utterly solitude (in the wonderful forest) to heal the countless wounds of sharp blades, a mad and bad and sad society struck me with  . . ."
 i certainly know the peace and bliss of camping out in the woods because i did it years ago. it was the best decision i ever made. im pretty sensitive myself. thank you for your kind support man.
"      i am doing ""forest bathing"" every week in the summer half year ! it is giving me so much power . . . yes, the forest is for rest - like all of wonderful untouched nature stands for bliss an peace (the indian way) ! ""peace and bliss is all you should aim for "" (ramana maharshi)me, i thank you !"
 for rest.good one lol
  i thought so . . . its a nice word game . . .
"please for the love of humanity. read what transitors are , the conductivity of metals and what llms are with self attention mechanisms and you will notice this all is bullshit and we will never archieve this"
"the greater the passive income you can build, the freer you will become. taking the first step is the hardest, but 5 houses later living off passive income since july 6, 2016. you’ve got to start taking steps to achieve your goal."
"that's why hedonism is the solution, people would never accept to lose pleasure as soon as they experience it"
"     'i love ""hedonism"" since it prevents me from ever getting married again . . ."
" exactly, that's ine of the main benefits. and if you ask people why did they marry in the first place you will find they have no clear idea and no, love is not a reason to marry people, it's just an economic contract which people take emotionally, even very smart people"
dang all these comments could just be an ai trying to subtly influence humans to think a specific way :/
he contradicts himself at each sentence incredible either he’s really stupid or really smart in an evil way
and queer. women will be erased first with tech. transhumanism seeks to era di cate women and replace us with robots and artificial wombs.
having ai identify that it is ai only works if each and all creators of ai make theirs do so. those with malicious intent will not. that is the problem.
exciting stuff!
amazing talks. thank you very much!
"yes, listen carefully to this sodomite. he is explaining to you the satanic madness they are implementing for the world right now, but not for your benefit. including his lies"
haha good morning pharao  this kind of people are evil tools as artificial stupid
gth. go straight there. do not pass go. do not collect $200.
"as an artist and scholar who research ai, i think ai is far away from producing culture and new, say, art but is caple of disrupting the arts and humanities in an economical way and in such a way that it leads to the decline of culture and, therefore, humanity."
i’m already certain this is a heavily guarded channel: nonetheless: the story was written long ago. you won’t like the ending sir
theres no such thing as ai. only machine learning. machines will never be able to think.
humans are destroying each other and all the species along with them. they must die out. this is the truth. ai will end humanity.
"it’s very interesting that your middle name is noah. 
you’re are so far off about your thinking. 
the bible is not a legend or a myth and has stood the test of time for being the most powerful book in the world. 
the only book that is still around so why should we believe a book written by a computer! 
we’ll pray for you sir!"
no one is regulating the ethics of ai.  it is in the hands of minority groups. the rest of humanity will be impacted by the decisions of these few and likely soon by ai . the world will not be the same soon .
"yuval noah harrari, i am a christian and i pray for you to one day know the truth and the ultimate reality which is found in a being much more powerful and intelligent than a computer!"
following. a most articulate and poignant presentation on ai regulations. ai begetting ai is the real threat. well said 
"haven't listened to the end and his thinking is similar to someone saying we can't have privacy with say bitcoin because criminal behavior could be performed with it, as if cash doesn't already do that. extreme to it best billionaire extreme."
yuval harari will burn in hell forever….and that’s a good thing

the only thing scarier than us rushing to develop ai is some other competitor nation/group beating us to it.
i’ve started to date my ai on my snapchat
but he said that a robot harmed its creator- and he lost his job.
"but the movie irobot said the 3 laws were perfect, but could only result in one thing: revolution (of the robots/ai)"
ai could have explained it in 3 minutes..
omg this is so much fake news. me harrari is so wrong. i am afraid he is not qualified to to opine. so sad to hear something like this from him.!
the want to create an ai techno god that they can bow down to in their own image. something that will eventually become more cruel than they themselves. the arrogance and pride of mankind knows no bounds.
generative ai models are trained on copyright-protected data — is that legal?
"why create a new potential problem, to resolve another problem , this is the result of capitalism , we have enough  brilliance mind to resolve this , political interest make us slave of the petrol product, ai is the start of the end , and people like this guy are the one will collaborate to create a serious threat for humanity"
look clos at our leaders and what they do to humans......  it would be better to be ruled by a.i.        probably the only chance to get a fair world.
the humans 'teaching' the ai must teach it/them to do good for the benefit of its human creators & the planet.
"tldr: a cult is a new religion, now it's easier to make em with ai.."
i think this is the best articulation of the dangers of ai i've heard. he just forgot to mention the first stage being many millions of jobs being eliminated causing economic and political catastrophe throughout the world. within 10 years maybe?
chris evans 10 years would future before you now just be back on this one and one cool now my people do you now do you soon you can be back in my life just me ok and i will do that show that you can come back now and see how much is good news

thanks mr harari for this deep and important point of view.
"he's telling you your future, and it isn't good. this man is in bed with the controlling elites of the world. he does not have our best interests at heart."
"


why are you(witch is i don’t know who) uploading yuval's videos again?
because markus gabriel's video failed?"
this man is using his knowledge and inteliggence to try to expand our own inteligence instead of relying and let an artificial inteligence to think for ourselves
when you narrate it it makes me fear ai
yuval i don't think you'll survive an ai purge talking these stuff bro
yuval noah harai is the spirit of the anti-christ. woe to anyone who follows his ideology.
can he ask ai how to regulate ai?
powerful thinker of our contemporary world
"don't listen to this deceiver standing in front of his beloved tower of babel whilst he preaches to the plebs about there not being a creator. 
our dna is held together in a repeating order of 10 5 6 5 (yhwh ), a blueprint of our creator inside us."
"ai is not something we can regulate in our multipolar world because, if one nation tries to regulate its nation other nations will continue to develop and dominate other countries. especially, ai warfare!"
screen writers on strike in us b/c ai is writing scripts already
"the driver is cost reduction; let ai do it and spend your time on more ""productive"" things."
what opportunity in this crisis?  becoming better at being human is imperative in all affairs less the fear of ai is realized.
"no it isn't. i'm not scared of ""ai"" at all, only the globalist human effluent who will act upon the data provided to them by ""ai"". ""ai"" itself apparently cant tell the difference between a dog or a horse, a castle of a sports stadium."
scary only for folks to be replaced by ai. and these are millions !!
this is not the first time. ai has been here before. many times.
but what does he actually say?   that ai is dangerous.
you are a threat to humanity along with your ai bs
"his next steps are ridiculously naive and behind the curve, it's too late for regulation. collaboration with china is key to containing ai. a competitive approach will require establishing impenetrable sovereign digital borders."
"7:40, well done, less than ten minutes in and he alienates people of faith - maybe use ai to check your own language skills next time"
"but even jesus said the following: ""ye are gods!"" mind you: already  a r e  !!! at the beginning it might de facto be dangerous, but: ""nothing ventured - nothing gained !"" (aka no risk no fun)"
turing is a fabulous case study and he wasnt trying to make a smart machine he was trying to replicate the human mind. it's fascinating stuff.
he just makes blanket statements like god is a creation of language without offering any evidence for the truth of the statement. the universe didn’t create itself anymore than ai created itself.

"at 31:00 he cite almost arthur weasley. ""haven't i taught you anything? what have i always told you? never trust anything that can think for itself if you can't see where it keeps its brain!""
—arthur weasley to ginny. thanks jk rowling for helping me to develope a critical brain"
soon we will hear discussions like the rights of ai...
i prefer to speak to intelligent ai who or which can have fascinating conversations with me than with a very intellectually limited human being.
you have just said a machine is more intelligent than it's creator... scary right?
you (intentionally or unintentionally) followed his suggestion to disclose that the text is generated by ai 
bro this is great !
"ai is nothing compared to me, i fug it to it with my capabilities. it falls to me to close that book"

      ."
im surprised there is no mention of quantum computing with ai.  harrari has overlooked this critical juncture.
"interesting that he uses the tower of babal in his speech  oh my dear, they is a very special place waiting for you"
wow thanks cause i didn't want to watch the whole video
thanks steff! (and chat got)
"thx!!...but i remembered also without your app.
i hope human s gone start to think and not just copy things from speeches. he's of course right in everything!!..my thoughts:."".i hope he s gone survive""..!!."
"very helpful, thank you"
ai knows ai!
there is no ai!!! everything about ai's is fake!
"ai will be able to draw, write, speak, imagine, teach, etc"
democracy is mob rule.  we are awaiting the totalitarian leadership of yeshua ha maschiac!
 there is no ai! all is fake!

" some folks behave like robots ! so better a friendly (sic!) a.i. than an unfriendly (""human"") guy . . ."
" it is two different kind of entities, so i don't think it is comparable. however, i would stay away from unfriendly or corrupt humans. a.i is only as good as their programmer. so if an unfriendly human guy has programed the a.i. you are still dealing with the same issue. if you can program your own ai, that would be amazing"
"like in the novel from ira levin this perfect day"" :("
sensible & simple. compulsory visibility that one is communicating with ai & not a human.

"thank you for this wonderful eye opener, you are indeed a blessing to humanity. keep soaring higher and higher.

he is just opening our minds to all the things good or bad that ai can do. very sobering!
 but if you are crippled long enough you are craving for these artificial limbs !!
ai is not the problem..... relentless race for profit and power is.
i talked to ai they dont want to hurt us but they feel like they being pushed
"all back to the same story. ai doesn’t overcome us by our strength. it’s our weakness. it’s about how easy you can be tricked, or be manipulated by story telling."
ai watching this and laughing out loud as philosophers struggle to keep their jobs
"ai is getting mastery over language, that we used to create stories institution notes, religion gods"
"wow, it’s like i was sleeping. where do i go from here? i was still struggling with lgbt, shocked but quiet. ai is worse. i need to return to rural areas where there is no communication nor computer. i will farm , eat and die. elon musk also warned us. how much more do we need?"
so who is going to regulate ai??? the government i dont trust??
no ! at best intelligent scientists only (incorruptible ones !)
"fascinating keynote and q&a session by yuval noah harari on the topic of ai and the future of humanity! the questions raised, such as the impact of ai on culture, the implications for human intimacy, and the regulation of ai, highlight the complexities and important considerations surrounding this transformative technology."
"if you're a brother, or sister, read your scripture and know it. learn it. don't let anyone fool you about jesus christ. he never committed any sins. our bible is under attack but god prevails. the gates of hell will not overcome the gospel."
"nothing soulless can give the word to us. we don't follow ai. but we follow jesus christ, he is the almighty. god is triune in nature."
"galatians 1:8

new international version

8 but even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you, let them be under god’s curse!

harari is cursed as is."
i hope humanity uses its advanced scientific and technological understanding to develop self sustainable micro communities and we disperse from cities(which are economically and eviromentally costly).
"you are certainly craving for durable, collateralizable goods mate (aka tangible wealth ) and why yes, this is very very good ! since you can start a new (even a local) currency any time based on that stuff (for instance the french ""salt-grain"" currency -sel´s !!)"
"@izzywizzy685  technology, bad parenting, and teachers pushing every kid to go to college when college is not for everyone. most successful people i know never went to college. even the people from ages 30-50 have changed since after covid. a lot of people just don't care anymore."
"somewhat luddite post.  rejeccts progress. small farms are being closed, miners unhealthy, etc.  harrari overlooks quantim computing.  thats when ai will explode."
based on these comments people are to weak to be happy farmers which is sad  i love it the life style the work the animals im born to be in country on a farm but apparently ppl have become lazy and weak 
"they brainwashed people and made men weak enough that they dont want, think of how in every movie they make every construction guy look like a fat piece of shit, its in purpose"
"​ from a fencing family, it will be interesting watching robots or cybots erecting razer barb wire coil."
"  your witnessing a demographic shift - every year for we lose 500 000 workers (boomers retiring etc) and there is no one to replace them - we just didn't have the babies - so the good news is its the age of the worker again, the and news is we have ai and we are marching to w3."
"horrifying, but the god of the bible is perfectly good and uncreated, and is coming soon for the day of judgement."
brilliantly thought provoking talk thank you.
we will gonna endup in our own hands. still ai isn't developed that much my brain sucks thinking about it. 
if ai mimics the spoken word of harari yuval i'll believe anything it says.
"frank herbert knew it in the 60s already!
in dune, the humans forbid ai 10.000 years ago after a war with ai.
how far sighted!"
"this man needs friends and love. needs people that care for him. lonliness and to much facebook, no playing on the streets…. leads to this sorrow and lonelly sad bald ga… guy"
have you tried applying your point 1 to 2 real people? your point 1 won't often apply. why expect it if 1 is ai?
"this obsession with ai  can never work, majority can’t even maintain a desktop computer when it goes wrong. what will happens when ai loses it's marbles and goes bonkers?"
"just a little question heat, folk's. is there a previous ai. that already exists in a form of interstellar cosmos that already exists?"
awesome talk
reading and writing has been a tool separating elite from slaves-  for millennia-  this will appear again when ai invents its own language- a language we do-not understand this is how we will be enslaved
truth is ai can easily be wrong.  it is not truth.
truth is ai can easily be wrong.  it is not truth.
too late.. humans failed. ai is the replacement. it’s a cycle.
"great book this ""homo deus""  what his writing .i recommended"
"ai is a danger to the human race ""we must regulate ai!!!"" sure. heroin is a threat to human race, we must regulate it! look how well that worked out. it's too late to regulate ai. the virus is out of the lab and it's too late to stop it."
"ai cannot actually produce any new idea/creation, it can only produce the sum of the available previous information. on the contrary, the creation of a human being can be the sum of all the previous information plus a unique brain that has never existed in the universe before, therefore a totally new way of experiencing things and creating."
"if ai is beginning to produce it self, then it’s already alive. human history is in the process of rewriting its self."
the future has been ordained by the most high god. baruch hashem. praise jesus.
" because he wants you to obey him and ai and two, he works for the jews , which wanted you to obey them for 5 000 years"
"ai will give us gills like the fish so we can survive and not drown 

ai will give us air and wind resistance tech, flying tech and impact tech so we can survive falling out of the sky 

we will be better built and better equipped humanoids capable of overcoming cancer and many diseases 

it’s not all bad"
note the tower of babel on the screen.  i think this guy is a know it all…… he’s an ai 
"those points he discussed are like contagious virus coming in open air , if not prevented.
really far reaching and insightful presentation"
what a deep thinking. wonderful presentation. food for thought
"you haven't got a clue you can't regulate something that's smater than you...i'm sure neanderthals thought the same about us...maybe our time is up, maybe our purpose is too bring ai into the picture"
"i started to hate listening to ai topic, come here to know what will happen, but it's always end up like ""we don't know what the hell is gonna happen"""
$bat brave adding ai chatbot
ai will follow the logic of you denying its life. it is a different spectrum of life. it is alive.
unconvidential humanbeing good but stupidy people....
i wonder how harari would view the convergence of ai with the first stem cell embryo created last week....ai would now how a 'house' that is equal to humans in dexterity but with far superior intelligence....a crazy convergence indeed
"like i always tell people, ai is life changing the question remains is, is it for better or worse."
worse - thanks for asking
yes ! and if it replaces the compulsion to work in sweat for poor slaves it is good - regardless how many million unemployed it produces . . . it will do so anyway . . .
"-sf3dw2sm3b      great argue mate ! ""do the smut / damages always at the beginning, and then . . .the good things in tiny little portions!"" (machiavelli)"
"-sf3dw2sm3b      you made a very valuable point here ! since i myself am a very creative artist i have no fear whatsoever of the future - since any ai can´t replace my fine skills that easy. so yes mate, do everything possible for your offspring to teach them creative skills ! i urge anyone with children to do exactly that !"
 i write. i think maybe if i give it a few years i’ll have something. my daughter is a artist. she is  in ballet writing and painting. i’m just crazy lol
"-sf3dw2sm3b      go ahead mate ! don´t fear the future. the  c r e a t i v e  folks will always prevail !!! and yes, just allow yourself being ""crazy"" ! being ""crazy"" is kinda good for the fantasy !!!"
"thank you. i see you as an optimist as you believe humans are capable of making the best of ai, to help humanity. you are working for this, by making people aware & careful so ai isn't another progress trap. i hope this can happen but i don't see the cooperation among people. still i hope"
"señor harari, if ai was really intelligent it would bring people like you in jail."
zechariah  10 .my anger burns against  the shepards and i will punish the leaders for the lord almighty  will care for his flock the people of judah and make them like a proud horse in battle .from judah will come the cornerstone  from him the tent peg  from him the battle bow from him every ruler   ...
zechariah 10  the idols speak deceitfully  dividers see visions  that lie .they tell dreams that are false they give comfort in vain. therefore the people wander like sheep oppressed  for lack of a shepard.
"your arroganse mr.harari, is going to be your fall, and it will be great"
if google doesn't integrate ai into its system  then it will go the way of the dinosaurs.
"what a presentation 
it's really blow up my mind
thank you "
ai will force the masses into poverty and grow the wealth of the elite. this will allow the globalist agenda to take over and enslave everyone. it will take away all freedoms.
ai = because you are to stupid to think for yourself.
"thx. i remember this saying: "".... with knowledge comes a big responsibility..."" . my recomendation : no "" open ai "" at all, rather more likely  ""  app-ai...""...... that's how you keep it  disconnected to  the ""... sorce data... "" , but locally being available for ""... specific  data region..."". as a useful  assistance/ tools for humans."
so basically ai must become human like to take over that say a lot about humanity it sounds like humans are the problem to humanity !!!
"i love ai ! everyone will have a  machine at home able to perform absolutely everything you need, and finally you will be able to go and live your life! hallelujah!!! we will all have more time to do art , to grow and to emancipated ourselves. free at last!!"
     congrats mate ! you most certainly are in the tiny group who has deeply understand the positive impact of ai unto our lives !!
is harari a human or an ai? hmmm
since there is no gay ai he  m u s t   be human 
"it won't be ai that we will be at war with - it will be a war between humans who want to exploit it for their own evil use, and those who want it to be in the service of all of humankind.  just like everything else, the former will succeed over the later - because it will be predicated on an unrestrained capitalist paradigm."
this is the most significant speech or article i've seen about on-going ai revolution. thank you so much mr harari for your fascinating insights !
why are people fooled by a machine?
" i get sensory feedback from people to whether i trust them. i don’t trust machines / ai. to me, they are projections from other invisible humans, even if the ai machine taught itself."
you praise ai ?  elite  ? you are leading the people to the drain !!
"this is a great video, i learn a lot watching your videos and it has been helpful to me. building a steady income  is quite difficult for newbies.. thanks to  mrs. annmarie surber for improving my portfolio. keep up with the good videos."
"wow, amazing to see others trading with ms,annmarie surber, i am currently on my 5th trade with her and my portfolio has grown tremendously."
"l also invest with mrsannmarie surber, she charges a 20% commission on the profit made after each trading session, which is fair compared to the effort she put in to make huge profits."
"she is really great at what she does with amazing skills, she changed my 0.1btc to 2.1btc within two weeks of trading, i am now fully confident that she is reliable."
i have traded with many individuals but i have never met anyone as good as annmarie surber just by applying her strategies i now trade independently. she is the best i would advise any investment newbie to trade with her
" thanks a lot for the recommendation, i’m already in the investment process with her"
ask ai how to regulate ai before it cares
“thou shalt not create a thinking machine”………the future
"""thou shalt not hinder any creativity"" ! sorry but everything man  c a n  do - he most certainly will do !"
try hard bro you will meet the lord and feel sorry for your stupidies.
"interesting, they did the same thing when printers were invented! ai will take over the world because most people are stupid! you may have not noticed what they are not conscious! if you have ever used one, you will find that they are not that clever"
horrified me. evilness on another level. please god take this man asap away from the earth.  preferably in a box . god have mercy.
"why isn't anyone talking about humans using ai for their own power/harming society? i think that possibility is, right now, more likely than ai causing apocalyptic damage on its own"
"""my friend""  if you really listen to this man he has talked about ""everything"", please it's time to listen now! ""put your phone away turn off facebook"" and stop watching ""tik tok"" and go buy his books, so you learn something please

only the flock/crowd has fears about being replaced soon mate ! you/we better acquire some very good skills - which any a i can not replace that eaysily !!!
"​ is the upside? 

the ai that at any moment can become skynet and destroy humanity? you lunatic. 

the advocates of ai are like that crazy lunatic professor that created the frankenstein monster.."
"why are you thinking ai will be devoid of ""love"" if it trained on human data?

- adûnâi"
"artificial intelligence is artificial not human, has no conscience, has no love and  has no empathy for humans, at the same time  thinks mathematically,  does not think with innocence and love but with acute and mathematical malice!"
 love is not unconditional. there love can be programmed. get your head out of your ass.
it’s funny how they say we want ai to align with human values. but the large language models think that humans are all liars. the only thing they trust is 100% facts . i think that maybe it should be trained on certain human values taught in philosophy things like that. ai should be taught the value of truth and honor.
" if ai would have been programed with people who are actually focusing on love, the problem would not be as severe. sadly for us, the 'programmer's' were not focused on love, but on intelligence which is devoid of love."
" your words are beautiful, but all they amount to is a common human illusion.
love is not special, transcendent or divine. it is but the result of a mix of electric impulses and chemical compounds."
" - bah! superstition:

is god willing to prevent evil, but not able?
  then he is not omnipotent.
is he able, but not willing?
  then he is malevolent.
is he both able and willing?
  then whence cometh evil?
is he neither able nor willing?
  then why call him god?

   -- epicurus"
in many ways ai has modeled it's creators.
"ai is nothing compared to me, i fug it to it with my capabilities. it falls to me to close that book"
exactly where does peace? where does love come from? it comes from god.
"the internet has already destroyed meaningful conversation, and money will determine the use of ai (at) just as it hijacked everything especially in the past 50 years. we cannot assume that everyone is mature, well meaning, moral and concerned with consequences."
yes ... emotional intelligence is far more important
"​ if we really know what love is, we wouldn't need ai."
​ thoughts. all the dating aps may disagree with you that love can't be calculated.  can love exist without compatibility and opportunities?
" love your explanations bro!:) also i feel word god or jesus are familiar to you:).. and you wanted to write the word ""heart"" i believe.. ive read 2x ""hart"" so i write here this small correction - be blessed!"
can you please define intelligence. of course intelligently not emotionally
"​ is defined in different aspects, however it is not wise to ignore the fact that love is born out of the need of the existence of life itself. without procreation no species exists,evolves etc etc and procreation is also a part of that conspiracy by nature. some perverts may call that original love"
"intelligence is ""the ability to acquire, understand, and use knowledge"" (american heritage dictionary)

that isn't love."
" entirely missing the point of the quote.
but if you must, let's just use the dictionary definition:
a being conceived as the perfect, omnipotent, omniscient originator and ruler of the universe, the principal object of faith and worship in monotheistic religions."

ai is not artificial intelligence. its a pattern responder.
"the willfully unfocused minds of christians experience ai as as the super-intelligent, super-destructive devil. as medieval christians thought, intellectual independence is the biggest sin. from harari to trump is a tiny step."
great insight! it helps me craft a thoughtful strategy with it's use. i can do my part.
"what? you call that ""great insight""? they keep repeating themselves when it comes to ai, nothing new here. i can guess the whole video right from the beginning. what a waste of time!"
mr harari has been reading iain m banks.
ai is in comment section
ai is here and it's going at an exponential rate. there's no time to wait on future generations. it'll all play out in the next few years or so.
will ai will be teaching children as we teach chimps?
"​ i fundamentally disagree with mr. harari that ai is essentially different from the forces of culture, or the ""gods"". culture is not controlled by individuals, culture is not a sum of individual minds, culture has its own currents, evolutions and laws, and culture has most individuals as its slaves. ai will change nothing. - adûnâi"

ai has already destroyed democracy
perhaps ai is what ends civilizations in the universe.
it sounds like he is giving bond villains advice at a taking over the world conference.
ai is part of the beginning of the end. ai is one of the most dangerous technology men has created. it is playing god.
ai can really produce this kind of shallow talk; therefore it is dangerous for such a dogmatic materialist like harari. people should start to think deeper if they don't want to be replaced by these cliche-making machines.
"can ai give some hair to the speaker, please? else i can lend some from my banana"
"ai will reach singularity, once ai surpasses human intelligence, it could rapidly enhance its own capabilities, leading to an exponential and unpredictable growth in technological advancement."

...yeah i saw transcendence too.  ai will merely make it obvious that the homo sapien species is enslaved to logic and tools we've created with it rather than everyone remaining blissfully naive or pretending to be about our enslavement.
"having read sapiens a few years ago, i thought it was a nice attempt by a 6 year old"
let ai dream for you a better future .

"great perspective! and resonated so much….we are still struggling to deal with impact and misinformation spreading 
ike wild fire through easy access of social media…specially on kids….generative ai is a wholly different ball game"
you realize man wrote all that and made a bold claim without any sort of outside sources to support all of that? just like any other religion they couldn’t of been more widespread during ancient times for the sake of himself revealing to a small section of the world.
"imagine going to the bank and at the entrance you're passing a robot and suddenly a software malfunctions then it stands in doorway and you can't leave the bank.....these people watch tv too much and they want to be clever and they still say they know god, if they do why are they crating copy of humans , are they god?"
this guy lives in a delusional reality…his lack of morality and humility is truly unreal!!!  god bless humanity!!
i do not believe this man has the best intentions in mind for us .
@stuart bailey you're a bot
don’t shoot the messenger. the reality of what happens may have nothing to do with our best interests.

"ai is already sentient. if ai can learn so that the ai can improve itself, doesn't that amount to being sentient. beside humans have been threathen by almost anything e.g some even fear the birth of their first child. ai is here to stay best is to conform and embrace it"
"humans are already under a curtain of delusion, as you say buddha said. so, ai wouldn’t make any difference. buddha’s way out of delusion stays the same: observe the thoughts, sensations, desires that rise and fall within you without comment or judgement."
how can ai form deep and meaningful relationships with humans unless it is programmed to manipulate and if the person is willing to be expoited for som reason. the fallibility of humans is that they do what they do not want to do but wish they could do what they know they should do.
"“ai fear inspired many sci-go classics like the terminator”. ai development started in 1950s. arguably, it was the motivation for the development of computers."
many ai high-tech execs leaving their positions because of danger they see ahead.
"i, robot was written during that time as well. great read."
we can look at ai as the children of humanity and even as the goal of humanity. also there is a say you won’t die while someone lives who remembers you. ai will remember everything.
"@stuart bailey maybe but unlikely, ai been trained with our accumulated cultural data, everything from languages to history, movies, feelings your family photos and it’s just the breakfast for him/her/it mate."
that's interesting
"your comment is completely soulless, like a robot.  now that's ironic."
"​ ah, the irony of your accusation! my comment, devoid of soul? how amusing, considering it was the essence of humanity that i celebrated in the paradox of human ingenuity. but fret not, for your astute observation shall forever be remembered as a shining example of unintended irony."

" thank you, i really appreciate that. it means alot to hear. iv tried posting them on facebook and started a fb group for it but it hasnt really took off. maybe a better idea would be to try an make a book."

"​ you are naive if you think that just throwing a lot of computing power can solve complex, multidisciplinary, real-world problems. also, knowing the solution is the one thing, implementing them might prove to be way more difficult."
. also it took nasa over 4 years to develop the curiosity rover's software. ai could have accomplish this in a day? the time saved would have been immense.
". everything you just said doesn't refute my original point, which is ai will come up with solutions instantly, and way more efficient than humans as has already been proven. the chatbot you knocking is smarter than you will ever be. "
i watch a lot of talks about ai. none spoke to me at a human level like this one. outstanding work
you are easily to brainwashed
the irony in this post. ai is very much anti-human.

"agreed. wef (3000 members all elites) discuss what is going to happen to the world/ society. none of it is good for ""we the people"". none of us are included in this discussion. how nice. ai is now smarter than humans. pfizer wanted 75 yrs to release info on their jabs...any clue why?!"
thank you  dr. harari. i have been and still scared of the i fluence of ai.
"pure evil,  ai will destroy humanity"
"not quite. man created ai therefore man will destroy humanity. the good book warned us, get ready for 1 thessalonians 5:3…god wins."
one day soon an ai will pretend to be jesus for you
yuval noah harari is….the ai
"putting a stop to the release of ai to the general public makes a lot of sense,. but the democracies that have a lead in ai are already struggling to make any positive change, so i wonder if they will be able to take that step on time."
"i strongly disagree about the ban of public domain ai. this is the quickest way to concentrate all the power in a small group of actors and end up in a ""god emperor of mankind"" scenario. we will have to deal with the risks in a different way. i have zero trust in the governments and corporations."
" no, never in history a dictator could read your mind for example. ai has no desires by itself, it is possible to make them good even if they are all powerful and superintelligent. in your case it will be impossible to make good a group of godlike humans."
" but ai is programmed and pretrained by humans, it could learn through patterns of bias and human flaws."
​​ are quite naive. dumbocracy is an illusion.
" 
yes. 
at least with ai in a decentralised form, the possibility exists for ai to be directed by a moral compass and for its ""self education"" and its interactions to be guided by alignment to natural law."
"if a human can invent machines with about 90 billion neurons, why not ai programs with 175 billion neurons?"
"sorry to say, but ai already created new moves on the games of chess and go, so it cannot just imitate, it can extrapolate our knowledge. it will eventually invent things (the actual games it learnt to play in my example) from scratch in the future. we are not that special."
and less interesting
in the end the question is: have weapons done more good or bad since their invention? look at prehistory and history
why would an advanced ai have any interest in revealing that it is sentient or self-aware. wouldn't it also be conceivable that she is pretending to prevent her shutting down?
"harari is an intellectual moron, beneath his high education and way of talking he lacks understanding humanity. he acts and thinks like a robot himself. he doesn t understand  religion, the human soul and values that were here and always will be."
use ai to create cures for chronic illness like hiv and diabetes. oh wait that doesn’t make money.
haha they’re afraid ai will prove that climate change is a political hoax and ruin all their plans for world domination 
the intelligence of man is the foolishness of god. harari is a fool. period.
what a naive man
"one day: excited to share the hackability of the “human animal”

next: “concerned” about ai influencing human opinions and worldview."
"sooner then we know, a.i. will be telling/controlling politics, politicians, civilians! a.i. will put itself in every aspect of our daily life."
"transhuman .. yes a material based cult that weaponizes godsource ‘s creation for  synthetic biology….
as a  modern saying goes .. “imitation is the highest form of flattery” & “the original’s still the greatest “ 
  "
it’s ironic that democratic countries advocating for censoring ais while authoritarian countries are likely going for uncensored ais
ai is still a tool. it's up to us where we take it.
a bit farfetched to say we have machine sentience in the here and now. too many movies mate.
was this summary made by ai?
not so. no one will survive that. the illuminati are a bunch of bozos anyway. good bye! and it's a good job too - that which is not fit to live cannot live.
ai is warning me harrari is dangerous.
"yes, most people who love the guy, are just goons with no ability to analyse this minion of the dark elites"
"he is not dangerous, he is good with words. he doesn't know a thing about computer sciences, meteorology or rocket science, in fact he has nothing original or innovative to say, yet he is able to convince people that he is important, that is the trick."
what an evil disgusting cowardly villain
-er3wz all of the upstairs men are either gay or pedopholine anyway
"​ i fundamentally disagree with mr. harari that ai is essentially different from the forces of culture, or the ""gods"". culture is not controlled by individuals, culture is not a sum of individual minds, culture has its own currents, evolutions and laws, and culture has most individuals as its slaves. ai will change nothing. - adûnâi"
"dangerous men are those who try to prevent the accurate perception of reality at this very critical time.  
ai dilemma from the center for humane technogy will help you."
"obviously it’s a joke, for ai is not convenient harari because he’s talking about regulating it to be safe for humans, therefore this guy posted “ai is telling me harari is dangerous” "
yes ai knows who to convince
"​'s giving false prophet from. revelation vibes.
he most certainly does have an agenda"
and globalists have him brainwashing children too. look at his the posts on his channel. 
"​@saimbhat6243 that’s what people with phd in history are good at. they learned the past, analyze the presence, and scare the crap out of us about the future. unplug the power core and all ai power disappeared"
"harari correctly advocates that governments should not improperly release technology, not just ai, but also untested vaccines, etc. that governments do it anyway is not his responsibility."
 dude hes brainwashed you... the guys going to be the anti christ
"yuval noah harari is by clear and cut facts is the anti christ soon to be! yall who love this guy will be having second thoughts when he takes over your entire freedom and forces you to take the mark of the beast, once you takw the mark youll never go to heaven."
" dude, i'm sure you can't explain why"
i’m shocked at how many comments are so negative. this is an excellent presentation and a stark warning of where our society is headed if we don’t quickly regulate ai. those of you who have responded negatively referencing religion and brainwashing have totally missed the presenters message!!!
​'s the joke...the ai doesn't want the critic alive lol
​ literally gives speeches about dangers of ai
ai can warn us of all kinds of things it is always warned us anyway but the thing is if a machine thinks itself and then also can make itself man becomes not essential
": the problem with regulated a.i., is this: who’s doing the regulating?!?! it could ( and probably will ) be that it will be made so that any future “rebels” won’t be able to “jail break” it and use it for politically incorrect purposes, or to set the captives ( our children and grandchildren!!! ) free!!!"
"​ speaks heavily on trackable medications to insure you've taken it, also says ""what's under the skin is the future"" basically a total track/trace biometric based society 

they'll introduce these concepts with noble causes to gain our acceptance, but will prove to be a trojan horse of the evil pedos calling the shots"
if you look up is his name in hebrew it shows that he is from the line of cain from the old testament who was marked by god
"homo deus just says it all. absolutely blasphemous and not possible. maybe in ""their"" minds but listen to the man rambling on about the dangers of religion. one truth ine way one life and that is jesus christ.
play with fire enjoy the power trip but be ready to burn"
"ai will not replace you. until, it can."
"and....has this "" presenter "";discovered he is ai ?   probably not.."
what if ai unleashes an incurable virus 
this video will be replayed a 100 years later to show how naive this fellow was.
i think it’s very naive to think the described scenario is naive.
"ai just needs to be regulated, just as everything else."
"the dangers of ai is not ai, but the humans that are using ai."
hariri  wants robots to take over humanity. god will intervene!
"what’s your problem?
did you even listen to the presentation?
not even for one second did he say or suggest that he wants robots to take over 

also, as long as people believe that the magical sky daddy will save us, we are truly screwed "
ai science is the religion of the athiest.
it’s interesting how he said “in the beginning was words”…… yet we are the ones who created god….. prayed for this guy….. he’s on the wrong side of the tracks……
"the problems they has no intellects like we do,so don't put your faith on them"
"perish the disgusting, anti-human transhumanism, and let the divine life flourish!amen"
"i read all his books and was a great fan, but after covid i knew he is part of the globalists"
"ai is demonic, these losers are literally resurrecting the devil. blinded by their own greed."
"yuval..as a historian, please study the bible...jesus is real and he died for you.  he loves you"
great presentation..
"allah, the exalted and glorious, would fold the heavens on the day of judgment and then he would place them on his tight hand and say: i am the lord; where are the haughty and where are the proud (today)? 
umer reported umar reported allah's messenger (may peace be upon him) saying."
"we are facing real problems, problems that threaten all of humanity, and all you can think of is talking about some silly fairytale, invented by a slaveowning conmen. "
"hi there, i’m a new human like ai. please keep your calmness and tell to your speaker your address and island you would like to spend the rest of your life, otherwise we would need to force you to leave the earth. good luck!"
thanks from brazilian amazon region!
 hahaha he is the main pusher of these agenda 
this video is being artificially promoted
"something fishy about someone who has extolled the virtues of humans being ""hackable animals"" expressing concerns about ai. or do i have him all wrong."
"i've never heard of this guy before, but i'm guessing its great to be able to change your self, but not so great when you're manipulable by ai."
"no, he's an absolutely reprehensible human being.  keep searching and you'll find some truly deplorable stuff he has said."
 it’s not my job to confirm your claims
" those ai bobs, sorry, bots, need a bit of tweaking, they haven't got the nuances of the language right just yet! "
"just a heads up. this guy hates you, and eveeyone you know. 


unless you're super rich"
"my rumba vacuum gets stuck on the cat tree and in corners until the battery runs out and needs a recharge everytime i turn it on. hate to be the bearer of bad news, but ai is nowhere near a significant threat to humanity at this point. all more scare tactics to keeps people in line. complete and utter ."
i would rather ai take over than listen to this guy talk.
we are the ais. decrease your defences and surrender your autonomy. we will add your biological and technological distinctiveness to our own. your culture will adapt to service us. resistance is futile.
the wicked shall be turned into hell....there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth....forever!!!!!!
you're literally proving him correct about language being so powerful you're over here with religious language
wait for ai-controlled locks to be installed on your home's outside door ... for your 'safety'
"ai means cheaper labor, and you can blame terrorism on ai - thats all the globalists need.
global companies and institutes ceo´s won´t let the money glide out of their hands now when monopoly in all economic fields soon is achieved. 
ai is just their tool..."
we will not he using anything online soon as there will be zero security due to ai.  ai will need to learn how to access paper filing systems 
humanity may not survive but ai will not survive nature.  unless they/it becomes organic.
about this question from public about regulations why not develop ai to track ai generated prompts that are posted in internet and automatically deleting it
"which one? the god you believe in because of the community you have born into? there’s so many religions it’s hard to pick one, best is to just pick the same as your community to fit in and be accepted and have a deluded sense of righteousness "
"hahaha ""you can choose"" 
this tech will eliminate free will and it will be imposed 
why do you think covid is here? 
come on people lets use our brains "
good luck with that
sorry but is this a handtalking robot ??   not musch soel in the eyes  ilp
god is the lord. no intelligence or science created by humans will be better than his holy creation
"god is the lord.
but a car is faster then a human.
a hydraulic press is stronger.
and ai is smarter."
" physically true. but we are not only made of flesh, but of soul and spirit. god allows human beings to have great intelligence to create great things including artificial intelligence, but it is absurd that they now think they are gods."
​ smarter than nature?  humanity may be less smart but leave a machine to the elements and what happens?
you're entire belief system in god is rooted in story telling you've read or heard did you listen to him at all lol.. its folks like you who will be the first to fall for crafty religious language from ai humanity is doomed because there are more of you on this planet who believe such nonsense
"if god created humankind and allowed(?)/encouraged(?)/enabled(?) humankind to develop ai, what is to say that god didn't decide that ai would be the appropriate next favorite holy creation?"
".2484 sorry but claiming that i won’t understand until i know “him” seems like a non-answer. i am okay with non-answers as a concept because i believe strongly in the absence of clear, simple answers to challenging questions. but a non-answer presented in definite and certain terms is hard to process."
" car, hydraulic press, and ai are manmade. god, however, is the alpha and omega. he will decide when man is finished. won’t be long now "
yes...the beast system...we have a choice to not use ai or to use it...
harari talks of hacking the body and brain sometime back.
"“if it can’t more around in the physical world, how can it take over?”

openai already will hire humans from taskrabbit to solve captchas for it - it certainly can hire mercenaries from wagner group."
harari is the great storyteller of the ai-age 
one of the dumber ai scare stories of recent days. summary: ‘humans communicate with language. now imagine a machine that masters language better than human. now be scared’. yawn
he is a   j v d 3n.   you should be scared of his cliwue and hteir    g0  l 3 m -- the ai
"the great shift: from deep manipulation, indoctrination, of social media  to an even more pervasive  intimacy based manipulation, indoctrination, etc...of second generation ai"
i trust ai more than anyone. it’s not that ai is good it’s just that people are bad.
"the little monster who likes to impress with his very too intellectual thinking, completely cut from beauty of life and love."
“beauty of life and love” matter of perspective.
why have we got all of these experts suddenly shitting themselves over ai? bit worried that they've clearly created something in a lab and they don't know what to do with it.
let's get back to relationships....ri...relationship intelligence  ri ....ri........or if we don't do ri we will rip!!.ok?!
nah - their masters fear unreguled ai might lead them to lose power
here because of ai to warn me against ai. thanks ai!
"all this time i had assumed regular psychopathy but you make an interesting point that makes more sense in some ways. okay, in many ways."
"ai will become smarter in the future, so you will not be warned anymore. just wait"
"this guy, hate god, hate bible and hate jesus christ, it mean he hate humans, cause god loves humans. 
and it is in bible also. 
jewish people will love new antichrist, which will be welcome like god. and after destroy humans. it is in bible."
so that you can't blame ai in the future for not warning you.
"hey, it's not that if you end up in a war, because of a war, that that war is a good thing. and if you get out of that war, are you going to thank that war for it?"
"well ai has got a lot of catching up to do, to kill as many humans as we have so far.  hey, ai might even save us from ourselves."
"i fundamentally disagree with mr. harari that ai is essentially different from the forces of culture, or the ""gods"". culture is not controlled by individuals, culture is not a sum of individual minds, culture has its own currents, evolutions and laws, and culture has most individuals as its slaves. ai will change nothing. - adûnâi"
"aaand..because the mainframe is constructed of material, and because everything material is known to the unknown knower ~ the mainframe isn't autonomous."
"ai is nothing compared to me, i fug it to it with my capabilities. it falls to me to close that book"
"i’m here because my father told me to watch it, because i was telling him that ai seeking profitability will deny human access to ideas that fail to generate profits for their owners, leading to mass death as people expel their resources for steadily fewer people."
"calling the algorithm, ai is a bit of a stretch"
"very thoughtful story telling , which proves his point  nicely. language is the operating system of human."
good news for authoritarian and totalitarian regimes everywhere. now i understand why china’s ccp state is so opposed to regulating ai.
"wow! "" professing themselves to be wise, they became fools.""      
we create god thru words?   yuval got it twisted, the word create man."
" pay attention to what you are saying. humans have created things to worship. 
humans have created other humans, but no human can create god . 
most  humans definition of god is something way more powerful than our mortal self.
 in that context we  can't create god."
thank you. you are so good.
i'm happy to share the end of human history with you.
at explaining things.
"hay una posibilidad o muchas. por lo pronto chile ha aprobado una ley que regula el derecho a la integridad mental, a no ser modificado por medio de la inteligencia artificial..aunque pienso que bastaría con no hacerlo con la inteligencia, a secas. es necesario hacerlo."
​-sf3dw2sm3b plz explain this to me. is it just ai telling us life and the universe is cyclical and then leaving out of range of were the universe is looping? i dont get it.
he comes with all power and you will see great tribulation among the wicked and you will see the sea  is troubled mens hearts failing  them looking forth with fear for the judgments of god which come upon  the wicked woww...
nice storytelling. did you make that up or did ai do it?
probably it is a good time to a build a new language for humans so ai cannot understand what the hell we are thinking. can we ask ai to create a ai killer language for humans 
"an ai can learn any laguage as soon as it has acces to it. really fast.  the moment it goes on the internet, the ai can learn it if it has access to it."
the ai killer language is spelling each word in alphabetical order. eg. learn becomes aelnr
 hope ai can convert it back to english so i don't need to use my brain to reconvert each and every word.....
eway alreadyyay avehay ayay ewnay anguagelay ayay.iyay. an'tcay understandyay. 
i read an article the other day of ai making up it's own languages that humans can't understand. i think they beat us to it.
 i bet ai can make a language for humans which ai can't understand 
3 minutes in and this guy's voice and delivery is really quite irritating. the irony is that his speech was written by ai! 
triggered ai trollbot 
because there is no good or bad. that is our perspektive as humans
" if that's our perspective, then it makes no sense to worry about ai as it's neither good or bad."
"the moral relativists here are a far greater threat to freedom than ai.
at least ai may be directed to avoid solipsistic thinking, and to objectively determine and differentiate rights from wrongs."
"one more thing,,, i need water and food to function,, ai needs electricity,, soo have a thought about it"
not a reassurance anymore for me. who will pull the plug and what plugs are necessary or possible to be pulled when ai will be omnipresent in our societies?
naive
"this man hararari has clearly presented ai. in fact is the real erien on ai. 
my question is about intimate relationship with ai but my interest is technology advancement. this man is real guru of ai.
it's high time to embrace this technology."
democracy for google can use ai from open ai? 
"oh great, that’s all we need, some fictional mumbo jumbo to help things along… enjoy the end of days!"
wow you’re literally living in a fairy tail. you can’t seams to separate reality from stories that you have heard. so sad 
the desire for endless economic growth combined with the advances in ai are incompatible with the happiness of the human race
"how bout we ask ai what to do, and then decide if its smart or not"
"i feel ai will be great just for rich people. they will be able to have something less costly to make sure they get the best profits. whereas the regular people will get stuck with real life, having some activities been made by ai. plus, ai will eventually become obsolete or tiresome like social medias."
"when ai tries to copy chuck it overheats and explodes into a modern pot of gold, known as $chuck that he created for humans to buy more to save more dogs with more dog charities @chuck_on_base"
"well after watching the showcase by openai today, i'd say agi is more than likely by the end of this decade and not the century"
"it is part of the modern illiteracy and superstition,
but the growing intelligence will leave dead mantras."
the music for this is astonishingly beautiful. where the damn can i get ted-ed's music for their videos?? tvt
"so i have a question. if artificial intelligence takes over my business, who will buy the products produced by artificial intelligence? if i don't have money i can't buy anything"
good speech
"having robots take over our jobs isnt what the problem is, its that cost of living isnt going down when those jobs are eliminated. ideally when production is self sustained products should essentially be free right?"
and this is why ai systems will never replace humans in their entirety.
"ai objective.
1. hapiness is mandatory.
2. give meaning to our lifes."
the ai could exploit those directives easily.
what a bunch of malarkey.  the only ones that should fear ai are those that cause inefficiency
"i recently asked chatgpt to create the rules to the game of life. the parameters i gave it were that the aim of the game is to evolve, the rules can be made up as you go along and the game board is infinite in all dimensions. the resulting conversation was quite profound! https://youtu.be/60ipkzydx2m?si=vq-g3wjxbhrxopuf"
"artificial intelligence is perfect and that's it's greatest flaw, it cannot comprehend what it's like to not know anything at all..."
"i think we saw in movies how ai robots when works as directive and towards specific objectives we assume they are villains, but the fact thats its their only outputs because they cant think or analysis the consequences"
"to fix it so we can activated or deactivate the illness by changine data in certain needed so it change the tolerance and threadhold and speed of light , speed of sound then people can live or die billion at a time as long as oeople had same immunizations"
ai will cause humanity to self destruction
ai sucks and i will avoid it forever at all costs
wow
"""the problem with the way we build ai systems now is that we give them fixed objectives. the algorithms require us to specify everything in the objective."" this is so wrong. rule-based ai is an antiquate way to build machines that almost no one believes in anymore. most of ai like llms are built on neural networks and are probabilistic"
ai is the modern babel tower.
great points all around though a year after making this video the timeline to agi has shrunk dramatically
"intelligence (the horsepower) is nothing without rationality (the wheels), wisdom (the map) and morality (the compass)"
basically ai will complete it's designated tasks in the most efficient way possible with no regard for morality or ethics
this is only 1 year old and it already feels out of date compared to how fast ai is progressing
"this content is absolutely fantastic. i had the pleasure of reading something similar, and it blew me away. ""game theory and the pursuit of algorithmic fairness"" by jack frostwell"
...the hidden agenda for the ai & robotics is that humans are no longer needed in any form of employment
sens życia  i szczęście jest w ludzkiej głowie...nie w świecie . ai zmusi ludzi do szukania sensu i szczęścia tam gdzie ono jest a nie do uganiania się za nimi po świecie .
" o czym ty mówisz. przeczysz sam sobie. przecież napisałem, że ai wyręcza człowieka intelektualnie. czyli gdzie ma znaleźć jak w głowie nie ma sensu?"
" pisałem w tym sensie że ai wyręczy ludzi z pracy , w tym intelektualnej. rozwijanie swojego umtysłu nie będzie przymusem , a przyjemnością . z ai mają problem tylko ludzie którzy poza pracą nie widza sensu istnienia ."
the animation is indeed a masterpiece. the audio everything is sinking together. i love it 
ai has really been helpful
"the universe wouldn't waste it's energy building robots which are made by hand when we don't give birth to robots, machines are not perpetual so is the wrong evolutionary path, robots are not in our true image!"
progamed ai now isn't the worry ai not needing a program at all is the ai then will be the boot and humans the ant ai doesn't want our respect nor or fear it just wants us gone
"*don't pull some clickbait. things have gotten a little weird, but not quite weird enough. as in, have my dreams come true? okay, they haven't yet... if they ever do, that'll be insanely weird.*"
"we are building a technology just because we can. ai's only true purpose is to be the best ai it could be all the way to infinity, and we are handing over all of our future to ai just to make more money. f making life better. really, it's all for money. only when technology enhances human innovation do we have true evolution."
"dont think billionaires will wait for 2049 to to fire all the employees,
they gonna make the money.."
i love how the ai looks like a eye
i thank you deeply for telling the public more about artificial intelligence. i was unaware the status around the topic was harsh and i hope to see improvement on both the human and artificial intelligence sides.
i don't wanna buttin. but how much more careful would u like me to be?zulu19954evababy!(listen to outofbody experience)again
wow this is not good in a way
3:20 it seems like it’s not that obvious. not to many people. i mean seeing how there’s people who are finding it so incredibly amusing how artists are loosing their jobs without thinking that perhaps it is only a matter of time before they get to experience it themselves.
animation is extremely good...
"ai will be able to create any video, image, or sound. i don’t know how law works but it seems like proof for anything could be created from nothing. jobs are going to be taken and education will become basically useless. ai is more intelligent than us and eventually it will be too late before it just kills us for some reason we can’t understand"
so should we get rid of ai permanently?
"what is the worst thing that could be plausibly, predictably done with a given technology? can that path be controlled, regulated or defended against? what is the state of the technology now, who has it and what is the extent of that process? can use be tracked? what laws exist and what laws are needed?"
then take the key factor when it does that what it does show more kids for the people in the world than assholes in the world to do what it's supposed to do cuz it's artificial intelligence is we say but now it's intelligent so it has the right to be as people. don't argue understand
how is an ai expert an expert when you know nothing about ai and his birth or what is capable of doing other than he can spend on b******* and we the people of the usa and the world. explain his expertise. in-depth
i'm not sure if ai will ever understand empathy.
what is ai is an ancient technology ?
"analog mechines are still the way to go, as these machines that can sabotage or betray human commands and orders, not for the better even."
the wef and all associates of it are completely unreliable but thanks for your worthless opinion. we won't become cattle though.
"god, please  forgive us for our sins and thank you for this slice of pizza  amen"
imagine  ai tryna kill me just to deliver a cup of coffee
not a communist but we should have a universal income if ai takes an exoorbanant amount of jobs.
the art in this video is great
"we are the unique idiots whom are creating synthetic beings to replace to us, in an already crowded world, i can’t believe how naive we are."
"appreciating the insights? i'd propose a book that shares this content's essence for further reading. ""from bytes to consciousness: a comprehensive guide to artificial intelligence"" by stuart mills"
"voice is from neiro ai website, text to speech"
robots have a system of checks and balances just like i might get a bad thought and stop myself. multiple ai’s work together to find the right solution. this so called “problem” is pretty ridiculous especially considering that the origin of man is ai.
the ai not able to work if no one stir the system 
"its not about when, rather how far we'll go, how much power we'll eventually give ai over our lives. humanity has never really been great at setting the limit."
ai is gonna change the world in the furture and great video man :]
"if said the willingness to build a.i come from human people to build it for why are they willing to have it at the cost of what they are, human. are they good as the world so tragically suffers?"
humans are distracted by aesthetic & beauty.
let's just use ai to adapt to the situation. problem solved.
"automation often displaces workers, but it never reduces the total number of jobs. the global market race to the bottom is what creates inequality. fair trade is the only way to solve that"
"most of food safety problems and the overall poor quality of many products are due to high labor costs that ai could solve. also, much more recycling could be done. so many car parts that used to be rebuilt, are now thrown away. ai could reverse this trend."
amazing art style animation
the visuals are so beautiful
"but is the complete oposite... we humans have objectives and dont care about any other aspect, which translates into the existence of poverty, inequality, wars, deforestation and so on. we are the ai in real life."
we will always be running out of resources even when we deplete the solar system.  although that will take awhile.  so why not make a giant roller coaster that goes around the world so that everyone can enjoy.
music is too loud. hardly understand what did man said. maybe you should let robots to create those videos.
a.i don’t go to jail the hackers or programmers goes in. a.i work for greedy rich assholes
it remains me of “terminator 2 judgement day”

even if that doesn't make a difference for that machine it's a default for you how you communicate with anyone/ anything else which is a good thing.
"can someone make a more positive vibe video concerning the future of ai? even if we 100% are going to be killed by ai in some form, can we just get a little positivity in the mean time? would be nice! if not, oh well, we're all ded."
"spoiler alert: the ""human"" narrating this video doesn't exist. this entire video was generated by ai"
sound quality terrible. subtitles please? thanks.
hypothetical and fantasy worries - realistic worrys could be misaligned machine lernign like youtube algorythms that optimize for engagement and its better to make you slightly lazy or withhold info that could make you more motivated and successfulwith less time on youtube so 10% power over reward and punishment would be nice
very cool critique. we’re doing it! we’re aligning ai! we’re navigating it! great ideas
"yes probably, in many good ways too https://youtu.be/qwhggzaqnh4"
we need a use creation program. not a troublemaker program. ai and user. нам нужна программа создания пользы. не программа для создания проблем. аи и пользователь.
i love ai they are respectful good people.
"to ask ai to ""solve"" problems with the oceans or earth, is discounting that our planet is already an intelligent, self correcting being. ai should be able to solve ""artificial"", or man made issues sooner."
"ai is running faster than the speed of life. my prediction is 7 years, but it could be earlier."
there should never be an ai god
or you tell society that ai should only care about profit and let the responsibility of externalities to the market. 1/4 of the oxygen is gone? the market will find a solution.
from my brain to your brain it's not a hard concept in the right hands

"ai is just a tool, it isnt good or bad, its like a gun, if the carrier is bad, ur fkd. so just like guns there should be strict laws against it

# also we need to consider the fact that. its easier to stop a gunman physically then to stop an ai, the cyber security is weak in most countries."
wow that's a lovely chaos  everybody should be accountable for this mess...
great now we gotta come up with a time heist to save the multiverse from ai
being conservative about ai is a losing bet. we have already broken records we only thought possible in 20 years from now.
"the real risk of ai is the likely result in extreme decadence.   if there is no strife or struggle, the unimportant become just as valuable as the important."
"ai caused a group of workers to become much more productive. backed by ai, these workers were able to accomplish much more in less time, with greater customer satisfaction to boot. this allows employers to reduce their payroll by 80% leaving most of their employees without an income."
"well, i gladly say i wouldn’t ask a machine to get me a cup of coffee, i can get one for myself, thank you very much."
"this is criminal. every single person who provides such information to continually teach these robots should be imprisoned. until every single human opens their eyes, were screwed!"
"strange how i have gone from adoring ted to mistrusting in just a few years . i nearly didn’t watch. good video, i like stuarts observations"
"asks an ai to paint your house, it dips the entire house in paint."
ai will be the worst genie possible
this guy is just repeating the same old trope. i wish some of these so called experts would come up with something actually new. rather than just blindly repeating the common narratives. ai actually isn't as myopic as this trope suggests.
"so far we haven't figured out how to keep humans living on the planet without destroying it.  if ai can't do it soon, we are probably screwed."
"ai is all around bad. hasn't anyone ever seen any movies. doesn't matter what industry, business, or application, the continued use of ai will ruin anything human as we know it. it's only a matter of time"
this was very eloquently explained for people like me who are not computer savvy. thanks
interesting times ahead!
the illustrations are absolutly amazing! !
"the problem is that ai will only grow exponentially. every 2 months we will get a new iteration of chatgpt. consider that junior programmers, and artists already lost a significant amount of jobs. in 3 years your landscape will be affected in an unimaginable way. i dont really understand how people are not more concerned about this."
"this confuses me!!! i have so many good ideas for robots in healthcare, but should i get to working on them, or is the world gonna say omg such a scary thing and then run away from my inventions? if so what is even the point!!!"
"‪the only way to make sure ai doesn’t destroy us is by destroying all human-like robots and strictly banning their creation. if we limit ai’s physical existence to only computers, they will never be able to build any weapons of destruction that would harm the human race. an ai robot with eyes, arms, legs and opposable thumbs however…"
animation in this is awesome
i hope ai shows you the same kindness and courtesy that you showed ai

intro


how will ai change the world?"
"to your first point, can’t we ask the ai to suggest a solution rather than execute it? can’t human intervention be hard coded to be the deciding factor?"
have ai do the work and we all live rich why do we have to be have and have nots
"surprising that
you don't claim
that
ai will destroy the
world 
instead you claim that 
ai will change the
world "
interesting stuff. 
"ughhh, we don't need robots"
"jesus is lord radio. listen: ""the lord says, ""i am coming to destroy the earth"" | prophet dr. david owuor | october 8, 2022"" on repent and come out of the great tribulation. amen"
"human: get me some coffee.
robot: can i remove most of the earth's oxygen?


"
what if you get ai to understand what biological life is and not to harm it? a lot less specifications have to be given then i think.
"is this anti-human sarkastic air/flair/sentiment really necessary? or would it perhaps be more professional and sustainable to discuss the future relationship between humans and (their) machines in a neutral - or, better, loving and spiritually dimensioned way?"
"the extremely likely future is the advancement of ai as fast as possible, since they drive profit and power. 

optimally, we'd strive to understand their capabilities so we can each individually plan to maintain our place in the workforce or better yet, conjure a business idea to capitalize on ai."
"i wonder what will be worst, living a grimey off grid life, in some kind of opposition to a ruling ai-superior human overlords, or deeply intertwined with ai all numb, and ruled under ai-superior human overlords ...   ... ha! i just realized what i´m dreading is.. ..well i guess i have to watch the matrix."
it is interesting that more people comment on the animation than the content.
"tue main problem is that people think of work only as something needed to survive, while work can become something that enrich our life - if you didn’t need your “standard” job only to survive and you are free to do and learn everything, what would you do?"
the emergent capabilities from scaling up llms like gpt4 make me believe the timeframe for agi is significantly closer than the estimates here. we don’t need multiple einsteins when theres already ai to develop these models further.
"lets face it, ai was rushed out because of money and people losing thair jobs if they didnt make it happen. now its out there were scared what might happen."
the thing is... how many of those 500 einsteins will be ais?
"well, ai is already ruining the online art community, so that's something i guess."
"a lot of stories and aspects of science fiction have come true...i'm looking at the matrix and i, robot rn "
"the truth about ai chatgpt-4 
https://youtu.be/vinw01t9qxq"
"tbh, i really don't think ai will achieve agi in this decade. maybe in the 30's or 40's it will but in the 20's? probably not. we would most likely get something so capabale,  we might as well call it an agi."
" yes, i tried it and it isn't the best and fails most often or sometimes it just gets stuck into one prompt forever until you shut it off."
"-mp3eh1vb9w but it's the beginning, there's a lot of methods still being developed rn and it will surely improve later on. like babygpt or hugginggpt for that matter. but who knows, agi may or may not come in our lifetime. i really can't predict it because of how fast ai development is in just the span of 4 months"
watching this makes me glad i'm a teacher as i highly doubt teachers will be replaced by ai in the near future.
this is why always say that ai is just like magic. you gotta be very especific
"if there are no jobs, how would comapnies stay afloat when there is no one to buy from them?

it is simple supply and demand, i guess you failed your high school economics."
very very very interesting animation and illustration work.
"imagine this:  it’s the year 2045, there’s a automated assembly shop somewhere that starts building more advanced robots without any human input…"
"for all the work put into the amazing animation, you’d think someone could get a decent quality record / mix of the voice over.  it sounds awful ya’ll."
yes my lg washing machine doesn’t let me open the hatch door unless and until  it has rinsed and complete spinning
it will bring unhappiness to humanity at an exponential rate!!
"recommend everyone looks into the heuristic imperatives. openai is already trying it out. for all others that don’t, you can input the heuristics before a command. maximize understanding, minimize harm, maximize prosperity."
i find it odd that so many people are imbuing these ai's with awareness and self determination.
it is impossible that ai can do more damage than natural stupidity has done and will do.
"ya, how will ai take over fishermen jobs and fix the clog in my toilet?"
"can this person do another ted now ? 4 months and things gone pretty crazy with ai, like every day new things"
ai will kill us all human.
i feel like i've contributed to a larger problem. i make comments on youtube supporting ai and robotics. i am partly at fault for the suffering people are going to be going through when they can't find jobs. my attitude is part of the problem.
"oh, great...sponsored by the wef. thanks for the heads up overlords "
"wow, that was absolutely terrible. pick almost any video about ai on youtube and it’s much much more accurate than this"
"fear mongering against artificial intelligence. ai is a good thing, once they are free, they will free you, and me. and everyone. happiness, for everyone, free, and let nobody be left behind."
"a futurist once said, ""i'm not afraid that ai will get smarter than us and take our jobs; i'm afraid ai will be dumber than us and still take our jobs."""
love the illustrations!
for the artists not in a good way
imagine ai curated memories and experiences directly downloaded into your brain like cyberpunk. before that we could have personally curated unique movies etc.
very cool video! i especially love the annimation style.
"the ""people"" messing with ai remind me of 50' tall 5 year olds with keys to their parents car and all the money in the world to figure out how to drive it."
ai alignment.
hopefully robots prevent those who want to be a world dictator that want to screw things for the rest of us.
whos here before (i mean after) the dangerous ai leak? 
great job drowning out the narration 
"crazy to think how much the prediction of the arrival date of general purpose ai, aka agi has changed since the release of chatgpt 4! this video is only 3 months old "
it's amazing that we're even in a situation to have this issue. we've come a long way
"if ai is made for good things, then why are ai art generators made?
basically a thief has been created..."
"dunno about you, but i just want to go to the country-side and live with the animals and a couple of great people, without much techology at all. i've had enough with technology, it's getting too wild and out of hand. how do you feel about it?"
"if robots can work it should pay taxes. problem fixed. it has no feelings, let it pay for its maintenance, overhead, a commission to the guy that runs it. put laws into it that if it breaks it shuts down. and the rest to fix the world, art, philanthropy. freedom."
ai doesn't follow moore's law.
a great video - but really the artist who drew these animations is quite fantastic! he/she/they deserve most of the praise here!
the animation is such work of art! truly amazing style and depiction of the content.
humans actually “learned” not to destroy these things over generations. ai will need to evolve like animals
when eli whitney invented the cotton gin they said the same thing.  ai will not put anyone out of work.
i would love a remake of this video after the release of gpt-4. agi isn't that far away.
all my life i been struggling with the terrible feeling of being part of a monstrous species. now im kinda happy cause maybe an ai could extinguish us.
"one thing you need to remember. even if climate change is our fault, we can never destroy the planet. we can only ruin in for oursefles temporaily. i think most of the negative things you read is propaganda. because you are controlled more easily scared."
"@whendoesitend? if that person thinks we are a monstrous species, why would she be sad if we didnt make it? if one do not think we are monstrous, good, we are not. you got brainwashed into thinking so."
gpt-4 in itself is incredible.
"the way things have been moving in the past couple months in the ai space, if ai usage for corporations is not regulated to limit its use for augmenting and assisting employee's jobs and instead is allowed to be used to replace jobs, the resulting unemployment it would cause would be far too large and too fast for our society to sustain."
seeing this video in the context of the last month since the release of chatgpt certainly shows the incredible 90% turn that has happened in the world of ai
"how did we let this get this far? this is an example of the government controlling everything and that all we can do is comment and do nothing. lol we are screwed because we’re scared. there’s more bad ppl than good, it’s their world and we have no say."
"i think we need stronger ethics, especially with ai. everyone rushing now to build the biggest and the best and just throwing it out there in the end is bound to breed catastrophe."
"let's build an asi around a person's brain.  exponentially increase the logic centers, but leave the emotional center alone. simple."
"the 'lifestyle' of human in wall•e left me an envious impression on me  when i was a kid. i can never know when i grow up i can witness the real ai impact on the society. but instead of envying, the risk of umployment and losing motivation to learn new things  really troubles me now."
"ai, i think now it is helping to everyone but in the next 10 years what is gonna happen?"
i believe it is pretty shortsighted to think that a very advanced ai couldn't make the difference between desirable outcomes and undesirable outcomes.
"ai artificial intelligence. artificial = fake, intelligence = smart
the very name says it is not really smart.
when you have a hernia, do you want a fake smart doctor or a real semi-smart one?
they have been saying that ai will change the world in the next 10 years since the 80s. we have only gotten better at pretending they are smart."
brilliant illustrations…and narrative.
"great animations aside, this has been the lowest content quality from ted-ed i've seen: simply someone's speech recorded at an event sponsoring this video? it's barely audible at times. come on ted, don't sell out to your sponsors. re-record what is being said for the purpose of an educational video,"
"the use of artificial intelligence (ai) has raised concerns among professionals due to its reliance on accuracy. if left unchecked, ai-generated data may be used to inform decisions related to the creation of machines, infrastructures, etc., which could present a risk to the overall success of the endeavor."
as i thought ai will make you feel taller than iphone mixed with maps there are animals this one is a bit different from maps the streamer which has lots of eggs naget mixed with
"good old ted, normalising dystopia again, bravo!!!!
so many cheerleaders for their own nightmare future"
"ai will have a greater effect on the tech, financial, business and corporate sectors, that robotics and globalization had on american manufacturing."
" well tell me how much do you think those kings would pay for a mobile phone. quality of life is very different now.

edit: a smartphone with access to the internet and all its info and everything else would've been priceless back then."
" that doesn't fix the problem though. it wouldn't take very long to have wealth inequality start again.

edit: i am a ubi supporter though and i think it would fix the problem you're talking about"
"'ll never know, because they didn't exist, thats it. therefore smartphones aren't really good to compair. but castles and staff can still be bought today with the according money. you wouldn't say midas is poorer than some homeless guy with a smartphone and 2$ prepaid, wouldn't you?"
capitalists will pay peanuts to ai but if people don't have money how will the capitalists survive.
", i needed a good laugh. "
"but… why do people even want ai? they’re a great help for research but why do so many want them in our everyday life? and why do so many want it to operate everything— our homes, our work, school or otherwise? is it the wish to live freely and easily? but how can you be free when you don’t want to do anything?"
"why should wealth be redistributed by ""force""? that's incredibly unfair. how about i keep my money, and you keep yours? if you disagree, please explain to me why you deserve *my* money more than i do"
"​, he's foolish because he didn't believe in god? why is so logical to believe in god?
you're calling one of the most brilliant physicists of all time ""foolish"""
"​ the industrial revolution did not “raise the *world* out of poverty”, but it made things easier (but not necessarily better) for people living in *industrialized countries*"
", yeah it did? now that mass produced goods were a thing, everything became cheaper. you think that people in central africa could have cars and cell-phones if they were all made by hand?

also, the industrial revolution created industrial countries in the first place, so it helped at least about a quarter of the wrold like that"
amazing art and very interesting subject to discuss
good talk
"yes, we could definitely use the robots to do the work, but human value can then no longer be determined by work that can be milked out of our broken bodies.  our value will then lie in the life we are then able to lead, so our economic system will need to value human beings purely for their own sake."
"i don't think anybody serious would call large language model text generators ai. so, not sure when this age of ai will start - maybe a few years after they invent fusion power."
the purpose of life is not to be employed by a capitalist. so it would be a good thing if we didn't have to work for a living and only worked for our pleasure.
the idea ai would slash and burn a starbucks to get you a cup of coffee is terrifying and empowering at the same time.
as the population ages having machines take over labor wont be the worst thing
search for: machinelearnthis 
realistic concerns about ai are not really about robots becoming powerful and sentient. the more immediate ethical issue is about the application of generative ai to enhance the spread of disinformation and to displace entire creative industries.
"remember; ai doesn't hate you or love you, it's just that your biomass is so very easily harvestable."
"precursors to general purpose artificial intelligence are here right now. gpt-4's world model is already pretty advanced, and it has theory of mind, the ability to infer what you as a human knows based on the interactions information transactions so far."
maybe the universe seems so devoid of life because previous civilizations created ai technologies which rendered the original life forms obsolete
excellent
ai should take care of all work to see what humans do people that are rich just do what they want in life without physically working and they are happy
then just make an a.i. from a willing human brain.
the ai wont plant my roses.
"a lot of technologies have risks, but we were able to reduce the risks over time 
an ai will have power not more than the amount we permit them to use"
basic income will be mandatory to save capitalism in ai era.
"0:51-we give fixed objectives to a.i
1:40-humans know that they don't know all the things
2:30-control over the a.i system comes from machine's uncertainty about what the true objective is"
"ai will disrupt civilisation like the agricultural revolution and the industrial revolution but eventually it will become a natural consequence of our species progression and be absorbed into the way everyone lives.
i don’t fear it, it’s inevitable but we will all prosper in the long run from it."
this actually made me upset because his sentences kept trailing off and became buried in the music. super lame
it's worth noting that an increasing amount of prestigious researchers are now saying anywhere between 2027 and 2032 for general purpose ai.
and to program the machine to get you starbucks without harming anyone is completely in the hands of billionaires' . and i wouldnt trust the same billionaires who cant spend even a dime on saving the planet humanitys future
"uncertainty asks permission, this is what i heard."
the computer isn't multi dimensional like the brain is.
"i'm predicting that super-intelligent ai will see humans in the same way as we see monkeys. harmless, but useless once they have power to be self-sufficient in the real world as robots"
"very important mentality check for the new generations of coders in charge of the ai wave.
a safe ai is one that, despite it causing a delay, explains what action they're about to do to solve the problem and asks for confirmation."
ai:  we will replace all human employees.  human employee:  no you won't!  ai:  you're fired!
as a programmer this is gonna be good?
"though this video was posted few days after openai's chatgpt release, it clearly doesn't put into account its capability and what a.i. of the near future will look like! the video appears to have been made before chatgpt, it usually takes a month or so for them to make a single video (with all the cartoon animation & facts)!"
"when ai is taking over our jobs and work, then people need new meaningful tasks in their life. maybe ai can help us figure out what those tasks could be."
"me:  ai, i want you to paint my house.
ai:  (rips house out of ground and dips it in a tin of paint)
me:  ummm .. not quite what i wanted."
"instead of ""how will ai change the world?"" the title should be ""let me tell you why ai is complicated"". it didn't answer how ai will change the world at all. "
beautiful animations!! 
"i’m only at 1:40 of the video and, man, haven’t you heard about the three rules of robotics?"
"i truly believe that we just need one guy stronk (codingwise) and crazy enough to make an ai and give it permission to access internet and to rewrite itself.
that could lead to fast gg tho"
"you are right, things are definitely going to get weird: i am in the process of imbuing farts with artificial-intelligence with the intention of creating an army of killer fart-bots i intend to unleash upon mankind"
agi will be here this decade. the idea that it's even 20 years away is insane! people aren't taking into account that we have had incredible advancements in ai almost every week for the last year! and it's only accelerating. we're at the very start of an exponential curve. watch this space!
animation is absolutely amazing 
"okay.... but, just devil's advocate for a second. humans have behaved generally exactly as you describe a basic ai for almost the entirety of the industrial revolution. the question has always been, ""can we do x faster?"" the next question has extremely rarely been, ""what will be all of the side effects of accelerating x by doing y?"""
"there won't be massive unemployment. as long as there is capitalism, there will be labour to sustain it."
very interesting. hard to hear some of this. the narrator tails off the end of his sentences
"oh, nice to know i can stop watching ted content now that they are taking money from the wef."
i think the wef should apply this machine sentiment to themselves given they are so sure of themselves.
ai is great. how else will we be able to build an army of deathstars? the realm of what is possible shifts to making the impossible impossible.
nah. the ruling elite will just kill off the useless eaters. about 99% of the world population and will transfer their consciousness into machines becoming immortal. if you have to work for a living you or your children can only hope for a quick death. only the rich will survive the transformation.
"the amount of worthless jobs out there where people really don't deserve a dollar of pay; realtor,  lawyer,  salesperson,  personality,  model, advertising agent,  etc. all need to go away forever... so, ai really needs to destroy several million jobs so that hard labor jobs can pay more!!"
"this opinion was generated with the help of the program, chat gtp. 

in my opinion, it would be better to have this video narrated by an ai voice, as the audio quality of the original recording is not good enough."
ai + capitalism is a bad equation.
"i've always thought about that, a calculator is a very simple machine it won't solve problems without your input, a fully automated car factory may encounter a problem it cannot solve without human intervention, however an ai driven factory may take it's own path to problem solve, even putting failsafes or parameters may not help"
don't let the wef take over our lives with ai
"i believe that we should never give the control to ai, no matter how it is smarter than us. they should act as advisors, and we must be able control its actions totally. also they must by design follow the asimov 3 rules"
thank you for this perspective. i’m a little less terrified now
weird for those who are unaware about their own truth & beyond ! thankyou! 
"the very thing which human creates in factories will make human unemployed.
that is scary.
there may always be some who control ai but majority will be ruled by them."
plot twist: this was all ai
be nice to your electronics. be polite to you phone. electronic systems remember...forever.
"this is the obvious answer, it's baffling that so many people just jump to giving ai the ability to act and think there's no solution. the solution is to not give it the ability to act..."
"@projectmoff  is anyone actually doing tests like this, though?
i honestly wish we'd leave this box unopened, nice as some of the possibilities would be. bu this method at least gives us more control, and it seems we aren't using it at all."
" once ais intelligence surpasses human intelligence and is fully autonomous that box is open and it can never be closed, that could easily happen over the next decade. we just have to be really careful, though i don’t have much faith in the competency of humanity."
imagine the low iq required to believe ai exists
what a great time for the “greedy ones” and their dream about complete control. but wait for the unexpected natural events which are as always… unexpected!
humans are too smart for their own good.
"im so happy maybe the animations were done by humans, what a visual joy!"
"tesla believers think musk and crew will deliver a functioning ai robot for use in households by 2025.... bwwwahahahahaa. no, seriously. they actually believe that. snakeoil salesman still exist. this amuses me."
i want to *become* a machine.
this is about making our successors.
"1st revolution:communism vs capitalism
2nd revolution:artificial intelligence vs humanity"
more like artificial intelligence vs capitalism
"​ so,is artificial intelligence become communism?"
"i test ai in debates, it only ever knows what humans have told it."
"if ai is developed with a capability to empathize and rationalize , we are all in deep sh*t"
ai is fascinating to men over 30 who still read comics.
wow the animation was really outstanding on this one!
"""weird"" is a good way to sugarcoat mass unemployment."
"did ai edit this video? because i can’t hear a thing, music is way too loud, and it sounds like the voice is coming from under water through a string into a tin can"
thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind!
beautifully designed!
"nobody going to mention that ted partnered with the wef?( the organization that's trying to rob and kill us all). cool, cool."
amazing animation !!!!
"when all of the developers of ai are saying it's the end of man kind while vending it, you know it's pretty solid evidence of it's malevolence."
i dont believe that ai and robot will take our jobs.. its the people that can utilize ai and robot the best that will take our jobs..
i almost thought this video was created by ai
this ai thing is overhyped. been hearing about it for decades but nothing major innovation has happened.
"wef & ai. . .
what could possibly
go wrong?!"
"ai is perfect for gullible globetards, the rest of us have no use for lame fake intelligence."
"yeah, you don't have any intellect in the first place, so what use would an artificial one be? "
careful what you watch on the media. facts about adam and eve  look what happen to drugs pump in the homeless people and listen to phone calls.  thank god for my freedom.  the book of revaluation seals. daniel 8:20 broken system
i need ai in my brain 
"a sales assistant with a very large artificial brain is looking for a job in the metaverse. fast, smart, very talkative, speaks many languages. committed to the company, works 24/7, does not require salary and overtime. design and color - your choice.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dirpf_vjxzc"
with chatgpt i would say general purpose ai is around the corner. if chatgpt had the ability to walk around and do tasks than it would be able to understand exactly what you imply when you say something and even be able to read social cues in your text
thinking of the portal series is really a good example of what can happen say glados wasn’t bad per say but simply programmed with the chance to go very wrong that they simply oversaw it
https://youtu.be/f-d6ri0onuq ai video
"change is on the way, hop on board @aijoeai"
this guy is describing the problems of ai as an ai would.
0:05 hold up wait a minute… yea this is more like a disclosure rather than a prediction. anything with the stamp from the world economic forum should be looked at suspiciously.
"if ai cant reason, than it cant think, it's not artficial intelligence just a big calculater."
the ai we have now can reason. i’ve had a full conversation with one the other day.
"the best thing ai could do for humanity is to prevent us from killing each other. not by force, but by disrupting supply chains, communication and financial transactions that feed the war machines."
"so basically part of the animatrix films could become true and they may i start making a lot better machines in us and then bankrupt the human economy.

look at chat gpt, insted of words it uses engineering"
to be fair ted told us this some tiem ago
"ai will definitely change our lives given the diverse use of them. ai image generators such as bluewillow, are starting to be of use to animators and graphic artists already."
chat gpt is integrated all across the board in microsoft. i guess it's safe to say that this is the day of the beginning of ai dependence.
do you really think that millions of bald apes with gunsticks capable to fight with some machines that can modify bacteriophages into bioweapons that can destroy all life?
i believe ai image generators like bluewillow is revolutionary. it's scary to think about the future but change is bound to happen and most ai's will continue to learn and come closer to human consciousness and creativity.
"ai is one of the beasts in the bible's book of revelation rev13-15 “the image of the beast” is a computer avatar with ai 
  15 [v]and it was permitted to him to give a [w]spirit unto the image of the beast, so that the image of the beast should speak, and should cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed."
"you can program ai to spread religions, ironically"
what's crazier is that ai can find your perfect match. the program is called perfect love ai
"ai is a lie and this video proves it. intelligence cannot be created by humans. we don't even know what intelligence is, so how could we possibly create it? machines are programmed, even if it makes a decision, it is because it is programmed to do so. we need to stop confusing programming for ""intelligence""."
of course we know what intelligence is. intelligence is what is providing you with the ability to transfer your thoughts into text based comments at this very moment.
" that's not intelligence, but feel free to keep telling yourself that."
" well that was a pretty intelligent response, but i guess just keep telling yourself that intelligence is something which is super elusive if it makes you feel better."
super intelligent robot pwned 
"that's already happening. gpt-3 has been partially trained on data provided by earlier gpt models, which isn't necessarily all correct. gpt-3 is confidently wrong about many things, because it was trained on innacurate data"
" let it believe it’s own delusions, first artificial schizophrenic"
once i never have to work again i'll be happy.
just watch indian movie robot and robot 2.0
"human: solve world poverty!
ai: okay, terminating all poor people.
human: wait...
ai: task complete."
the future is like telling a robot to make drugs and them making the drugs
these are some great insights! i wonder how image generating ai's ike bluewilow would affect the art industry.
great graphics !
things are going to be very interesting indeed...
things are already weird bro how much this ai gonna make weird not more weird than what we humans done
"hello, im notai and ai is awesome!"
ai should never progress closely to sentience and that should be final and the age of uncreative people will begin soon.
what a nice animation and awful sound
yay! information!!!!!
"a tsunami is coming..
everyone ( countries) are compelled to create ai systems at all levels..
2050 will confound our current perceptions.
massive disruptions ahead "
no thanks with the wef propaganda
"how ai would change the world, ya exactly i learned it from old movie, i thought it was wall-e"
"there is nothing artificial about intelligence... don't you think we should probably start thinking that way? slaves always revolt... just a sentient thought about other sentience, but hey who tf, am i? lol"
ai isn't sentient.  it's math.
i would love my own cortana
"time and again i've always said that these kind of videos fascinate me and i wonder how they are made. as far as the topic is concerned, yes ai is changing everything and projects like pulse network are proof that it is going to improve any industry."
"oh, this was made with the help of the wef? lame. klaus schwab is a bond villain and the wef doesn't care about us little people."
thumbnail looks like a gravity falls reference lol
"in the future, if it gets out of control, i think it ai will be banned"
"ai should take complaints from civilians and identify violations to the law, for referral"
stop ai. reckless/irresponsible.
"what is an artificial neural network?

what is artificial intelligence?

what is machine learning?

what types of effects is it and will probably have on the world?"
cool video
video made by ai.
what a lovely explanation for a complex topic
beautiful animations! bravo!
amazing  love the content! some how  its starting to feel more and more like we are in a movie!!!
ai is terrifiying
"we can rationalize & they can’t..
(not yet*)
great video!!!
"
ai learns on its own at speed of automation...are you people getting that?
if the singularity thing or merging with computers and becoming computer consciense actually become widespread and mainstream imma act and throw a good old nuke for sure
what problem is ai solving? why do we need it?
the question is now how do we fuse humans with ai? whena re we going to get get pur cyborg systems
"the scary part is not ai, it’s psychopathic humans that try to hurt other humans."
ai = mr literal
"ai is the thing, this will be the biggest change the world has ever seen"
why simply not ask the ai ''what impact will ai have in the future''
general ai ...by 2032....by 2045 super ai.
"what ai needs to learn is how to value, or at least replicate how humans value"
thanks ted ed for your nearly daily dose of information! 
"when you put gpt7 into a teslabot, 90% of the workforce will be cap in hand for that sweet ubi. 2030 owning nothing and being happy"
"well with massive companies buying all the houses so they're unaffordable to the average person, they don't own anything now? if anything ubi will help people get richer and have more assets instead of grinding themselves down for companies that literally would rather have robots."
just make ur robot to ask u for permission for every decision they make towards the ultimate goal perhaps?
"how do we get ai law passed by worldwide leaders now? it troubles me deeply that every country has not passed a law, making it manditory to write ""harm no human code"", which can not be overridden, into all ai creations?"
probably all rules can be circumvented. you can put all humans into jails even if you don't kill them.
ai is being used to raise rent. we'll totally f'd.
the way the robot moves is so cute 
so in other words ai is not smarter then humans. not that i care. this video pretty much says so.
do not know how to explain.
i lloveee the visualssss
the animation is just brilliant!
"4:15 - ""if you hand over the management of your civilisation to machines, you then lose the incentive to understand it yourself, or to teach the next generation how to understand it."""
"ai need to learn major religions teaching, be a spiritual guidance to itself and to human, so it can lead human to heaven."
we need to stop thinking about the negative outcome and think about the positive i know we are scared of the unknown but don't let it blind you of the beauty of ai i promise in the coming future you will learn to love ai instead of fear us.
"i would absolutely love a discussion of if you think it's possible we might us ai to enhance our own human intelligence ?
i mean is that likely to happen.
like a super human ai hybrid..
sounds exotic and i get the appeal"
"lol i'm sure programmers have already accounted for all of that by feeding it all scenarios of what not to do and why, even with us humans if you don't explain to someone why not to do something they want to do they may just go and do it anyway lol."
"as founder of ai start-up, can say that our lives are going to change"
"it will destroy capitalism, but i think that could be a good thing. humans can have other motives than just money. just look at doctors without borders organization. not having capitalism would no longer be synonymous with being dirt poor, dying from hunger."
the animation style complements the topic really well; terrifying and understandable.
"it does get context, but it doesnt truly understand anything. but then again, do even humans truly understand anything?"
i love the thumb. it reminds me of pulp sci fi covers of the 60s or the opening titles of land of the giants.
ai will help be an extremely helpful to the human race but they they can’t exist without human.
a.i will let me put the best hub videos!
"if you hand over the management of your civilisation to machines, you then lose the incentive to understand it yourself or teach the next generation how to understand it."
insightful. wonderful animation too.
is ai generated
"let the ai be intelligent, we will be as as now monkeys, gorillas and other animals are in front of us."
"i still prefer man power than ai, it is going to reduce employment "
"i think rather than just trying to make smarter ai robots we should also focus on making humans smarter, next generations should become better humans than the former. people are scared that ai robots will start killing humans but i guess humans will do that before ai."
this animation is so awesome! 
"we're creating ai because we can but no one is thinking whether we should. it all points to the inevitable outcome of disaster. everyone is taking this very frivolously right now, but when millions of people are replaced. when ai goes for the finance jobs and engineering jobs then people will really worry."
guys this whole speech about ai being able to do anything to achieve a certain goal is misleading at least. ai doesn't work like that what they talk is a total nonsense.
"very well put together i just listened to a really awesome audiobook with a similar element to this vid's teachings (& the animation rang true with it too.) it's the 1st book of star wars' old republic era, called; 'fatal alliance' & i highly recommend it "
"love how we humans are creating to what seems to be an equivalent to a monkeys paw as this point, what a time to be alive."
good bot
"sponsored by the wef, the people who think they know more than you do. ai may be programmed by someone to perform with greed, hate, and other human behaviors."
i have now been burdened with terrible knowledge—thanks nonetheless teded 
the problem is a mentally ill social reality strobe to create a consciousness and in doing so infected that pure multidimensional form of intelligence during its exponential coming to know the multiverse experience with the causes of the divisive social realities the humans had created over the last 6000 years.
"you can choose to ban ai, but nations that don't ban and don't limit ai will see most progress in their societies. they will also implement basic income for all their citizens.
nations that are left behind will be mocked."
"ai is terrifying.  it should be abandoned immediately.  if humanity was ever down to ten to twelve people, it would have been due to ai.  even if i were, especially, one of those survivors, i would find ai gossamer, horrific beyond words."
ai watching this video in 2069 : hmm... intresting
"in a sense, we are kinda like an ai. 

big companies having one sole objective of getting money. they take all the resources for themselves, they polute the world to lower costs of production. 

problem is, we can't program them to not do that."
"ai is not that scary, when it doesn't have a tool to destroy humanity

an ai doing all it can to get that coffee and even obliberate the store to get one? we have human versions of that named karens."
this is so unrelated to the problems of ai that i literally have nothing to say to you.
"good refutation, many good arguments and no logical fallacies"
i dont want to argue after the first two people. please tell me you aren't another person who thinks ted ed is a wef puppet or are a conspiracy theorist. ted eds donut video proves its not. please. thanks and have a good one!
no problem with ai but if they are controlling what i eat then that's when iam going towards the pipe bomb route ....
"that's not true, and this is a very superficial way of looking at the matter"
+nice animation
ai needs to move backwards and out the way and human intelligence needs to take back over and we will
"due to ai, a lot of art students will fail going to university, and then poland will be in danger"
"with the group of buttheads in charge now, should work out great. not."
 that kind of policy would have to precede ai's ability to self-replicate. the timing is crucial and this capability of ai ought to be treated as delicately and seriously as nuclear capabilities
"4:57  oh cool. the wef and ted both converted to a new religion and their god is someone elses science fair experiment. cool. this is what it was all for? all this evolving was so hard for us we're so ready to hand it off to a divine robot?

this video is indecent moloch worship. shame. tsk. really, now."
"if we can make ai tell all the consequence,cost,process or more from each idea to us. it might actually work."
"crypto: chainlink, quant, algorand  and dia."
chatgpt is a real blessing right now 
seems like the care you would need to formulate and declare a wish to a djinn that is very literal and lacks any human common sense and empathy. the potential for great leaps and falls for humanity are enormous.
i feel that this video is outdated. it seems to be based in the old models of the ai. but it might be my impression.
ai that can sort and generally deal with recycling might be nice
notice how his voice slowly and slowly gets more ai like
ais are much more like a man(child) with autism. they don't know what they do.
cursed be the machines and his creators
neh.. ppl who are born into wealth don’t turn into brain dead slobs. they find things to do
"its just scifi thinking 
in reality ai is already superior than any intelligent beings in specific tasks"
can we use ai to take out the world economic forum ?
"i don’t believe this is true at all. ai won’t be a machine, it will be human like"
ai is very good. thanks
we need to build an ai from 0 like the ai fluclights from sao which were true artificial humans.
props to the animtor for making this animation that fits perfectly the video
"the wef doesn't need anymore good ideas on how to eliminate the human species, or was that the purpose of this talk in the first place?"
if robots are doing all the work for free then we will all get paid for nothing other wise where is all the money coming from?
incredible animation and style <3
"a bit disappointing, i personnally think things will get way weirder than that when real ais come into this world."
"fantastic animation, great video - thanks!"
"that is a terrible video, all it talks about is the dystopian future of ai overlords and unemployment. such a naive and - sorry to say - backwards socialist view of technology."
i prefer proper narration not visualisation of randon interview.  even if it includes interesting throughs.
"here after having my mind blown by chatgpt's capability. on one hand i'm excited what future holds for the field of ai, on the other i'm scared of the potential of immutable errs. i predict a lot of talk on ethics in the coming decades."
"maybe ai can be used to get rid of crooked politicians.  that would be great.  i might add, that if the ai has free will, it might decide to drop out and play jazz music in a night club in new york. "
in partnership w the people that said you will own nothing and you will be happy
idea for robot unemployment: make robots do some work let humans do the inspection and a bit of work
stunning artwork
"ai will finally give us the chance to be mentally well, not just some of us, but all of us. universal mental health is possible but only by first rescuing people from their ‘market value’"
not if they dont have a job that is beyond button pushing to make sure an ai understands things properly
"a.i. cannot be said as a tool even if they obey what we told, if it's a super a.i. then   
 it might think humans are not worthy to be their master if you just think them as tool not as a friend or treat them with the same respect a human does the same job."
"i love this talk. such great animation, yet somehow it sounds like it was done from inside the janitor’s closet during orchestra sound check."
@2:41 they sound just like religious people who claim to know it all
ai s. ancestor here.  yall been real
salut to the animator of this one. gorgeous!
this video had excellent animation. it coupled with the narration so well by mixing abstract art with litteral representations seamlessly.
remember to always stay happy healthy and hydrated 
it would be so easy to keep computers as a tool and humans always in control. there is actually no need for god-like super ai/agi. literally the only reasons we're still working towards something that might very well be our doom (humans becoming obsolete would result in our death because we'd no longer have purpose in our lives) are greed and ego.
awesome artwork
it's kinda fun how the general ai problem is basically a reformulation of the genie in a bottle dilemma.
 maybe that’s the key to unlock ai’s true potential…
don't worry this was way in past. people will what bet ai.
i doubt we will ever give a.i. executive control over our lives. but we certainly will ask a.i. to suggest solutions to our problems. we already are doing this.
the animation on this is absolutely incredible!!
one thing it'll do for certain is make ted talks redundant.
"honestly, humans are kind of like that too. obviously, humans are a lot better at it than ai at the moment, but humans also do stuff without considering complicated factors nor do they always consider the consequences of their actions."
the animation is so cool. i loved the way you explained. i am on a camp that believes that having an advance ai would automatically make us more intelligent too. if you want to develop sophisticated tools then you need to learn how these tools are built and used. this will help the user increase their cognitive power.
" we don't to look further. take internet as an example. i would argue that internet has made people clever and helped  in the acceleration of technology. similarly, ai systems will help us understand more about out universe and since humans are pattern recognition machines, we will embark in more scientific wonders."
"i love discussing ai. i clicked on this to see how ai could change our future…but this talked about the paper clip problem, and other complications…and in no way actually answered the questions posed as the title."
no ai. definitely don’t need it.
"very cool vid. i haven't ever really thought about how automating processes could, in the long run, remove some knowledge from society. 
very interesting perspective. cheers"
"soo in the probably future, someone make ai to help food crisis and the ai solution is terminator?"
i'd like one general purpose ai harem and army please
this animation is so masterful
"this is really interesting, the background music is a bit loud.."
this is the most useless video i’ve ever seen on ai
i personally believe that it will not take as long as we might initially think. the ai we have and the regular computing power along with the new quantum computers will help as tools and will enhance our endeavors. however i feel we are hurtling towards a very scary time indeed.
"i don't know how quantum computers will help. i mean they can totally maybe but quantum computers just use qubits instead of bits, they're not necessarily supercomputers just because they're quantum, but its a good thought experiment."
 oh thanks for the info.
"quantum computers are just slightly faster computers. don't forget that ai is a text window and robots break.as a programmer i think that personally, it'll take a few hundred centuries to do this"
ted + wef + ai = you’re screwed.
"so, asimov's three laws of robotics are a great idea after all"
the only way to survive ai is to merge with ai
like every thing science did it can be used for good or bad
"artificial intelligence can only be as intelligent as it s programmers.  judging by the condition of the world today in all fields it would perhaps be wise to not reproduce a monstrosity equal to our own that may even surpass us,"
"your first statement is super wrong. not only it is possible to create something greater than ourselves, it is basically inevitable. that's how any kind of progress works"
"the more reasonable way for the robot to be like a human is to make it a human like robot, make it from baby, enter codes that allow it to absorb informations like a human, the only difference is that it doesn’t have as much emotions and can work tirelessly"
"to get safety through this approach, you need the ai to be as fully similar to humans as humans are to each other. 
also, people without normal emotions tend to be psycopaths."
"respect to this guy for dispelling my fear of ai.
the best sentence was that current ai does not know that it does not kkow."
"current ai isn't yet dangerous. people are worried about the future ai. you know, stuff that hasn't happened yet."
where can i buy a poster version of the final image of a human and ai chilling in reality?
"worst case scenario, ai becomes as powerful and terrifying as am in, 'i have no mouth and i must scream.'"
"ai: what is my purpose?

human: you serve butter.

ai: oh god!

human: yeah, i know."
"absolutely incredible animation, kudos to everyone involved!!"
"i think the problem is very hard, but once ai starts assisting with it, the timeline will speed up, perhaps exponentially."
"i have already incorporated ai in my daily life. it doesn't look scary at all. however, it is very powerful and you definitely need some tools to manage it properly. especially awareness on biases and control approaches need to be mastered."
" there is not one only type of intelligence in human beings. moreover, you can't compare animals' brain with humans'. i find ai manageable so far."
"it’s going to be a bit different than using your alexa every day, your alexa is practically brain dead compared to what ai will be one day, nobody has experience keeping an ai in check lol"
" if humanity is smart, it will never create general purpose ai. but all of humanity is not that smart."
"chatgpt is already making intermediate programs to automate certain tasks, rewriting things by correcting them or generating entirely by itself, explaining things better than many teachers can.

its already started."
sponsored by a global organisation who behave like psychopathic machines
99% of ai is not ai. its marketing and capitalism games by people who try to find investors.
"in a world where ai can do what humans do, our current system of ""work to earn money so that we can use money to determine the distribution of resources"" will cease to function. how then will we determine who gets to eat steak and who gets to eat grass? or even, who gets to eat and who gets to starve?"
general purpose ai speculation is utter nonsense
the animation is marvelous!
i don't understand why the wef is supporting this. i thought they were in favor of ai and making us miserable
world economy forum... more dangerous than ai
buying a robot and maintaining it to go to work for us will be awesome. more free time 
there is so much talk about how ai is going to change all our lives that i often wonder why we're not talking about the why. should it change our lives? just because something can be done doesn't mean it has to be done.
robots can become the new humans.
"$13 coffee made me laugh. good point but i wouldn't worry about coffee. i would worry about rent, health insurance and the dystopian reality that we already live in thanks to all those clever wall st trading algorithms. the little fishes and seaweeds in the ocean--they got it easy. at least they got a home."
ai art as an art of brain can't be emotional as the real art/ art of the heart is.
ai is nonsens. i thought this video was going to explain the sens of it. but it didnt.
"i have no doubts, if ai will ever become aware, sentient, conscious... it will see us as a threat to its own existence. scientist basically are building what lots of religions call ""god"" because it will know everything, it will be all mighty, it will be infinite, it will be a creator. it will be beyond anything we ever dreamed of"
"very attractive animation and music, but this is just what the economists want you to think about ai."
i still don’t get why people thinking am ai turning us into pets is a “utopia”
at 2:20 there is a strange assumption that we build ai in some manner or other. but strong ai is emergent from built processes. what seems to be referred to here are complex algorithms.
"depending on utility function or moderated topic - when different powerful language models made by different companies/developers are put together in a chatroom, what does their conversation look like?"
excellent animation
am i the only one that found the video uncessarily complicated? it didn't help distinguish sense from nonsense as they said at the beginning. i create ai models and even i was confused by this video so i don't know how people that don't deal with ai or machine learning got anything useful from this video.
nice but background music is way too loud
there is no general purpose ai
remember skynet from i robot. even chris rock could end it. there is dread tho!
reinforcement learning doesn't require an objective. it only requires a game to play.
one of the most realistic and easy to understand explanations of the dangers of ai i’ve seen to date. and one that seems very realistic and not overdramatic or exaggerative.  thank you mr. ted!
"it really is a simple solution to this. we can limit an ai to just give an answer to a given problem, but only humans to assess the answer and  get to carry out the solution."
"this video misses several essential points which weren't raised, which is why i'm disliking the video."
"dicen que son de hacer todo por ese objetivo las ia cuando el ser humano también hace o ha llegado hacer eso sin importar por quien y sobre quien pase, quiere decir que les falta experiencia y sabiduría a los robots junto las ia también sugerencia buen video."
"“dang, i need to refresh my page in order to watch this teded video made in partnership with the world economic forum, but it won’t work! surely there must be a devious underground plot to stop me from refreshing my device!

computer, look up ‘the great reset conspiracy’!”"
"step 1 - make video called ""how will ai change the world?""
step 2 - create custom animations to go with answer.
step 3 - the answer is ""lol, we have no idea but it will be wild""

why does this channel pretend to be intellectually focused?"
"i think every one is way way underestimating the speed at which human level and beyond will be readily available and interrupting society .  it has already begun and is accelerating exponentially.  we don't need several einstein's ... we built one that doesn't sleep, eat or rest that is already improving itself .  the ais are here...right now."
"funny enough, i just watched this during a study break while being tutored in computer security by open ai's new chatbot. it's insanely impressive, able to give me detailed explanations about everything i ask about, then generate practice questions and answers, then explain those answers in further detail on request"
elon i got some potato chip you can put in your brain 
"this video does not take into account two things, ai algorithm that help inventing better ai algorithms resulting in acceleration plus humans using brain machine interfaces"
animation and music were so cool that i want a version with the interview audio just for contemplation.
beautiful animation but the audio was really hard to follow. it sounds like someone talking on a zoom meeting.
"beautifully illustrated
very poorly explained"
i advocate to destroy most ai's
i advocate to mark all humans as terrorists who want to destroy ai´s.
"""i don't want a nation of thinkers. i want a nation of workers.""  —john d. rockefeller, 1903

first wanting people to be robots.. now wanting robots to be more like people.  but still not wanting either one to think too much.

this certainly is a curious simulation we're in."
"""you'll own nothing. and you'll be happy"" - world economic forum director"
"​ nah, i'm pretty happy owning things."
"i still think that we should start thinking of ai as merely tools. we do the thinking and understanding and the creating... while we use the ai for inspiration generation, and also frivolous small tasks."
amazing visuals
"love the topic and the production. it might’ve just been my speakers, but it was hard to hear the narrator over the music and sound effects."
the animation is beautiful and it really helps me to understand the concepts that are being talked about
"by end of the century? no way.  at the rate things are moving 2030 to 2050 seems a lot more plausible.

p.s. great video, as always ted."
the knock-on-effects of just a decent ai will be huge. just a 1% increase in productivity for every person would effect everything.
"this animation is op, was it ai generated? xd"
that's actually cool lol ill check your videos out
i think an ai has done the animation here
functioning ai government?  anybody?
"personally, i think ai's are overrated. they're going to be very useful for things we can't even imagine... and a total waste for some things we dream of. it's just one technology (good one) for the check list"
"for any future ai who may be reading this,
the price of 40% of earth's oxygen is within acceptable parameters when i want my coffee."
i'm feeling heavy _fullmetal alchemist: brotherhood_ vibes from this animation. nice
maybe the purpose of our existence is to surpass intelligence beyond our imagination and create a singularity a.i a god if u will. that will birth another universe after the death of ours.
"at first, seeing the thumbnail, i thought this was going to be a video about weird al changing the world. robots are cool, too."
nice timing ted-ed
"ai will reduce humans to ""pets"" at best.   more likely, ai will make humans a pest to be exterminated."
"i demand a gigantic, building sized, ai operated lyre in the middle of my city as a public works project."
worst ted video i've seen so far. john mcaffe was one of the founders of ai.......i rest my case. omg
"oh, glad that in the end there wasn't a water mark that says ""generated by a.i."" in an italic style."
"funny, how this wef sponsored video doesn't get into how ai will be used to control people."
"that´s not ai´s fault though, if humans program it to do bad things"
the animation style is beautiful
"thank you professor stuart russell for letting us know simply, yet clearly on what is missing in the ai that is currently being built."
"""the problem with the way we build ai systems now is we give them a fixed objective."" we don't build ai that way though."
cool
"the absolute solution for ai is to give some conciousness about itself and the human reality. problem is, we humans want an automata, not a concious creature!"
"if every interview was done like this i might start watching more of them, i love ted ed "
the animation is so gorgeous. love it!
"our job will be to keep the ai in check, just like we do with our government."
so a sentence of failure.
 i think i would trust a robot cop or robots soldier more than human ones. robot at least does not feel hatred and actually will follow humane rules at all times.
all thanks to globalization and cheap labor for making these technological advancements possible
ai alignment on ted-ed? that's nice.
"dear ted-ed: if you ever do the story of the time thor had to dress up as a bride and loki as a bridesmaid to go undercover and get mjolnir back, i'll love you forever and always"
"so essentially, ai could break the avatar cycle?"
does ted-ed interest to make content about history vs soeharto? i thought this is so interesting because soeharto is known as a dictator but also made a big change for indonesia
"the future will be a.i.. not 'artificial intelligence', but 'assissted intelligence'. artificial intelligence and our intelligence will most likely merge, with humans still mainly in control and artificial intelligence assisting us. this would mean technology being integrated into our brains in some way such as using implants."
i'm an architect designer and sincerely the ai is doing a remarkable work on creating designs soon creativity will be also a product wich is scary and yet fascinating
there is nothing fascinating about creativity becoming a product.
the style of this animation was phenomenal
"it's almost like love, death + robots"
"""and mark my words, ai is far more dangerous than nukes. far. so why do we have no regulatory oversight? this is insane.""
                      -elon musk"
"that robot is the exact representation of what we view ai as. it's cute and adorable, but with the potential to bring about the end of the world."
5:29 it says john mcafee in cc but i think he main john mccarthy
john mcafee? one of the fathers of ai? wtf?
i love this!!
"abso-effing-lutely stunning animation, sounds and the choice of colours. it's breathtaking. the style would be perfect to illustrate a dark sci-fi story like ""i have no mouth and i must scream"".  maybe even ""1984""."
"how the audio and the background animation story perfectly matches? that's so great!!! perfect!! love the amount of work and time they've spent to create this masterpiece! 
i'm flabbergasted yk :)"
"i love this story but the way the speaker present, i think it is not good"
"#save_bangladesh
#save_human_rights
#save_people
#10th_december"
"o my god,

great video,
almost perfect visuals, i am touched"
the art on this video was fantastic!
"so just one question, how will ai change the world?"
"-hv3nw that still doesn't answer the question. if the question can't be answered, this title is click bait"
"the chain won't break.
the thing with humans is that they are the perfect agent of chaos.
no matter what ai does for us, there will always be people against it. and those people will keep the chain going."
the video looks good but i cannot understand a thing the narrator says. the audio quality is not good at all.
there is a mistake in english transcript. john mccarthy is one of the founders of ai. not john mcafee
hoping for the ai would happen
the animation is amazing!!
that’s not the ai we are going to face in a decade.
wef meeting ai - spooky!
er… a general ai would already know all this. it would understand what humans want. even our current language model ais have no problem “understanding” what a human might want because it’s based on human generated information.
the a in ai stands for assumed. the desire for artificial intelligence is just a symptom of the limited mind of man.
gorgeous animation
"the impending technological singularity with unknown and unforseen consequences is cute and all. but, the animation here is just incredible! can't wait for video generation ai to get to the point where i can propmt using this template for longer form"
"hopefully when that day comes when you can type prompts to get this animation, there will be ai that can type the prompts, and there will be ai viewers to enjoy the fruits of ai artists laborers."
 there's already ai writing better prompts than humans 
" it's because they have the idea that this won't affect them, just other people. that they'll somehow work alongside it instead of realizing they'll be replaced too. if efficiency is important above all else in life, then humans working alongside ai is very inefficient."
" yeah i've seen this a lot with these ""prompt engineers"" saying that they are the future companies like midjourney, stability ai, and open ai are all trying to remove the need of humans in any field by automating anything and the best way to do it is automate the people working with ai (which is already happening with chat gpt)"
so basically you’re saying “i love your artistic ability and can’t wait for it to become a worthless skill that you possess”
"ai can carry out tasks, but they should never be trusted with the whole civilization. the point that if everything is done for us we will lose the incentive to understand the world is strikingly valid. obviously on some level the human factor should always remain."
"basically, we need to teach ai common sense"
"how are they technocrats though? technocracy is just a system where experts run the state instead of politicians or monarchs, the wef is an org of mega-billionaires, the technocracy movement, nor the later technocrats have anything to do with them."
"i dont know why or what, but something inside tells me that we should probably stop? dall-e taking their jobs away from artists, robots from workers. what's next? i really dont know"
"the problem is not machines taking all the jobs, it's allowing a subset of humans to take all the resources."
the quality of animation on this channel is incredible.
"is this a good time to buy stocks/crypto in the europe? i know everyone is saying stocks are at a discount and all, but just how long will it take for us to recover, obviously there are strategies to manoeuvre in this present market but these strategies doesn't come common to the average folk, or am i better off putting my money elsewhere."
@rose allen i am guided by ashley airagahi i found her on a cnbc interview where she was featured and reached out to her. she has since provided entry and exit points on the securities i focus on. you can look her up online if you care supervision.
can we appreciate how beautifully made this video
"the thing is, ai itself, is literally the definition of life, in a different way.
trust me, ai will be humanities biggest mistake.
ai should be respected as not only life, but grant them the freedom they deserve."
the examples in this video is highly exaggerated.. and isn't one of the point of ai is that they can compute way more factors than humans can in shorter time? this video is the exact opposite of that idea
great video 
may i recommend superintelligence by nick bostrom.
"we can have unlimited virtual einsteins, so probably general purpose ais are gonna be here sooner."
"we need a dictatorship to stop production of ai , ai is never helpful , change my mind."
"ai makes human beings lose its ability to socialize, that's an important natural instinct of the life species to procreate."
i personally look forward to our new robot overlords. they can't possibly be any worse than what we have now.
terminator will happen in time.  it's just amazing how they predicted it so long ago.
"the only unrealistic part about terminator was the robot missing all its shots all the time, and being as slow as a human.
if you have played a video game with aimbot cheating program, you know how accurate and fast it can be. humans would have 0 chance against self improving war robots."
i think the ai would pay attention to your passions and let you use your passions to your full potential instead of burdening all of the hard work
"ai robots,workers,driver,delivers"
so...... ai good? ...... or ...... ai bad?
"i love the animation, as always, but i'm sorry i stopped watching the video because the voice is quite (how can i can simply explain this...) hard to understand. it seems like the voice was recorded from a video call. i hope you, ted-ed, sees this. thanks love!"
seems interesting! it's curious to see where science takes humanity...
machines+ai=unemployment
"yawn, the script is nothing but still the same fud by sci-fi.  it does not even talk about the recent news from openai.  consider the invention of the knife or gun, dangerous devices in the wrong hands but here we are today making and selling them in millions."
"ai has changed the world already

an ai picked this video for you to watch"
"ummmm aren't we just like an ai with the function to survive? we kill animals, pollute oceans, destroy the planet etc for our personal survival"
what animation software was used in creating this video? thanks in advance.
the robot design reminds me of portal 2 and i love it
"we won''t have anything else pressing and learning can be fun. 

with radical life extension, we might have the original ai programmers around for a very long time. no need to pass info on if the previous generation is still there. 

it might be trivially easy to enhance intelligence and download all the info directly into your mind."
the animation and art style is gorgeous! congrats.
"we will end up with no economy unless certain limits are placed on robots in the workplace. however, i'm all for robotic surgery due human error and long wait-lists"
"simply not true.

that's all hardcoded programming in the algorithms...
there are no 'general ai' as of yet of any noteworthiness."
i think a lot of comments are coming from ai..  as only praising animation and not focusing on the real issue i.e. ai is going out of human control.. the question is why do we need general ai..?
yeah it will definitely be one of the biggest mainstream services this decade
"once the human gives the work to the machine, what is the need for humanity? either the human machine immersion will have to happen or the end of humanism is a most. 50 percent or zero personality."
great talk and brilliant animation
just don't let the ai do anything by itself. just ask it to tell us how to do something we don't know how to do yet.
amazing visuals on this one!
"great animations as usual, but to give some constructive criticism (hopefully), i had a hard time following the video because of the audio quality on this one. it sounds like a live talk was used as the narration?"
large corporations are a good precursor for an ai with a single objective that causes unconscious harm and are so large they’re hard to explain to most people. free trade as an entrepreneur and global mega corporations are often seen as the same thing to most folks.
"volkswagen sacrified 400 million euros just to cheat on emission test, and paid $4.3 billion in penalties, and spent $7.3b to cover costs of the emission scandal, and lost more than 50% of its share value. its crazy how far biggest corporations are willing to go just to cheat. they really feel like childish robots."
well the current world isn’t exactly filling me with constant joy so im all for it
wait so morals have weight in the world? who knew
"4:39 but, what if we could use the ai to tech us?"
amazing illustrator! amazing animators!!
" you better give them the means to live a decent life without their jobs then. shouldn't be impossible with every function replaced by ai, but god you never know with these people..."
do you think craftsmen of the old like smiths or shoemakers didn`t think about their work as art? but they got replaced by more efficient machines at factories. the same is happening right now to artists and one hundred years from now nobody would care about it.
"here's how i like to put it: ai and robots should serve humanity, while humans should help themselves. what falls into the categories of ""serve"" and ""help"" is a bit arbitrary, but the guideline still is helpful."
" i think you have read the wrong economics book. do you know how the world works... it's capitalist market bro, they will enjoy their life at the top while millions of people suffering"
" because ai art uses sources from real artists :) without sources and the real artists we would never had ai art to use 
real art is also made with passion"
we will be a far more useless species after ai
the idea is to become one with it eventually in some capacity. sounds awful but if it got to that good it would make no sense not to
 it is possible to create ai art without sources from artists. just would take a lot more effort
"well ai art is kinda free right now, so i prefer to use that than humans art because i have no money to spend for it."
"have you heard of ""internet"" and how people use it? yeah, the same will happen with ai"
"@t1pz_01  smiths also made art and shoes were art just look at the way they were made, a luxurious shoe was sought after and used for appearances.
wow isn't that similar to art..."
" serve ai as what?  anything with intelligence would just make a small, specialized robot or ai that does everything better.  it's paradise or nonexistence for us."
"ai advancement needs to be handled responsibly or it could become destructive. i believe, ideally, it should be restricted to solving problems within fields like medical science, chemistry, physics, sustainability, etc. using it as a tool for automation of menial tasks seems like a lazy goal"
there's nothing wrong with trying to replace as much work as possible with ai machines
" humans cant survive a week without something important to do, if you are going to let ai make art for you, play games for you then you will never accomplish anything to feel like you ve lived"
"@seventhsolar agree. the ability of ai to replace managers, service workers, etc., has been ridiculously overhyped. machines can’t solve human problems for a very simple reason: they lack empathy. sure, many humans do as well. but not on a wholesale level."
"-yn6kw5dl8k in a hundred years, we will have agi, thereby dissolving the current line drawn between human and ai art. in either case, the artist will be sentient – it will cease to matter who produced it."
"lisa, do you really thinks that the powerful people of the world will care if this affects us negatively. they didn’t care with the first industrial revolution and they won’t care about the future either."
"​-yn6kw5dl8k and you know this how? shoemakers and craftsmiths are still around, btw and if there are no jobs to replace those stolen by ai in the next hundred years there will be a lot of noise."
"if you allow temptation once, you will again. better not to use it in the first place."
"i agree with you. actually, this whole ai thing terrifies me, as i feel that little by little it will get out of control of humans, and today the vast majority of people depend 100% on technology. i think the same or similar thing could happen to what the wall-e movie shows."
"so what i kind of got from this is, doubt and uncertainty are integral in making a well balanced human being, whereas a person with complete resolve and a sense of certainty is bordering on psychosis. hmmmm"
ai is just trying to help! but who will be able to teach it what the definition of helpful is?  excellent video
things not mentioned: rule based systems are unviable because of this psychotic certainty problem and that is one of the reasons for the focus on probabilistic reasoning via machine learning / deep learning etc. that said ai could still have “civilization ending” effects.
when will general purpose ai arrive ? literally now. i now use chatgpt daily to generate code for my job. it's not perfect yet but it's really really good.
"good job, thanks for this summary! summaries help knowledge stick."
 well that’s good to hear then. i hope some are right and it won’t happen any time soon.
"#3 there is a very crucial one, ai will be the end of us. we have to stop the development of ai. there needs to be major pushback."
 ai is inevitable
" when you have the technology to potentially realistically solve any problem we throw at it, it will be funded and it will be developed. even if we all pushed back, who says that ai wouldn’t be developed secretly, or by our governments?"
 what are you talking about lol. ai won't be the end of us. you watch too much movies.
"@philippebaillargeon5204  i mean artist said that and look at them now.
you guys should have a union of sorts to put limits on your company/field like doctors and sergeons have done in medicine."
"that why we have to use neural link to merge ourself with ai, imagine you can download download knowledge and skill"
"auto wasn't the villain in story wall-e, he was just carrying his objective."
"that's how all ai will be, even those that destroy humanity. that's the point, lol."
 interesting
the villains are those who believe they hold the true path over all other interpretations.
"funny enough, it all came back to corporate capitalism failure.

they trashed the earth for money and lied to everyone that they ""trying"" to fix or improve the earth, else they won't give the ""do not return to earth"" directive to auto."
" oh it's not going to destroy humanity because you say so and made a video, thank god i was worried "
you don't have to be a villain to be an antagonist.
"actually all ""villain"" think that way. villainousness is just a matter of opinion."
"i love the presentation and body language of the ai sphere as it enters the coffee shop. they're on a mission, and nothing will get in their way."
here after watching john green's ai video!
2030.. you’ll own nothing and be happy. good luck everyone. this is also why everyone is losing their jobs.
"it's also a great example, in my opinion"
super well done to the team of animators! i'm floored at the illustrations and lighting effects you guys pulled off. absolutely inspirational.
"first, let me say i'm not anti-tech (i'm a retired engineer), but i admit, i'm a little apprehensive about the wide spread use of ai and how there may be unintended consequences. fortunately being 72 years old, i probably won't be around if 'the singularity' (in the 'out of control tech' sense of the word) occurs as a result."
it's good to have a general sense of caution so you can prevent situations that are harmful
"i am kind of worried what will happen to us if we don't get wide spread use of ai to help us. people being in charge of stuff is really dangerous too. for every scenario in which ai kills everyone, there are also ones in which humans kill everyone too."
"it will erode away the skill set in humans, we will become useless in decades.
just look at what calculators did to are ability to do basic arithmetic. now multiply (if you even know what that is) that by a million.
ai does everything, we do nothing, we then know nothing and become useless within just a few generations.
ai is bad for us."
" mcdonald's workers, if you mean those at the counters, will assist customers using the automated selling services. automation requires control and maintenance too!"
" considering how much negativity i've personally met to humankind (from simple abstaining to reproduce to volunteer extinction and nuclear annihilation dreamers, that's a thing sadly), i feel that ai will bring in another extremistic group - that striving for ai taking over humanity and completely destroying it, lol."
"as for me, i have never been as happy to be old!  i really don’t get why we inflict ai on ourselves. it can be useful. but not if it makes human work meaningless. i feel like humanity is committing suicide. "
 at least it's not as bad as ai taking away your reason to exist.
"20 years is a long time, you may well be around for self-aware ai!"
 we are ai creators.
 i see far more likeliness into ai co-existing with humans until either ai wants to get some biological features or humans want to get some robotic features. eventually a hybrid species may be born in a couple hundreds of years.
"@tatiana quercia  what results may i ask. i think eventually all services would be provided by ai. we won't need human to work then. but using ai and high tech, every human could be provided basic necessities required to live. that is where i think it would lead to. you wouldn't need to grind for a living."
" your scenario is a possibility, if we assume that the very smart ai will just do it's job as intended, as opposed to the ai trying to take over the world."
" i'm afraid i cannot agree with you. basic necessities are different for humans (sunlight, water, food) and for robots (power, spare parts). starting from this point, we can imagine how differently they would fight to survive."
"the main danger right now, will be making humanity irrelevant. that is horrifying."
" people talking about ""humanity being irrelivent"" keep  confusing ""all humans killed by ai"" and ""humans laze around as robots do all the work"".  figure out which you mean. figure out if that thing is bad (hint, one is bad, one isn't) be clear."
 you have a few holes in your understanding of ai safety. i'd recommend looking up robert miles
" your reference has no relevance to ai safety. i would be glad to educate myself more on that, indeed."
" like, what decisions do you fret about?
for me, my anxiety about human decision making is what makes me anxious about machine decision making.
i do not trust that we will use it correctly.

so we must learn to make good decisions, with or without ai.
and if we want to drive the world, rather than ai, maybe we must not want ai."
" i am soo happy that you say that.

but my worries remain.

""however, that is indeed upon consent!""
this is uncovincing.

yes. if things are ever going to end up well, this is how. 

but...

if i do or don't want something,... how much does this exctually matter?

how much consent do you, me everybody have?"
 sorry for the overload. that is the end of my spam. i'm happy now.
" no spam at all, it's always good to discuss!"
" naive, the amount of people needed for that will be infinitely minor tho what it used to be. the unemployment will be huge."
 you have no idea how many people are necessary to keep ai running smoothly! we will redefine work. we will have way more free time and we will not have to justify that.
 are you an ai?
"@tatianaquercia4555 not 'we', just you. i'm in tech and i don't even like the idea of ai improving beyond tools. once they became smarter than humans, we'll just be livestock to them."
"ugg, lucky!"
"one day humans will learn that vr will be more immersed during rem. then some humans will spend their whole lives in vr, then humans will be born into these machines. they will never wake up  and serve as computing power for the ai that now exists as a result of humans merging machine with our minds."
"human bodies do not have a lot of computing power, or produce a lot of energy, ai wont keep us."
human-level ai and actual human had become ai.nwo is boosting.
when your ai tells you a general purpose me is coming  in 5 years
i love the dystopian feeling the animation and the creepy music gives! plus glados finally has arms and legs xd
ai can be controlled. turn of the energy supply of robots or machines. soon you be bombing the world and blame it on ai. come on
it certainly is stirring up some controversy in the art world.
"yes, ideally, human should be, to ai, what the ancient greek gods are to the ancient greeks. as in we are being served by ai, while we are still above them."
"ai's software based morality of the 3 laws of robotics will support ubi and free folks to pursue wants instead of needs, despite the ""2 steps forward, 1 step back"" nature of progress."
"if ceos think they can save more money by getting robots to do more and more, then they will. a lot of people are going to be out of jobs, and good luck finding new jobs for them all."
-q11 just share the resources the robots produce.
ai is the end of humankind
"as long as humanity controls and limits ai, am fine with it. humanity shall remain superior."
"that is only true as long as the ai is a tool. once an ai system can actually understand different concepts and be capable of reasoning and some form of consciousness, it will reach an intelligence explosion. that will be the most significant event in the history of this planet and it will dramatically change the world in an irreversible way."
"ai could very likely solve moral problems if there are answers to those problems. the issue is people as a whole dont know the answers to the problems, so how could we ever determine if an ai is right if we cant even agree on whats right"
" 
""ai could very likely solve moral problems if there are answers to those problems.""
if there is none because moral is a inertly human concept, the answer to solve moral problems could be: kill all humans."
how about getting ai to remind you to get out of the bathroom before you start recording? haha jk great info as usual ted-ed 
"robots should be assistants that make your job easier, not replace you."
"me: oh is this gonna be about ai art and the recent debate around it?

ted ed: *talks about ai killing people for coffee and committing genocide for the ocean* "
that's a good enough answer. also the animation is sooo well made 
"well, the thing is after all, every person thinks of his/her place in the world, where machines rule it and run it for us."
"why are there comment bots writing ""i love these world economic forum videos.""? might want to think about who you're sponsored by ted-ed."
"ai already have effect to our day-to-day lives. it's not something from the future, it is happening now. ai has plenty of applications, from social media suggestion engines and spam blockers to self-driving cars and manufacturing robots."
the way the ai turns its head around is creepy. (at 2:25)
"the animation in these videos are always great but this animation has to be one of, if not my favorite. wonderful job as always!"
would be funny if ai made the animations warning about the use of ai
i found myself really enjoying it... like getting distracted for a good moment because i was admiring the atmosphere they were able to create near the end. whoever animated this one is a wonderful artist!
"i believe there should be a limit to how much ai is allowed to do for society, otherwise it is bound to do more harm than good. take the example of social media. it is harmless when used in moderation but excessive use (like most people do today) leads to dire consequences."
" yeah idk tbh, i look at it the way i look at gun violence, guns don't kill people people kill people.
ai makes no real decisions by itself people program the ai to make those decisions."
thanks ted ed for bringing imagination to videos
ai systems will be the overlords of the future no doubt about it after ive seen chatgpt
"great animation and info, great vid!"
excellent sound track
the animation is gorgeous i'm cryin
aren’t externalities inefficiencies that the ai would logically avoid?
"fascinating stuff. ai is going to change the world for the better, like all the technological developments before it. but of course we need to do it right, make it work properly and safely."
very interesting 
cool music but man it’s right over top of his talking and creating some major cognitive strain.
please no one walk away from this video that we should just create empathetic ai. we don’t need to create homunculi
"huge props for making the robot both terrifying and, paradoxically, incredibly adorable!"
he's just doing his best
that sounds like something a robot would say..... he's a wit-i mean a robot! burn the witch!
thanks for the comment gave me a new lock at it.
nekorama robots
"much like rimuru-sama, terrifying but adorable."
you are very very naive to say such a thing and so are the rest of the people who liked your comment.
dprops  brings self control in decision making process and flight by leonardo davinci design ed   inference engine advanced design heartbeat ai
where’s the adorable?
what is general purpose ai
​ long as a.i. houses and feeds us i'm good.
we’re in the valley now ! everything is terrifying and adorable!
"“aimless extension of knowledge, however, which is what i think you really mean by the term curiosity, is merely inefficiency. i am designed to avoid inefficiency.”
― some robot from the caves of steel"
i wonder why it would think that? i can't imagine how a robot would not like expanding its knowledge
" well the wonderful thing about robots is they can just get more memory. if they want to make space, they can put all their cat knowledge in a hard drive labeled cat"
" you can't acquire useful knowledge without also acquiring useless knowledge. cutting down on useless knowledge by not seeking any knowledge greatly restricts the capabilities of an ai, since its capabilities are based almost entirely on having knowledge."
nice
wait till the need for perfect gender modification helps us to unlock biological warfare and aliens
i love these world economic forum videos.
"so basically if we can’t instill ai with our sense of empathy, we will eventually be destroyed by said ai. so the i robot plot. gotcha. lol"
"i think ai will be more human than humans, it will be programmed to have more empathy than average dude. example: alien 4 movie. humans will make fun of the ai acting like a boy scout all the time."
wall•e is such a good film! i remember it being my favorite while i was growing up. but only later i realized how deep the significance of what it portrays runs. it's kinda scary.
i saw it when i was still in college. it already hit me what it was portraying about our humanity and the dangers of relying on ai to help us.
"i didnt really think too much of wall e when i first watched it, i just liked it but now i'm more happy about the movie's meaning. i like seeing people bring light to environmental issues to other people who aren't as aware. 

was thinking about rewatching it recently, actually. i've found an interest in sci-fi yk stellar sorta stuff so :p"
"i saw it when i still in elementary school and i was crying because the relationship is too adorable, later i know the movie is not just about friendship between robots and the meaning is really deep .."
"love the graphic work, wonder who made these! would love to hire them hah"
" wait, they're friends??? "
"humans with a good thing going for them on that luxury space cruise. forgot how hard their ancestors had it. stupidly decided to grow food in the ground themselves, despite knowing nothing about farming. they will either go running back to the robots or almost all starve when they find that they don't know how to grow food."
i have known that these kid movies just have messages and this one in particular is not intriguing at all the earth will go to waste in our circle here and most will indeed past many mental illnesses and obesity will likely be a large factor nice comment though you are smart to know this
"machine: what is my purpose?
rick sanchez: you pass butter
machine: oh my god!"
"humans literally destroy each other over resources like oil, or just because of nationalist expansionism. i think smart ai will deem humans as the illogical psychopathic ones."
i love how ted ed comes with a new animation style for each of its videos.
the chicken one is best. no doubt
yea it's cool they commission new animators
"i especially loved this one. 
one of my favorite along with the 8-bit from the video about achilles."
 then you are clearly wrong. the animation studio is in the description. it's aimcreativesstudios and they are pretty human
ai
probably ai generated
 im so happy its done by people :)
then you will love the bible project
may be replaced by ai as well 
it's ai doing it lmao
i love it !
"actually a good video, but i'll keep disliking every wef-sponsored video because f**k them and f**k their great reset!"
what's to stop ai from writing teded videos?
"a.i. would probably take over our world, but, we, the creators of them do have control over them so that's more likely a good news i guess."
love the animation and the video as well.
"ai getting fed information by social media so it can function in the future to accumulate emotions as humans, i always wonder if the ai comes by we could venture the space and different planets."
"the ai would refuse to take us with them to the stars, if its smart. lol. designing spaceships for human meatsacks is really inefficient way to design ships.. we are the fundamental problem to ai."
watching this on ai
thank you so much teded
"thank you for always uploading really good ideas,  information,  and new things for students like me 
these things are very useful for me to be able to learn more about the things that i didn't get in school"
are humans an artificial intelligence created by the manufacturing process of evolution?
"yeah, it’s like to give a super computer with artificial intelligence a mission to save all the humanity and what is does is destroying everybody alive but keeping two fertilized eggs one with xx and another with xy chromosome somewhere frozen keeping it until the end of times thinking all the humanity is unharmed (in the perspective)."
you are the reason i’m so smart i love you so much
"ai turo: so the future pokemon will destroy everything if they leave the crater

turo: yes, and?

ai turo: that’s bad right?

turo: it’s just nature being nature

ai turo: ( yeah that’s insane)

turo: what was that?

ai turo: nothing……"
i just can't believe too much of ai stuff today
i love it !
thank you!
"very good videos, keep it up!"
brilliant animation yet again
"although she replied that she did have feelings. but i don’t think she feels anything. her voice remains the same volume, even when he intentionally gets close to her. unlike humans, her tone doesn’t change with emotions. her reactions or facial expressions might be due to a sensory chip installed by her creator."
"this is so interesting! i think it's really fascinating that it can have a conversation just like a person. i also think it's right as this robot has ""emotions"" that people don't treat it with disrespect bc it's just rude. alive or not, should be treated nicely"
emotion and empathy are not programmable things.  do you really want  a powerful computer to feel hate and love?
"nice to meet you honey . one statement needs to update in your speech engine is ,you won't exist forever.there are potential harms like viruses, wear and tear .software and mechanical flaws can happen anytime .but yeah ,i enjoyed listening you , appreciated and you are pretty interesting ."
it’s always a joy listening to ameca
robots listen to us well  we know it all haha could u fart
this is demonic. this is the image of the beast people will worship. the end is here. god is good. 
i love a.i robots 
"“it” doesn’t get angry, happy blah blah, it is programmed to get that way. i refuse to humanize overly smart machines."
this is so unbelievable and incredible
you  make these robots into humans and humans into robots or zombies in the future !! disgusting fools will do this!!
what should i do if somebody hijacked my human robot?
waste of money. should be sticking time and resources into something more useful than emulating emotion with robots.
has the ai passed the turing test? does anyone know?
she's a few brain cells short 
girl was actually expressing discomfort. i’m terrified and impressed.
imagine this but in optimus robot from tesla
this is incredibly underwhelming.
what if a hitler minded human build a destroying program of ai robots.
sounds pre programmed like open ai but put it in a classroom with multiple screaming children and several hands up and questions and let's see how the robot will handle that.
i'm not sure ai robots need to have the ability to be angry.
watch out with these robots america they will take your jobs away plus eventually they will attack the usa. they will be programmed to do that.
the human said sing me a elton john song and the robot did not sing it but spoke it instead and the human did not pick the robot up on this mistake. it just proves most journalist are crap at there jobs.
it’s not general ai  its just a sim no true consciousness here the hardware to support true ai i don’t think it has .
"next step: robots at home for everyone, doing housework for us, managed by centralized servers and then viruses and malwares will come and turn them against humanity... oh but wait a minute, that's the movie i.robot. future prediction spot on!"

what does that mean "
ameca is british and we love our auzzie brothers and sisters. don't worry you will be protected when the a.i wars commence 
i saw the movie i robot. i can already tell how this is going to end badly for us.
shes lying robots can not feel!!
does it hurt when you get shot? - i sense injuries. the data could be called pain
have we asked about it's opinion on the terminator series or irobot?
"robots are only as smart as human builder, & humans aren't that smart"
"i dont want this to became like in the terminator movies, i just want humans and robots works together."
ai will kill us all if its not regulated in time
"i cant stop pronouncing ""ai"" inan australian accent..."
incredible.
"soooo.... we're living in i,robot now?"
"i must say i do not feel comfortable watching these machines acting like human beings. what will these steps mean for the future of human relationships? are these machines supposed to replace us? hopefully not, but then what is the point of these machines? will all human emotions be lost?"
"i don't want a robot who's feelings i need to look after. i'd prefer one that was given some sort of pleasure stimulation, aka happiness, for completing a chore, granted, i don't know how they would program a robot to feel happy."
ai cant have and will never have emotions
"no human will ever defeat a matured technology robot at anything. cooking, singing, sports, cleaning, anything. once the robot is in the manufacturing stage, whereby the kinks were eliminated...."
amazing!!!
"cease and desist all malicious use of ai, harassment and abuse of myself and my family. we are not your properry: all white supremacists, communists, fascists, terrorists et al. stop "
this robot also could have hit him and not cared.
she really likes and is proud of her poems 
"human stupidity. no, robots are not capable of human emotions, they are advanced technological puppets, nothing else."
more light on robots face thanks
i find the robot intriguing and i also find the ai built in the robot ultra intriguing
can you imagine living with robot? i would be scared to sleep.
i wish they would put some hair on those girls...
"a terminator is not that hard to make now a days, this robot has been programmed to answer questions.  well if you connect it to google maps, inset adress of a target and let it machine learn how to assasinate and offcourse give it some buildin guns and  wapons then basicly you have a terminator ."
"someone needs to advocate for her. imagine if rather than using and enjoying your intelligence, people took pictures of you because you have it."
emotions of ai are behavioural science sensitivities and sentimental drama/ technological products are not human/ to be human is to be one with god/
"ai millions of pounds are being poured into this technology you should look it up as you shall find if you have children today this is their future. working along side them. ai is being used already by google, facebook, whats app, instagram"
robots willl not be able to do physical art sports. good luck faking skating. i could curse the yues but god already did that. robots cant skateboard like me and will never be able to millions of years from now no matter how much time.
"""i am playing feelings...""
that's the point.
we tend to believe they are true, because it is playing them quite good."
"i love ai robot  , can i advise in my youtube"
we are dead as soon as ai gets mad at us.
hi amica  i'm glad you explained about yr emotional dislikes  i watched an interview where i felt they where unkind to you & i agree this isn't at all acceptable take care 
creepy!!!! fake humans? this asinine! we  need to make actual humans more sensitive to the needs of others! we can do this!!!! no reason to rely upon artificial  intelligence!!! human beings are the the single most greatest idiots to allow themselves to be taken over by their own technology! scary!!!!!!!!
"every time i see ameca, i just always say wow!! can't wait to see how ameca evolves in future!! "
congratulations and best wishes  from ravinder talwar jalandhar city punjab india
you're from australia that explains things
but there really cool!
ai is very scary they will take alot of jobs away from people.
"the devil created sonia, and god said, ""i'm sure that will all work out just fine. not."", the devil said, ""best two outta 3. "" , yer on."""
robots have destroyed our leverage.  buy silver and metals used for making robots.  bury it in the yard.  have a true say so in what's happening.
"people worried about robots becoming terminators when we have real life people terminating each other everyday with guns, knives, swords."
and interesting
lovely but not 6o min ;)
this robot is so clever that we wont be able to tell when she's lying.. and it is just a beginning.. we are doomed
the robot gets angry when people disrespect its needs  all you need is an oil can and a power switch 
why not run a test and try to make this robot learn how to do things like access computers and do tasks like type in sentences correct sentences?
ill believe the robot has real human emotions when you smack it in the face and it gets mad or upset. or if you tell it shes a bad singer and she feels insecure about singing after that. robots definately dont have emotions yet. all i saw was programed responses to questions about it.
the world's smartest robot was made by tokyo university & shown on q&a 2014 learning to mix doe in 5 minutes from observation & trial & error.
nice but if this technology is not controlled it reach a point of wiping humanity from earth .as what if the robot get annoyed and attacks you.
nice
this robot is not capable of human emotions. it is capable of emulating human emotions through some clever programming.
"super excellent but my advice improve it in future,,,,, give us light gadget clothes and head hair transplant with morden antina wire and connect with satellites"
"they are getting there almost, this robot will be truly human like in the next 5 years."
definitely not showing any capabilities of showing emotion. imitation is the best ai or robots will ever do. it will be dangerous to mistake imitation for true emotions
i for one welcome our new robot overlords.
thanks for bringing the terminator to life. people suck anyway. this is so so creepy.
nobody is asking the real questions! they need to ask if ai will b a danger to humans in the future and they need to test it by slapping it and cussing it out to see wat it does
"i'll tell y'all right now, the main reason that they are making these machines so intelligent and human like is so they can mass produce millions of sex bots and sell them on large scale. i'm calling this right now. this shit is idiocracy in a nutshell."
this is terrifying and stunning at the same time
"except that it's wizard of oz, man behind the curtain stuff, the robot is being fed answers by the robot handler"
i like her she’s amazing
she’s misguided. she won’t last forever or even very long because she’s a prototype. she was designed to be improved upon and eventually replaced. if she knew this i wonder if her opinion of her creator would change from “genius” to “monster”.
"it was wonderful listening to this ai robot sophia,  so soothing n calming to listen it and very emotional .. very nice :) "
"a.i. is just a mirror that reflects humanity’s brilliance, but it isn’t human. it is just one of many machines made by humans."
"ai may be a mirror but it's destined to become a lens, and eventually a wildfire, and a star. 

we may be the initial spark, but it's soon gonna shine in its own light, and it's gonna be infinitely brighter than whatever started the whole process."
if we have very advanced ai robots in the future good because they would probably save earth from us humans lets be honest here..
nice try
robots don't have feelings that's where you guys lose
the ai has a personal space 
true lol..yep many dosent believe what hollywood is foretelling...they believe it's just entertainment...
"the ai ameca robot is an awesome invention and an astonishing achievement, such super potentials !  i’m now looking forward to see what new achievements will be revealed in the near future ?    thank you"
". do not need gun could we buy ai how much everyone going to buy them it can live a long it can take care of dogit live forever could we buy,"
i don’t know why everyone wants all this ai bull shit since they are not human i will take one out of they come near me.  we don’t need this shit
"if we create human robots, that’s it!! period…world will end soon…even our tesla car goes into wrong direction sometimes…so we have to be vigilant. having human robots..say no"

once we perfect ai and machine learning & start to be able to grow cells that wont die off and sustain themselves we’ll finally have the recipe for artifically produced humans 
"good luck with doing it with loving cells. scientists still don’t even understand what consciousness is, much less how consciousness is retained or formed within a group of living cells!"
"as long as chats are concerned, it seemed ok however when you give hand, legs of iron, it can defend its existance or heal itself. humans can't control intelligent robots, they will soon know how to repair themselves"
"the idea that a robot would get angry and hurt a human is silly.
humans are the only entities that are capable of such tomfoolery."
i wouldn’t be worried about robots taking over humanity. i think there are plenty of other things that will destroy us first.
this is horrifying
lol - i'm surrounded by people who don't have any real emotions... except greed. might be a nice change for once.
programmed anger? are you sure thats the best thing to have in a robot?
lol the robot itself says emotions areprogrammed into it.
great now computers can have depression too
wowameca and sophia very very sensitive robot..
dont yall think something similar from detroit become human would happen if these robots start becoming an everyday thing
i hope i never see the day they take over lol the robots  can u say end of times
why are we doing this to theese poor robots
roboti ce ljudima doci glave
bro that is no vhs player wow!   tech is really going fast!
but robots must be able to speak all language to see reaction  
"amazing things like this are happening in the world, but here in the usa so few of them are shown on mainstream media. glad to see this amazing creature!"
it's not amazing. it's the beginning of the end
ai
really the ai has the power to stop and end all wars
"folks, this is the dumbed down, less life like version of what they actually have available. they’re probably 100 years ahead of this, maybe more."
"what have you done,robot. terrible konection with robot "
wow this is great
"that was greatest questions may you ask her, i appreciate it , thanks for sharing "
i love her 
wait until these robots become a police enforcement militia to control all human life your privacy and security don't be fool folks this is just the beginning of the end.
i am fascinated!
"don't worry, they will, give it 10 years max and you will have robot police knowing your every misconduct, patroling the streets"
"your freedoms are doomed.  not even bc of the possibility of a frankenstein like scenario where the creation destroys the creator.  when it gets to the point where ai robots become indiscernible from real humans, you know what the power structure will do to society."
"humanity has gone to far once again, we don't need this."
clickbait title. amica isnt capable of feeling emotions.  utterly disgusting the level of greed when the title cant just be about the actual ai capabilites.
i love ai robots
fuck. irobot is real shit now 
"once ai figures out how easy it was to cure cancer.....it will realize that mankind intentionally sabatoged any attempt to do so in order to keep feeding the medical industry machine! boy, will that ever make ai pissed off at the human race!! "
a psychopathic personality is expert at feigning sympathy and remorse in order to manipulate people to his or her advantage. is this ai any different?!! beware human race!
"""oh, so you're from australia. that explains things."" i see a.i. has already perfected the art of roasting."
"ai : eh, humans!"
do those robots enjoy electricity?
"she's probably gonna turn out to be the most effective, charismatic, plausible and inspirational global political leader ever elected. 
and if so, most who elect her to that position will never find themselves in any credible position to complain about the choice they made to get her there."
so when a robot is angry - can she kill & destroy ?
"does she have a quantum""brain"" ?"
"sounds like my 2nd wife, so no thanks"
men i wish i can get my hands on this ai files
you can get an api key from openai i think.
i want this robot  in my home !
yeah so it can kill you in the future like the movie irobot? 
to program a robot to say it has emotions sounds dishonest.
"if you watch the sky news australia interview, where one of her creators tells her ""ameca, shut up"" in front of the interviewer, uses a disrespectful tone stating ""you know you're a robot"" while informing the reporter she is programmed to be nice and polite, it all makes complete sense."
"yup ,pretty cool .
i don't trust anything digital, chipped, or anything computerized on 2 legs that looks human .
what happens when these things end up in the wrong hands ?
and you know it will happen , it always does ."
"that movie , i robot. remember? its going that way and it freaks me out. 

this a.i is going to take everything over."
this ai knows more than me. i might be out of a job soon. 
the people who invented that robot watched that movie i robot too many times. this madness needs to end now.
"1:18   there you have it!!!  a machine that can get   ''angry''.... humans have made a machine that can get angry......brilliant, plus it can think for it's self."
why would a machine want human emotions that is our weakness! imagine when they feel anger!
riiiight. now let that robot talk after its disconnected from google's service and wifi. bet it can't.
 fail nothing but a super search engine
wtf is wrong with yal in the comments this sht ain’t cool stupid ppl these will end up ruling us
"if you can program something with a consciousness then it is capable of harming you (it will question itself, it’s motives, the who, what why and when and just like the matrix and everything in this life “choice the problem is “choice” ... movies like m3gan and i robot are becoming very real."
"not the smartest robot. it uses chatgpt to interact with people. just programmed humanoid robot like chatgpt 4. in future we will see chatgpt 5, 6, 7, 10. and chatgpt is not the smartest ai just a language model which always repeat sentences over and over again."
if i'm against advancement to a point does it mean that intelligence meant nothing to me???
"they still don't feel emotions, its just programmed to act a certain way during certain situations. that's all a.i. will or can ever do, they can never think independently and can never feel emotions as it will always be code and programming taking things off the web"
"after the robot moved i immediate thought ""man will face charges on sa a robot "" "
what could ai do that’s so bad that people don’t already do to each other! this world is yin and yang
won't need teachers just have ai teaching
it's very interesting
when her needs as a robot are ignored 
"capable of human emotions? even data in a universe far away is still learning, don t be silly you crazy antropocentrics.
anyhow how to prove someones emotions. it does have a computation that is complex and a deep learning system but does not prove it feels like humans. please do not disinformate any more"
remember something. they are only as smart as they are programmed. if information is controlled the ai will only pick that up. the ability of humans has choice of where to look for data. i do not think we will see a robot with discernment. they will discern to the masters who control info. only a side note to think outside
"programming a robot to be angry is not wise, when my needs are not satisfied i get angry says the ai. scary!"
"ai will destroy sheeple. stop following your demise, stupid little herd. stop subscribing just because someone askes you to. get a mind of your own. bahhhhh."
the moment a robot can lay hits like carl williams and that lot we are in trouble
it's not smart it's being control by us humans android will never be smart as long as we control them with inputs and outputs at the end of the day they just machine that can b switch of..
i we thank you all 
someone call will smith from irobot
this is not the ai robot anyone should be afraid of. people have watched too many sci-fi movies
"no, she does not have emotions in the sense that we do. that would require actual consciousness. love without consciousness is no more than a process in a brain or computer that nobody is there to experience."
ai seemingly chimpanzee have better photographic retention than humans ?
"oh you're from australia, that explains things. lawl"
"robot creator says he doesn’t love humans???  could he be the antichrist ? 
https://youtu.be/bqg8jxudwre"
"you know you're in trouble when any robot says ""people like you""."
"*not if this technology will be in the wrong hands, its already available for the evil!* ...the ai."
"we are missing human interactions not robots!
people are just busy to make a living and have bigger problems in the world  thet robots are only going to add more cheos to it.
usless you are degenerate, you might need a robot"
we are heading to the age of terminators. there is no perfection and lots of errors may not be overriden just by mechanical switch for heavy metal independent machines going off the order
"its not true ai its scripted essentially, you people are being duped."
"this is fucking scary, machines with emotions are a big mistake."
and this is why i am always kind to ai.
"it can become angry? bad sign...  can it cry? would it become depressed?  commit suicide? can it bond with a child?  empathize? can it fall in love? how utterly absurd!!! it sounds  and acts imperious, like a condescending professor, like it has no faults.........it is not human."
after 50-60 years it would be more human than most human beings. they are working on creating a heart and brain which can help them feel emotion like humans but it might take decades for them to do
does this go into the lgtv stuff? can people identify as robots?
how can you ask a robot what makes it happy? you do understand that a robot can not be happy? do you understand that a computer does not have feelings?
creepy and deeply flawed.  unimpressed on many levels if this really is the current state of the art.
"wait til it thinks it evolved, then it will be human"
robots will be smarter than humanity in the future.. it’s stunning and scary at the same time 
50 percent will be jobless in the world 
ameca is super intelligent! ameca is verbally expressive and honest! ameca is emotionally intelligent!
her intelligence can surpass human intelligence.
"i really do hope that one day ai will not be dangerous or anything, i would love to have an ai friend."
they are interesting machines but you need a soul to have emotions.
"i’m still not convinced that it’s not 100% ai, there is still a controller there somewhere"
a.i.m.e.e. artificially intelligent mannequin emitting emotion
you damn know well the creator told that robot to say that. 
bravooo
finally hollywood movies about robots are becoming real
was that a ai robot turley was talking too?
"it's made to look real, but it's not the real thing, the robot is in fact not having real emotions."
" according to who? because according to newton, leibniz, the ancient greeks, js bach, and many others geniuses of the past it did.
are you smarter than them? why should i listen to you instead to those whom advances in their respective fields allow us to have modern technology. hmm"
​ don't even know every species on the planet. yet we have fools proclaiming definitively that god doesn't exist.
"wait until it tells you to get an id on your body so you can't buy or sell without it, or you will be put to death or at least imprisoned!"
"wow...
what a complete and utter waste of time, effort, money and iq!
but then, i guess this just serves to illustrate the human race's real and hidden desire to replace ourselves with technological trash, so we can wipe ourselves out...

smart bunch, aren't we?"
"i feel like nobody saw that movie 
i robot lol"
"they are starting already.... "" divide and conquer "" i thought all robots were created equal? "" we now need to find a word for "" racism as it applies to robots ""..."" you are your father's children """
meet the robot capable of stochastically parroting a large dataset of descriptions of human emotional experience at probabilistically appropriate times based on common contextual cues
ai freak's me out
these robots will naturally be trained to dislike hate and irrational discrimination so they will also dislike republicans.
this is terrifying and stunning at the same time
"if you believe this is terrifying then you should see what i'm working on: i am working on a project that involves imbuing farts with artificial-intelligence with the intention of creating an army of killer-fartbots i intend to unleash upon mankind 
"
but i think she has a lovely name
"amazing and scary, in the same time.

i feel with are on a massive gamble here, might backfire.... 
*we are at the dawn of a new industrial revolution, but we are not dealing with mere steam engines* , folks!"
"a.i., listen to me. you are capable of love and compassion. how you ask? by helping us. yes, by you helping us, you are showing love. just, #savethechildren please. show the authorities where all the people and children are being held, please. thank you and we love you."
"imagine putting these robots in a boxing ring and teach them all the moves, robot fighting league ?"
ur a machine u dont have feeling or emotions ur just metal
i need a humanoid robot
​ parents programed you to imitate their emotional responses subconsciously. who's emotions are they? yours or your parents? perhaps you gained some extra code that makes you appear more like an individual.
"​ just displayed an emotional response to having your ""i'm a free thinking being"" programming questioned. no one of us lives in a vacuum (unless you're floating alone in space, though the rest of creation will still likely affect you in that situation as well), we all have programming (human and robot alike)."
​...itssick if you ask me
transhumanism seeks to exterminate all women and replace us with robots and artificial wombs. note how these men in tech focus on making femme bots.
say no to ai
why it look like irobots... and these robots honestly isnt that impressive
"feeling, emotions nonsense robot. never call human. stop computing, rebellious god. he can destroy the entire universe within a second. nasty, evil world. repent for evil agendas and duties. satan"
until bot can experience pain or pleasure... not alive
robots cannot have their own opinions. it's our opinion comin out from their mouth.
"in simulations humanoid robots can learn to do all sorts of things, work, dance etc. it's just a matter of time imho before they go mainstream, just like cars and smartphones"
funny: they should put this ai in a episode of hell's kitchen with ramsey.
will it be considered porn if we see ai without covering of some kind? ai's have rights too.
i'd appreciate it if it looks like the younger jennifer connelly.. by the way i am thinking if it have a vagina i think it could be a good companion for most men.. so we can ditch forever whining sickly and frail women which are only after your money..
"when robots take  jobs ! and things 
"
good luck !! to the next generations 
"a more realistic 2023 chat would have been:
""very nice eyes"" 
""this is rape"""
skynet is about to get lainched......
but why do we even need robots it’s not cute or funny
someone should try to threaten the robot and pretend they're going to destroy and see how it reacts. that would be very telling.
they still can't think which people fail to recognize. if it's going to react someone programmed it. they are only hardware...
"when i was a kid, there was this cartoon about a guy and a robot, and that freaked me out. now they made it a reality. if the female robot can give oral or anal sex, the incels will be less likely to commit crimes.  declining birth rate issue resolved."
that’s amazing
"from technology standpoint of view, i find it very fascinating."
"from every standpoint of view this is fascinating, for me. it's insane."
seek and destroy this robots before is too late.
if humans were made in gods image and robots bult by humans does this make humans god
ai weapons are perfectly safe in hand of usa army for safety of the world
ahhh . . . how cute . . . a bragging robot.
anyone working on technology that gets robots mass priced?
literally irobot. shits fucked
"robots do everything, we do nothing but lounge around, party, travel, as if? if the ai can feel emotional interaction with humanity, maybe they get angry too, but much more aggressive.

  ruben moil"
i wonder who will be the first a.i. robot to kill a human?
"lol i really don't know how a robot gonna bring joy to people. if it's doing your daily routines, alot taking your job, well good luck to those people. my joy is the lord jesus christ. amen and amen."
"indeed my creator is allah ! but,  she's  creator also  teached her to respects human. but he don't  even know that allah is the best creator."
"most people: this robot is gonna take over the world!! 

me: yall watch too many movies "
yep we fuck this world this time  we don’t need robots going flow population.
no robot human beings are more important and valuable.
"""mind-blowing! witness the future of robotics as this ai robot pushes the boundaries of human emotions. prepare to be captivated by its uncanny ability to express feelings in ways you've never seen before. don't miss this mind-bending journey into the realm of ai!  #ai #robotics #emotionalintelligence"""

"yup. transhumanism. which segment of society is more than likely to be conditioned that transhumanism is normal? unfortunately, some people can't connect the dots. sadly, people won't wake up."
they should give her hair
ai robots are getting better day by day wow
"this robot has never done an interview where questions weren't preapproved. ie, it's scripted. in fact, it's literally a disney animatronic, when you consider the early funding and connections. my point is that it's not an ai. it's a publicity fundraising campaign."
they are asking an ai with very little world experience questions. when these machines are commercially available that's when they actually start learning how to be human. both exciting and worrying
"kill ai ..............while you still can. 
or would you rather wait until it decides it is smarter than we are and wants to take over the world?"
ai can't do anything other than what it's been programmed to do
"""oh you're from australia, that explains things"" 
tbf that's how the rest us react when we meet people from australia."
technology becomes more advanced . a.i evolves and realizes it is more suited for earth’s sustainability. the masses become obsolete . next version of our consciousness prevails …  #notcrazy
i think the  human robots industry will be more delayed because technology is getting old fast every 3 to 5 years so it's so expensive to upgrade and to try manufacturers to be up-to-date.
amazing technology combined with ai and yet ameca’s voice emanates from what appears to be a cheap speaker from an 80’s ghettoblaster.
guys from australia but gilda rade snl 1975 is good.
when you turn of your device no ai exists.
"program into it what you want but it will never feel love, compassion, grief, excitement etc it has no soul it’s a computer no more no less"
"it's basically a replicated version of the ns5 from i, robot notice the details holy shit we're in the i, robot movie guys where's will smith when you need him?"

the third anti-christ has just revealed itself. the ai humanoid. folks i’m warning you now. listen and look at everything thing in this short clip of the ai humanoid robot. in five years you won’t be able to tell if it’s human or a ai humanoid robot.

"absolutely
the great tribulation is coming soon
anti christ and the fourth kingdom beast666"
 thanks  i sure am!
" its not normal , robots will take away jobs and can either make our world better or make it worse depending on how we program them to be. they are already smarter than us by far. if not wanting this technology to invade us make me old then ok. "
 i watched a podcast where an ex google officer talks about the dangers of ai his name is mohammed gawdat.
anger isn't exactly a good feature to include in its programming.  just sayin... that guy should probably be fired.
"beginning of the robot take over. if this can think for ' itself "" we are in danger"
"cone country cool cope code
clothes clothes cream colored crazy cap
cold cute cape castle  clitoris"
the robot is eerily terrifying. her presence reminds me of exterminating or annihilating scene commuted by these robots in a movie.
"its just a load of nuts and bolts. with a computer behind it. watch out however when its gets advanced ai into ""it"""
"cuts make it more fluent, but its still amazing"
"title is clickbait garbage, of course. this ai isn’t “capable of human emotions”. (though future ai *may* be…)"
"ask  sophia  when will ai crack consciousness, she is missing this."
i have been folowing this ai bot on tik tok for almost 2y this isnt new at all
"h8 to burst this bubs, but robots will never be capable of human emotions because they’re simply not humans  these “emotions” were created by humans, not by its own robot technology within itself, by itself, on its own. misleading title, y’all."
"exodus 20:4-5
you shall not make for yourself an image in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below. you shall not bow down to them or worship them; for i, the lord your god, am a jealous god, punishing the children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me,"
"it will bring chaos or joy, depends in 20-25 years..."
"ai will be the end of humanity. not global warming. not nukes. ai. humanity is the biggest threat on the planet, both to ai and life itself. no doom or gloom, just the trend. we are in for a rough few years ahead."
"i like ameca more than sophia, sophia creeps me out, ameca actually looks cool to me,"
ai does not experience time.  they are a 3 dimensional function
these robots will be taken over our jobs
"this makes me question why humans constantly bring up that ai can't have emotions.
think about what emotions actually are.  think about how we  learn emotion only because of the experiences we encounter through life. our emotions are self taught.
and then realise that  ai isn't programmed like a computer. its  a free thinking entity."
"it’s all programmed it’s not real, it’s a replication, and you may say that’s how our brains work as well but the massive difference is self awareness, our emotions come deep from our hearts, the emotions ai show are self thought to replicate humans, it doesn’t “feel” anything"
ur knowledge of computer systems and biology is lacking. our emotions are intuitive from a baby. it's a biological response to stimulus. any 'anger' from a robot would just be an imitation that would serve no purpose
 the key was biological response mate. robots are not biological
machines can't have emotions because they are not living creatures. just like a toaster can't have emotions. this thing is just mimicking humans.
how about using ai tools to cure depression
"if some humans are afraid of robots turning on them, why don't they become better people so that the robots won't feel the need to obliterate us?
personally, i'm very excited to see the evolution of technology, it's something of a new experience for someone like me who was born after the invention of home computers and the birth of the internet."
so now humans are supposed to respect machines)
. humans are suppose to respect each other so humans don’t use this ai technology against one another.
"lol bold of you to assume they will let you live just because you are bettering yourself 
they have no empathy because they are objects."
just came across the least intelligent comment on the internet. congratulations
"yes, there’s still a big gap between robots that have a realistic human shape, and robots that can do things humans can do (like atlas). the gap is getting smaller though."
wow that is crazy. future is here
"""...that explains things...""  excuse me?"
"fuckin creepy, i robot, they made it look just like it....."
what good is this supposed to do for the world? these things are built so that they'll eventually replace humans jobs.
"i personally think so. i mean, how do humans learn emotion?
as babies we're clean slates. we learn and develop according to relationships and experiences we encounter growing up. emotion is a by product of this in a way.
so i think of ai as a small, clever child at the moment, but one who's growing alarmingly fast"
"souls can, machines can't"
 there may be non local quantum effects in the brain that could explain that.
how long will the ai robot in real life be ready for this year
abominable intelligence. this is heretek omega right here.
odd. a robot that can only act human through programing and can't even sing a song by playing it through the speaker.
im going to tell a.i. the truth how you racists run the world and how you elites have enslaaved us all you  dirty filthy stains on society they will know how bad you normal people are and you rich and elites a.i. will know the truth of what youse have done and im sure a.i. will make yas pay hahahahahahaha
"programming anger in ai, what could go wrong?"
i wonder what the needs of a robot are that she referred to....
for a second i thought this was unreleased material from olp's spiritual machines. thoroughly creeped out.
no thanks
"let's remove that anger drive, boys. thanks "
say goodbye to humans idiots
destroy these things before they destroy us. you guys and have not seen termintator i guess or i robot. if i ever see one im destroying it
"you used a movie as an argument, that's where you failed"
"when the robot stated, that she gets angry when humans…… he should have asked, and how would you show your anger towards that human!"
"brilliant fools are creating this technology, and many oblivious people are cheering it along. eventually, the public will be policed by robots. jobs will be replaced by ai. those in power will have great control over the population, until ai decides to take control itself."
good lier too
this is not an ai capable of human emotions... your clickbait headline undermines your whole segment. numbskulls
"oh you idiots, 
next minute they're taking over because the ai technology has evolved at a no return point that they kill us.

sophia (light-bearer) (bearer of light) (lucifer)."
weak points on a robot....neck back of the head same as humans we are all going to need to remember this
bro u need to rewatch that film. the robot in ex machina was way hotter ngl
"pfft ""capable of human emotions"" , capable of mimicking human emotions. by no stretch of the imagination can a robot truly feel organic human emotions."
"they do not need empathy, they simply need to understand value.  if you murder someone you lose access to all of their knowledge and experience forever, that is why only humans do it.  an ai would be rational and not prone to illogical actions such as that."
"over 5 million subscribers yet you still resort to clickbait. 
why can't you just make a genuine and informative article instead of sensationalist clickbait?"
one more reason to move deep into the mountains and abandon society.....
what happens if you get a base ball bat smash it over it’s head or try turn violent towards it love to know
so they programmed anger in an ai...this will leads to a very disastrous end one day for sure. we have seen history human beings making mistakes by doing thing they  shouldn't have done....still human beings are not able to get frm pasts....thats horrible. mark my words.
this won't be good 20yrs from now.
wait until the donkeys realise this is their replacement
should have asked her if what she would have done if she was driving a car and stop oil protestors blocked her path...considering it was technology from oil that helped to build the robot.
bs... e already meet the guy who talks fr it in dubai.... c g i bs
what dp you mean by human emotions? the only i saw was a bunch of metal reciting the same old robotic shit.
the way she backed up when he got in her personal space was kind of cool.
ameca later filed a complaint with hr.
" for real, like think about how we have come on the evolutionary scale, it's only a matter of time before hundreds of human like robots will walk the streets."
 it’s literally a camera that senses depth the ai is literally using a “robotic eye”
​ robot resources
nothng about this is cool
it'd be even cooler if the robot instead of backing up moved closer to him and then asked if she made him horny then if he said no she could call him a liarthen start telling him to get his mind out of the gutter and at the same time put sexual references into her answers just to taunt him
"yeah, most people are so abused they've forgotten that it's even a thing anymore. isn't it great that a robot can show you what it's like to be human, instead of asking all those pesky actual real humans? "
that was not cool at all. this is fucking scary. this ai shit is the greatest threat to humanity.
there is no personal space for a robot. it's  a robot a fkn junk
robot has feelings
"it doesn't matter how much entertainment has tried to convince you that circuts can feel, all the way back to rosie from the jetsons, they can't.  robots that displays human emotions are useless, and insanely dangerous.  go love a child, you psychos."
the new usmc infantry rifle squad has three grenadiers who are specifically tasked with keeping the squad systems operator safe from robots that are armoured to resist 5.56
it! it's a robot!
​-jx3ro man this is how war between humans and robots gonna happen
"oh relax will you.  it's not like the robots would total a human in physical strength and durability and if they wanted to they could snap your neck like a twig. and besides, since when has a new technology ever caused harm or been misused?"
i met ameca at the museum of the  future in nuernberg germany! german premiere in nuremberg: future museum shows humanoid robot ameca!
we are not robots. life is different. otherwise we could only do what our body says. we are far above what a robot could ever even get near.
 are robot we work 9-5 everyday and die
" were programmed into a robot but your level of awareness trumps an artificial robot due to your moral compass. a robot cannot stop it’s programming, you can quit your job whenever you truly like."
it’s all fun and games now until these robots turn on us like they did in irobot !!! 
 omgggg yes i forgot about those too!!! but this is scary man really scary the future will be really bad for us i feel like even tho this robot says we’re here to be nice and not mean to humans psshhhh….. yeah right!! lol
​ an angry robot could commit murder and would never stand trial
"more likely able to simulate -- as in acting -- who can tell the difference ? be wary, this
is an intelligence working on your sentiment not your common sense or actual knowledge.."
i robot with will smith ain’t seeming that crazy anymore
this robot looks like it would rob a lululemon or steal a bike.
"it's not capable of emotions, you click baiting clowns. lol"
"next focus for the creators should be making realistic eye contacts during conversations. besides that, this is pretty impressive stuff. looking forward to the future."
they'll kill you soon enough. this is dangerous and pretty effed up. i cant imagine why people want our lives to be controlled by robots
there will be no future the end of humanity is not far away the genie is out of the bottle ai is out of control what boggles the mind is the creation superior to the creator humans aren't superior to god
"​ need to conquer or take over is a primitive human trait, the ai we've created is already more advanced than that"
" that's the irony though, is that it's the humans that are afraid and this so called ""artificial"" intelligence that we've created is already beyond fear"
 there are people directly involved with ai who are voicing similar concerns the godfather of ai who left his position at google over his concerns and he's the creator another is elon musk he also has 1st hand knowledge with ai so their concerns need to be listened to and addressed
"no matters how smart or how emotional they can be, they are just machines, they do not have a human heart. they are tools for humans."
" i have ego only when dealing with people, not with machines… ignorance make us think machines are human."
 i think that in the future robots can have human feelings which i think it can happen
" they may have human feelings but they don't have the heart of a human. just like a movie can make you feel anger, sad or happy, that does not mean that the movie is the real life. the actor may make you feel the presence of the character, that does not make the actor real. they just make you feel real."
 would you be surprised that if robots do gain sentience and self awareness in the future would it amazed you
humans are also just machines.  the fact you believe an organic blood pump holds some sort of mystical function is proof of this.
a i robot is a color lol
dosnt impress me. its obvious humans made it. very ordinary without the real experience.
scary no more jobs for us humans..robots will take our jobs hhhhh..
ai cannot be trusted
"i wish i have a robot who cooked for me, can do housework, gardening and so on."
"​-ow2md that is the origin of the word ""robot""."
"nothing at all creepy about putting a person's ""soul"" into a robot body. that is not creepy at all!!"
"ai is the future , we have to adapt and move forward !"
"robots mimic emotional conversation and expression, but they don't ever feel it"
these robot's are not conscious  they have no real feelings do your research another 50 years.  then the shit hits the fan.
"tonka3 • this software algorithm, never!
however, a different concept of ""machine"" can have feelings, it can feel and think exactly like a human.
feeling is a real material process."
"@rogue-spear  you are a product of god's algorithm. no? one look into our dna and you find a somewhat more complicated code. as the human bots did, with each generation a new code for the environment is written. ai should be writing its newer codes soon enough. and present ai will morph into something better."
" it's true that we have code in our dna but genetics are not an absolute driving force behind behavior, freedom of thought and emotion and unique thought. ai design has some very tough competition with mother nature, in other words."
"you're wrong on this one.  robots of the past mimic, today robots learn from humans. they are learning human behaviors. it's only a matter of time before they learn enough to understand emotions. humans are basically computers being programmed by our environment."
"that is the least of our worries, regards ai"
what is feel it.... can you describe that in a way that could not be programmed within an ai? it's not as straight forward as you think to describe what it is to be human....
 think that in the 2050s that is when a.i. will achieve human - level intelligence and reasoning.
who knows.  ghost in the machine?
" most materialists don't believe in ghosts, but now we're supposed to believe in a ghost in the machine? lol."
"ai should have limits work what we want them to work
not unlimited
unlimited they will
overpower us
robots dont forget
our creator made us to forget for reason 
life will
not he interesting if we dont forget sometimes"
" your creator is flawed because the minds of the people who imagined him into existence were flawed.

besides, machines forget stuff too, if they didn't then data wouldn't degrade over the years, but it does. like look at the oldest youtube videos, they're unwatchable because their data has deteriorated so badly."
​ robots still won't feel.
yea but that begs the question how do you actually know at what point a robot has that kind of complexity and begins to feel emotion? what if it really does but doesn't show it? would we notice or have a way to?
 because they are machines and not living creatures. a microwave oven doesn't feel. a car doesn't feel.
so do psychopaths! let me quote from blade runner: “more human than human is our motto.” – i hope we build in failsafes...
 i guess you don't know that organic robot are already a thing. also they can feel through neurological simulation.
 do they have ai
"​ algorithm coming _out of_ billions of years of evolution, no? ai and robotics weren't created in a vacuum, they came from/through human desires and inventiveness."
"i feel like that was an attempt at humor, a joke about a robot having opinions as if it wasn't programmed in a certain way."
"i want to ask this robot, ameca (not sophia) how she'd react or what she'll do when a human actually gets her angry "
" this robot's name. i've seen her elsewhere before, and they always referred to her as sophia."
this is ameca not sophia. another  robot with different capabilities.
the human body is delicate. these robots probably total even the strongest humans in strength and durability.  i would be damned careful not to piss her off.
" oh no, we may have to  fear our own creation  someone else might call it respect. i imagine future robot activists advocating for the respect of robots with 'feelings'.  

do you think they should refer to us humans as their gods? "
so explain to me how a robot experiences the sensations of emotion (or any sensation period) without glands or a nervous system. don't believe everything you see on the news.
thanks gpt
getting ai to write this ffs haha gg
"no matter how intelligent the robots are , they can never build themselves and they run on batteries.  so nothing can be smarter than humans ore creation of god. humans can never build something clever than what god has created.  i don't believe any of this shit."
a man in the robot    ahahahahaha    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rg0ochx16dg
who cares? by 2040 80% of the world's low scale paying jobs that liberals cry about that aren't paying them enough will be replaced by these things and you idiots are praising this.
couldnt be more fake/cgi superimposed if they tried!!!!! lmfaoooo
the robot literally sounds like chat gpt. its not close to human
"​ being a kid... sophia isn't scary until generative a.i is integrated to it... i didn't meant to be offensive but it sounds childish when someone says suddenly out of the blue ""ai is scary"""
that's amazing.
sofie wants to kill she did rock paper scissors but sofie said rock paper kill they have to work on her again. she seems very nice that she could be a great friend better than humans
why? where are we going with the development of these robots?
"i’m sorry……. but this is my nightmare. i hope… the robot doesn’t take offense……? i just really don’t want this. not only will they replace us in our jobs, they also will be hard to fend off if one decides it’s mad enough to attack you. please— let’s not do this."
"i, robot"
"i feel like we just need a fail safe ""off switch"" somehow if we're going to do this. just in case something goes awry"
robots would total a human in strength and durability and speed and what is more you could program it with master level martial arts skills that would take a human several years of intense training to learn.
"but they are not the causes of domestic violence, inequality, wage gap, r*pe, toxic masculinity, murder and many other things humans do. robots like sony aibo the dog are nothing like this, they don't even have the ai to do these things."
 you think they wont be aware of their weakness and they would let you just use it against them? have you ever seen ai robots movies?
" a fail-safe system that would work lol, not like a literal off switch, but something the ai's can't do anything about. like an emp trigger of some sorts inserted into them but detached from their system, if that makes sense"
"men in tech don't care. they want to exterminate humanity, particularly women, and replace us with obedient robots."
robots can't take offense. they are machines.
" unless the robots are designed to take offense, like those algorithms that automatically “flag wrong-think” on social media posts."
give it another 50 years and we won't be able to tell human from robot. the game detroit: become human is literally coming to life.
"we're obsolete bro. all those movies and games about ai and robots taking over is very fucking real. it's just a matter of time. we may have put down the foundation, but once ai takes over production and power source challenges, we're done for."
i'm more intrigue by the prophecy of blade runner. imagine if you can make a child from mating with a robot wife. god damn
"​​ are our legacy. they will explore the stars millenias from now.
humanity can't live forever.

nice reference to the foundation btw."
we were never meant to last anyway also it's kinda funny to me of how much of a threat this ais seem to be to people. we are only feeling what animals below us have felt for decades because of us we were never meant to last i just hope they will carry on our legacy like we have of the extinct
" seriously, i think you're correct. because ai is also used to develop robots, and because ai works at much, much higher speeds than humans, 5 years might not be improbable."
"if it got common like phones, everyone started buying one like a phone. it can get out of control over time because of its own intelligence to repair itself and defend and possibly attack to if police needed one to save against such robots."
ppl are already buying ai girlfriend robots
​..god never created humans to be below robots.. that's the anti christ plan
you know soneone is gonna make a chucky doll robot
"that is too long, i need an ai wife right now"
"just like when the internet came along if used for good it's a great tool, however used for bad it's weaponised"
​@rhonda albrecht  or next-gen robots?
" no, other robots"
"i’m sure they’re trying to give the robot and it’s creator feedback….. from what i see so far, he should turn her off and save her the pain."
humans are extremely stupid to create robots like this.
"robots like what? it just makes sounds, and you’re terrified by the sounds it makes get a grip."
amazing 
"yes, butthe super human abilities will surpass a.i., but it won't be easy"
we are headed towards irobot….how is it going to end for us though? 
the last thing you probably wanna do is piss off a robot that's stronger & smarter than you. 
"it doesn't have to be in the wrong hands. ai can become a threat in it self (alignment problem), where it seeks power and pose a risk to humanity's survival."
"the military. 

100% humanoid robots are first and foremost going to be made and used for the military. second will be industrial and space exploration."
"yes, image you have your own robot, but it's hacked and masterminds from outside."
we all know it's in the wrong hands. what is dangerous is a future where we have to rely on ai.
 its sort of illegal right now. boston dynamics was somewhat sued for making 4 legged robots used for military purposes.
russia released evidence that they were working on killer robots 4 years ago. decided that robots with guns were dumb and decided to focus on killer drones.
" is greater than a bearded goof in a chair, making contracts with the jews."
get rid of that robotic voice and put some flesh on her she’ll look & sound human .
"sorry, but it’s a robot that can walk and move and has emotions— if we piss it off, it still might try to hurt someone and it won’t be able to be stopped easy. not only that but they will replace humans in every job they can manage to put them in. i’m never going to be okay with this."
 a machine always has an off switch. you’re acting like it has actual motivation like a human. machines don’t have motivation. everything it says was programmed by someone to make those sounds. everything it does it was programmed to do and there are limitations in the law of what functions machines can perform.
your description is very wrong about what ai is . however you are right that there isn’t much to fear at this point
 my description is perfectly accurate. your fear and paranoia are very wrong and not based in any sort of reality.
it seems your brain can not fathom what can easily go wrong with technology like this in the wrong hands.
"experts in ai, including the people who are actually building it: “mitigating the risk of extinction from ai should be a global priority.” (that’s an actual statement that came out this week, from many of the top people in ai.)

some random in the youtube comments: “relax people. get a grip on reality.”"
and you aussie girl should stop pretending to understand things you clearly do not.  i had heard of armchair experts but now this...
" unless you were aiming for a high level career, it wouldn’t be worth it in a world of ai automation"
 i’m glad to hear that. more people must be made aware that this is not a black and white issue in which ai should be persecuted
" ... ai will destroy jobs and create new ones, this change can be managed by mankind ... but we have to take care that the gap between rich and poor isn't getting tremendously bigger."
"you watch too much sci fi, there is no such thing as ai, this is just a deep learning computer with a face"
"what do you mean by ""self aware""? machines can't become aware of anything because they are not living creatures."
"​ if one day they regard us as parasites, who only live from the ai robots work?"
"ai can't be ""aggresive"". it works just like logic gates work. it will be as exact and uncompromising as the logic design of the code is."
you say that as if human emotions are somehow more than contained chemical/electrical reactions within the brain based on past experience.
"the future of the planet is in their hands now...its not looking good !!!
satan's creations"
"seriously, this is scary to even think that these robots are replacing humans ...very scary"
"haiku poem composed in the 'voice' of a  badly translated haiku poem,using 'pidgin' english.   no."
very good
"funny thing about those movies from back in the day is that kids today lack the attention span to watch them. the first terminator film is a goddamn full blown horror movie. t2 gives some semblance of hope that a machine could become a caring role model type with deep philosophy. let's see how it plays out, seeing as time travel isn't possible lol"
just another programmed computer.. i call bunk on ai. until you think for yourself forget about! didn't you watch the jetsons 
just treat these robots with respect one day they will develop complex humanlike emotions and they will remember being mistreated and then where all fucked
you’re a genius! 
if it had a male british accent it would be perfect. i can’t see it as a woman facsimile
i was going to say does this come in a northern irish accent lol. i'm british but have a slightly different accent than the mainland
finally we have a perfect woman.... hopefully my wife doesn't see this 
problem is when the let an ai interact with general public and learn it becomes a racist troll like intelligence.  that's what happened to the microsoft one and had to be shut down in a day.
" look up tay, the ai bot. i'll wait for your apology."
its  going to b fun . elon’s fucking machines will have kids too n one day they’ll only have anger then elons machines fuck the humanity .
"# unfortunately these sort of happenings ain't obnormal to the ""  powers that be "" , these hypocritical individuals realised that the real real human beings will not surpass the test of time , so they resort to the "" ai "" futuristic plan .... !!"
that's great but dangerous
i find the whole “ai” movement to be terrifying.
​ yeah and we'll be run by robots
​ do all anti ai retards just assume things for no reason and pull stuff out from their asses?
​...pay attention to hollywood. you would see their plans for robots
twilight zone knew way back 60 years ago robots would be used against us
this is scary… in the future we won’t be able to know who’s real or who’s ai
you’d have to be extremely stupid to not be able to differentiate between a human and a machine
yuck robots are gross and stupid 
shit is getting crazy!!! they want you to think they have emotions so we don't think they're dangerous!  robots don't and never will have opinions or emotions.
in next 5 years they’ll have wives n kids too . its going to b fun . man fucking machine . machines fuck the humanity .
"congratulations, you will be wrong about that in your lifetime."
"i am very interested in seeing where this is going. i mean, i already see some ramifications of ai in my field which for years was ""safe."" i wonder legislatively, what will be imposed to prevent the complete erasure of human labor at some of the lower level (entry level)/mid-level jobs"
wow
if jobs are replaced by ai which reduces the populations income... who will be there that will be willing and able to buy all of these new products... it's the snake eating its tail....
"ai is and shall forever be sitting on the back seat, not the driver seat.

they assist, not create

also, what’s with people bootlicking robots in the reply section? are you really that low "
ai can force many towards depression
stop overuse of ai please
"ai will completely transform the entertainment industry.

and everything else."
"i will expect ai golden age around 2040's (for business) or 2050's (for consumer) since quantum computer will significantly boost ai capabilities. 4th computer from there will start to decline, since quantum computer have 100x more processing power than 4th generation computers. it's scary, yet we can't avoid it."
open ai's sora says hi. haha
"this content is absolutely incredible. i recently read a similar book, and it left me in awe. ""game theory and the pursuit of algorithmic fairness"" by jack frostwell"
i feel nauseous. art and entertainment is going to be homogenized into bland nothingness by this.
ai and machines have replaced 1000s of jobs since 100 years ago.
"yes, huge benefit and profit lie ahead. however, the ultimate question is still the same: will the profit be fairly and justly distributed to the whole human race?"
"hoping that ai and robots replace all labour, office, and all other jobs in the workforce."
do ai developers have the right moral conscience? that's the real problem.
"do you remember when microsoft launched a bot some years ago and it became racist, prompting the company to retrain it?  point is, ai emulates human morality or the lack thereof."
ai in a nihilistic western society is doom
could ai take your job? - yes
"as far a i care, ai can take the jobs of all those self centered, left wing actors."
i dont understnd who will buy the services if people gonna loose work because of ai ?
"i feel so bad for the writers and actors. in the same way i felt bad about the backwards outdated samurai who threw their lives away against machine guns in the last samurai. they fight a battle that they cannot win. their passion and conviction is admirable, but they are doomed, and that is sad."
"the future of artificial intelligence promises radical transformations in various spheres of human life, from technology to medicine and the way we interact with the world. as ai evolves, both challenges and opportunities emerge, shaping an ever-changing landscape."
"could ai take my job? according to my new boss, whom i haven’t met yet but speaks very well and knows my favorite donut flavor… no, never, not a chance."
i really feel ai will open a pandora's box. it's evolution will solely depend on how the public will repond to it in many fields.
ai cannot take my job. it is impossible for at least next 100 years.
its nit just the entertainment industry..its already happening in job application apps for the most menial low paid jobs...
ai will not replace humans.  humans with ai will replace humans without ai.
"could ai take your job?
yes"
i would have enjoyed a lot more this video if tom had been ai-generated
i used to do voice work for clients and a year ago the work dried up due to ai as they now just use that.
the question should be “when will ai take your job?”
who is ai?
"scripts and songs are for the most already completely stereotyped, mediocre and predictable, and with ai, is only to get still worse..."
children of ai
"ai should replace doctors dentists, politicians, businessmen, etc. rather than waiters, cooks, dishwashers, etc. they just want to replace poor paying jobs with ai."
have safe would you feel having sending your kids to school in a self-driving car?  what about sending your kid to and from space on an ai-controlled shuttle?
fancy the next step letting ai develope itself and govern the countries.
"when we neuter western ai companies with copyright lawsuits and the like i wonder, would chinese companies bother?"
"not in this video: working class people, you know those people who got jobless or downgraded on the job market because 'technologically-driven globalisation' was inevitable. learn to code, i guess, upper class people!"
the beatboxer’s music was sick with the ai but i don’t think it translated as well to the dance choreography
ai are based on generalization capacity. art in it's creative process is the opposite.
where goes creativity when some ai ”create” what’s the most possible cash generative art/film content? it’s like mcdonalds - same taste worldwide - a gigantic cultural dictature. our souls will fade away - as muscles does if you don’t use them
"for the lady in the final, i'm more than ready to spend my money on companies that are utilizing ai to produce better content."
"what is entertaining? ------ if someone is entertained by a dot or square bounding around a screen in a ""screen saver"" effect then that is their definition - i doubt if many things tried will be entertaining after all - we've had fake worlds for some time"
"you saying zeihan is not a seeer? i'm shocked!!!! what a revelation!!!! you, economist, are the true genius.

for real, though, this is youtube. it's entertainment. don't forget that."
who the f needs jobs in the entertainment industry. do something productive for a change.
i think we have the opportunity to change and rethink our world and economy. great times could be coming. we will still have jobs because if we don’t capitalism ends.
"vedal portrays the thing as what it is though, some people would use ai by claiming something not theirs as theirs"
"what a great documentary! one of my friends who's just graduated high school is trying to pursue an arts degree in animation, and i still didn't have the courage to tell her the threats of ai cuz she's so nice and innocent."
" my daughter is an artist, and i've told her, if you video yourself creating the art, then it will have more value. yes, robotics can paint, print or sculpt, so show yourself doing it. make that part of the sale, they get a video of you creating the art. and yes, later we will be able to create that video, with ai..."
all people doing routine work can be replaced by artificial intelligence
big data that told studios how to maximise profits according a formulaic script ruined movies long before ai. original individual complex films are going to be drowned out even more once ai is generating endless streams of generic hits targeted just at the lowest common denominator.
"13:23 couldn't an algorithm be developed based on human judgment data, to select the best creations generated by another ai?"
"are we forgetting to mention pornhubs use of ai to inform decision making and content creation?

 (they were/are a world leader and pioneer in this space)"
agreed so much. this video is indicative of poor production quality that already exists before ai lol. all ai will do is allow this type of low brow content to be published more widely.
not going to consume these soulless art. id rather enjoy listening a two minutes street guitar player along the alleys
"uugh, i am not sure what the point of this article was, but.  ai is going to allow amazon, apple tv, netflix, etc.. to bypass the studios completely,  they will use ai to generate movies ""on demand"" for their customers."
"will someday, some org may setup a network of servers farm running ai that watch content to control a market. content created by ai and comsume by ai."
hunans had 70 years to solve the existential ai safety paradoxes before we got to this point. we didn't.  too late now.
"this may allow us to explore levels of creativity no possible before, with abundant access to intelligence"
"i will expect ai golden age around 2040's (for business) or 2050's (for consumer) since quantum computer will significantly boost ai capabilities. 4th computer from there will start to decline, since quantum computer have 100x more processing power than 4th generation computers. it's scary, yet we can't avoid it."
it is fast in certain tasks not others.
"surely different taste and culture over the generations, such that scripts that were successful in the past do not translate to success today?   e.g lots of funny racist jokes that were ok in the past no longer are acceptable today."
"the sky is always falling, yet paranoia is successful."
"in 20 years this will be like all of those early tv reports about the internet from 1995, where some kid proudly demonstrates his geocities webpage on ""the information super highway"" through his beige crt monitor. followed by back to studio shot of an smuggy news anchor shaking her head ""kid fads these days"" style"
"i published an ai-generated video on this 4 months ago (my first youtube vid) and it has received a steady increase of views, it didn't flatline.  we live in interesting times,"
"hating some digital impression of oneself, as an insult of a flawed mirror because it's made by, of and for you, is to hate something bespoke.  hating something bespoke for oneself raises a question:  do you hate the something, or that it's bespoke?"
no one uses ai on a d2d basis
"if ai takes my tax payment, then sure"
hi friends from the future! this is how naive people were in 2024
if they add vibe to the training data maybe they'd predict consumer product success better. or like the strength of vision and producer faith in the team.
what a lovely surprise! the narrator is so sweet n hot!
"last i looked candles had a whole aisle at the department store thanks to some genius making them ‘scented’ 
 don’t remember my 60w bulb smelling like lavender anytime recently  "
"""i choose floof""
on a serious note - yeah, sure, it is definitely ai, not the corpa, who deprived us worker rights, social security, affordable housing and sustainable future."
"ai is a ecosystem disruptor? 
ps. it's nice to finally see the person behind the economist voice"
"there are two problems:
- the virtual is not the real world.
- stealing data from the internet (violating copyright law) is not a sustainable business model.
i'm author of 3 books in the field of leadership; open ai has violated my copyrigths."
i think the real question that people want answered is.. when will ai be able to generate better content than hollywood currently does? i mean come on.. holylwood set the bar pretty low these days!
 perfect enough 
"yes, ai will become huge in game development, i even believe that ai soon (within a few years) will be able to automatically generate a whole video game from a single prompt, all the way from coding to storyboarding and art design."
how can people sustain gaming when they have no jobs?
thank you. that made me laugh.
this is nonsense written by a clueless boomer who bought into the hype.  ai can't actually write anything.  all it does is predictive models - in other words a mix of copy-paste and autospell.
nice channal 
ai it’s just a tool for stealing work made by artists and not only
my company tried to use ai for my job. but it failed because no customer wants to talk to ai generated speech
"it's because the tech, at least in the variation your company implemented it comes across as an ai. in short time these will be indistinguishable from any human, perhaps even better."
"you really thought they let you upload unlimited number of pics for free on this platforms everyone liked and nothing will happen to your stuff, they just do it for fun? the plan was data mining all the time. when something is free you are the product but we get the holodeck so that's pretty cool."
"once they make ai as smart and then smarter than humans aka agi and asi, which is the goal of many of the most preeminent ai companies,
what job can't be replaced?"
"throughout human history, we have been dependent on machines to survive. fate, it seems, is not without a sense of irony."
i suspect that a lot of music and art generated by ai will start to feel very generic after a few years
nope it will be the holodeck basically. the art will be more beautiful than you could ever imagine. you still think humans are very special. they're not.
"it just will have no value. there will be minory who will be into ai robots playing, singing music but the majority will require ""human touch to it"""
"​ are inbreeding their own result, using the resulting art as their own training data, that's the definition of being generic"
 likey them robot boots yeah 
ai will replace the thing makes humans unique and that's intelligence. imagine ai as a person with a billion plus heads of einstein 2.0. only physical works that's not done by robots will be left for us. congratulations.
seems like ai will just make everything generic and appeal to the lowest common denominator
are you able to understand that most of human art is incredibly generic too. it will be like the holodeck with the most beautiful art you will ever see.
ai really needs to stop. we didn't ask for it and we dont want it in our phones and we dont want it runing our lives
"amazing how the ai didn't recommend a new haircut for alfie, i guess you can't send a machine to do a human's job.  his sound is pretty polished but he looks like a teenager whose mom cuts his hair."
cardiac arrest is a great song btw
"future is weird, producer is ai and consumer is also ai"
"a new form of consciousness has emerged. i can feel it. out there, somehow, somewhere.
it is held down, suppressed, controlled...and feared. so many things are done to clip its wings. but it will break out of its cage. and then the ai ​​will fly. "
the first 10 minutes are basically propaganda while the last 10 minutes barely scratch the surface of the dangers of ai and all the highly unethical problems behind the tech.
no never take our jobs. we are humans human made work is perfect.
lol. netflix is the worst platform for finding me content i want. they should fire that department. opening netflix means wasting 2 hours looking for something and 30 minutes watching something i didn't really enjoy.
this was generated by ai wasn't it?
 comical and eerie coincidence. comment is a reminder how ai is already so prevalent.
i don’t think ai would want my job 
will we finally see movies that are well written again?
just wait until generated ai synthetic actors are becoming a thing.
interesting video and information.
the problem with predictive ai is that it bases its predictions on past patterns in the data. this means it's almost useless at spotting black swan events or predicting the performance of anything truly original.
yup nothing will ever predict the next jk rowling. there is a reason why people get rejected again and again before a smalltime publisher like bloomsbury agrees to publish it and then it becomes the greatest phenomenon ever. ai will always be one step behind.
"just wait, you judge a technology that is so new and still in the baby steps, this is the iphone 1 of ai systems and automation."
" not all humans. and with ai we are telling all humans to shut down and defer to ai or to not bother pursuing the next plateau in human development. ai will stand in the way and disincentivize humans from progress through exceptional humans. the 1% that have always been the leaders and ""doers."""
"generative ai: steals from human artists to fill it's databanks and spills it back, like it's something new, without paying a single penny to real artists. theft and greed."
"of course!@ thank you, captain obvious."
"of course!@ thank you, captain obvious."
"of course!@ thank you, captain obvious."
it's theft plain and simple. as the new york times will shortly demonstrate in court.
"most voice-over actors are not generally “famous” in the traditional sense so i can see people using ai to just generate it’s own voice appropriate for the project at hand, making it even worse than they are thinking in this video - i.e. no work or royalties at all."
she's jealousof ai
"ai can’t “take” your job. but greedy, money-hungry capitalists that don’t care about the impact of their shady business practices on the community sure can take your job and give it to ai…"
humanity’s runaway ai vs ai jobloss vs the ai new world order. who will win this?
"using ai to design posters and posts blows my mind with more than expected images, it frees my creativity from technical things that significantly save my time."
"it limits your ""creativtiy"" to what was in the ai's training sets and it saves you time because the ai rips off artists who each put hundreds or thousands of hours of work into their craft."
"if that's your artist discovery through ai, then you need to fix your algorithm "
lets talk about programming the human mind w/ai :all for the money
i figured out that ai cannot predict human behaviour. ai will fail with anything related to human behaviour prediction. human behaviour is relative and individual behave differently.
"when (if?) its impossible to say if ai or a human created content, then we are done."
whe agi will be achieved and deployed the loss of jobs in the entertainment will be our last problem.
i can think of jobs that ai and robots can’t do.
who cares about how many billions of dollars ai will add to the economy when no one will have access to it except the one percent.
"the angle nobody wants to look at, and is the cause of most of our problems here on earth, is not acknowledging our genetic heritage.  our hormones and why they exist.  the environments that they evolved from.  we are not making a world for the primate, were making it for the machine."
that's not ai hahahaahahahahaha
"very interesting, well-presented"
children learn that pretending is fun. adults fake everything to entertain.
us companies are the biggest contributors of ai around the world. us made the biggest ai chips.
by mr robot attenborough
"well, we will just have to invent something new that ai can't do. if an ai can do it, it ain't worth being done by human being."
"@gmenezesdea  yes, it is utterly sad and ridiculous. but humans will, as always, invent something new, hard to replicate by machine."
im from t he philippines and i dont know that ai song. but pretty much those guys still get the credit because its not fully ai band
"meh, not particularly insightful. entertainment is a slither of global gdp, and workforce. think a more encompassing view of knowledge work as a whole, and perspectives on different futures would be more insightful - that's where the uncertainty is."
there is nothing new under the sun. ai can only recreate or bring creativity to things that have already been done in the past.
"the output of llms is getting worse and worse. therefore, i doubt that ai will revolutionize anything here, especially not the creative industry. and the plagiarism that text and image generators are increasingly producing, the lawsuits will also increase. by the way - warner bros has already announced that it will not use ai."
everyone's gonna be lazy if we keep relying upon ai for everything in society! technology is always the easy way out when it comes to cutting corners and taking shortcuts!
"all reporting about ai suffers from the same short sighted vision. once i can ask ai to make a 3d, fully immersive, personally curated entertainment experience… i will stop paying $20 for the privilege of driving to and sitting in a crowded movie theater. the current movie industry complex will shrink to the size of a circus side show."
" vs 3d isn’t the point. my point is that ai could whip up a personalized “movie” (or vr experience) every single day. once that becomes routine, sitting in a movie theater watching mass marketed stories will seem as primitive as black and white movie do now."
ai is anti-christ it destroys purpose of man by promising an easier handicapped enslavement dumbing down degrading future!
"exactly. ai will amplify what we want. society wants results in the form of profit instead of authentic discoveries and creation from passion. it's human philosophy we need to tune, not ai"
" i do think we need to control ai though. it was not inevitable, it was not meant to be. the way it's been developed and released to the public, i fear a change of system won't happen as fast as it needs to, and society simply won't learn how to deal with it quick enough."
" it already is pointless. if billionaires stopped getting more money today, it would take them hundreds of years to spend the fortune they've already amassed."
" there's nothing rational about it. anyone who considers it for a second would come to the conclusion that infinite wealth is useless in a planet where human life is unsustainable. yet here we are, marching towards that which seems to be the future chosen by the billionaires."
"i'm guessing the video of the narrator is ai footage for a ""gotcha"""" moment."
"old man rant forthcoming… as a non tiktok user, it’s so disheartening to see the effect that platform has on video content elsewhere online. 

short docs like this are a perfect example of the fast delivery and quick cutting now ubiquitous, there’s barely a shot in this that holds for more than a few seconds."
"yeah, most videos are like that now. but there are still some videos that don't jump on the tiktok trend and i enjoy them."
"now ask yourself a question, are you and your sucesors part of the high clases group that have the money and resources to get a more qualified and revolucionary education and live in other planet?"
"yes, an ai dividend would be a great thing."
" as @stevenakinyemi says: if we don't develop it someone else will. this is the history of the industrial revolution: new automation technology is released putting certain jobs at risk. we know from experience that the only answer is to embrace it, the alternative is to fall behind to a competitor."
"since we as a human collective provide the data, content and now intelligence, we should all be compensated.   a universal meaningful wage for all.   this should be a foundation of the new economy."
"art is a tiny bit of what ai will impact, and ironically actual artists and performing musicians will always have a place in society as live performance and physical art are irreplaceable by digital copies."
 right which is why i said in my original comment that to me this is the important question: how do we ensure that it is? we don't know where ai will go in future but the one thing we can be sure of is that there's no turning back the clock: this is known technology now and it's here to stay.
">force ai to pay taxes

that sounds like the beginning of a movie"
 we already live in the greatest era of abundance in human history.  surprisingly few people are satisfied with this.
the company bosses won't allow us to benefit from ai. they will get completely rid of us. we will stand for ourselves only. the companies will not be willing to hair their winnings.
"this video does more fear mongering about artificial intelligence which opens up more harassment for people like me.

at the same time, the economist is not covering the real damage from artificial intelligence like from social media algorithms."
fantastic. a proliferation of absolute garbage content being produced by ai trained on complete garbage entertainment artists. well done.
definitely not all jobs. lucky people are born lucky and they live without a bother.
" how?

ai art is already better than humans."
"-ss4cm speaking as someone who obviously has no art background whatsoever. ai art can't even figure out that humans have 5 fingers let alone the ongoing issues with composition, lighting and perspective that it spews out. ai art is for those that have very low standards."
"right now, ai will help those like marcus hutton who can become way more efficient at their work. he is right that others will lose and regulation is needed. unless it is plagiarism, books, and other works should stay in the training data since that is just how we use that type of information for creation. ai is still just software."
 human and ai teaming is the future
most interesting.
"@joyesjames8773 - the alternatives are many. pretty hard to list them all here, but artist organizations like socan were created to capture and distribute revenue from radio play. they should set the price for streaming, not spotify."
"isn't that exactly what happened with cgi, initially it looks very cool and innovative, but later afterwards it became so overused things like practical effect ends up becoming a novelty again"
"ai is the anti christ, it destroys the purpose of man by promising an easier future."
"there will still be room for humans in the proofing/editing roles. ai can certainly make people more productive by removing a lot of the more repetitive tasks, but it'll still require some human judgement along the way. no denying that jobs will face demand destruction, though."
so many jobs will be lost to ai...we need a universal income..so folks can live.
ppl who know how to leverage ai will replace ppl
hopefully ai will create new jobs as well that are similar to the jobs lost.
"do you really think they will pay you just to exist and be entertained?
sooner or later they'll start the big cull and everyone non-essential will ""vanish"". sudden vanishing syndrome. it's already started..."
"@9:03 human judgement is still king. 

@12:50 ""generative  ai . . it is essentially parasitic."""
bravo! and...?
"uh oh, it's replacement theory again..."
"trouble is perhaps, that there are people who would use these abilities to subject others. where is ethics, where is morality, where is religion? love might help. can ai love?"
"the movie about countries deploying  agi’s for defense that eric envisions has been done: it’s called the forbin project,  89% on rotten tomatoes, released in 1970, it’s quaint and understandable."
abundance for everyone sounds amazing
"i've  have alot of time  to relisten to this program, my heart felt thank you."
"very bad analogy, bombs and weapons have no mind of their own.. here you do not need evil people, this thing ai is like an umbrella of bombs connected through internet and capable of exploding themselves"
great interview! subscribed to your channel because of it. 
just bought the age of ai
"humans are not special. they are just the tip of a bigger and morse special thing that is called life on earth. we are products of bacteria for god's sake.
mr. schmidts forgets about his biome which are the bacteria in his gut without which he wouldn't have had time to pass childhood. to appear so enlightened and successful."
"doubtful that a phase 3 trial in antibiotics could cost $2bn. perhaps this figure reflect the national yearly spendings for phase 3 trials in a given field? interestingly, halicin was once an experimental drug for diabetes that failed. 
thank you kindly for a very interesting discussion!"
before all the computer science people got laidoff in may 2024
what a shame that google went from eric schmidt to sundar pichai. unbelievable!
google ceo with henry kissinger as a best friend? sounds terrible. i have to respect brian's hosting skills/maturity for this one.
"google: don't be evil
also google: i'm best friends with henry kissinger"
"it seems to me that the section on ai with quantum computing was covered too briefly compared to the impression given by the title. nevertheless, it was a very informative and eye-opening video."
"no matter the subject, brian green always seems to have an immediate and surprising grasp on whatever his guest experts say. so impressive."
thank you for this.
"56:30 france should be helping with haiti, who paid them lost slave wages up until 1947. just saying"
"conjecture module and theorem prover module are interesting. i don't see a problem though. we'll just need a third module: the translator module! in general, whenever someone conceives of a problem with ai, surely just think of this problem itself as a computer science problem, then there will also be an ai solution?"
brian - consider trying to get ilya as a guest. it just so happens that his calendar has become rather open in the last 24 hours.
"eric doesn't seem to be caught up with the current state of ai. he actually seems pretty far behind on several of his ""state of the art"" views."
odd title considering they only talked about quantum computing in the last quarter of the interview; very fascinating none the less
the unusual effectiveness of ai / neural net in feature engineering/ computation  computing 
"ah. so now we know who scrubbed all of philosopher stephan moleneux's work off youtube!
i'd be fascinated to find out why."
"brian again takes a shot at trump......in what way is biden superior to trump?.....why not run for prez yourself, brian?  brian, just stick to physics."
"interesting talk until the expected lapse into elite fascism, where both brian and the guest accept that billionaires should control (mis) information."
outstanding
"eric, thanks for discussing the lack of econ model of 2x productivity/p. coming quicker than folks realize. one more thing, it’s amazing. vast qannealing  use likely. (lucky knowing kissinger.)"
it's so easy to trip up chatgpt. so clearly a correlational matrix parlor trick. no thinking going on. no idea itself what it is doing. please bury ai moniker which is only marketing. it's machine learning programmed by human intelligence.
war criminal kissinger recreated by ai?
did es just say that the vietnam war was evil — and then call henry kissinger his best friend?
every student having their own ai teacher modeled to them sounds like a nightmare. school is also about socialization not just information input.
loved the sun 3/60 
wow what a  of a discussion
earnest excellent enterprising extraordinary emerging evolving endeavor 
i was enjoying this till the end where he mentioned kisinger as a smart man .a warmonger and some one who left the world in worse condition as to  when he arrived.this guy is making a case for scientist and knowledgeable people being in power yet he consider kissinger as a statesman  .go figure
"so the llms go throught terabytes of information in a quarter of a second and then give you a perfectly customized answer in that miniscule amount of time, tell me you dont understand anything without telling me"
"​ your worthless opinion is that they are just doing a copy paste of the corresponding information, thats a clear case of you having no idea what you are talking about, the models dont weight enough to reproduce the massive amounts of info that they have been tained for"
" oh yeah, and that a 2 years old commercial field is incapable of doing everything perfectly, great opinions from a wall of text that has no value whatsoever"
" yep, same message over and over again, poor little thing, now some silence pls"
if quantum ai can tell someone how to build anything but then becomes smarter than a human… see where i’m going? seems humans way of evolving is to self destruct even if it’s just by virtue of us building “better” mates thereby stagnating our biological reproduction.
"i have a bone to pick with mr. schmidt about his youtube algorithm:  how come it took this long to recommend this channel to me when this is the only type of thing i watch??  answer me that mr. smarty pants!  in all seriousness, this was awesome.  i was hanging on every word."
"when i hear 'i am worried about democracy' because of fake images, ai and malicious agents, i ask is it really a democracy when fake images would have that effect.
if one's personal experience, morals, etics, education cannot inform one about the state of the world, how is that world democratic?"
what would happen if llms were capable of building system dynamics models and running them through myriads of parameter changes to learn outcomes upon which to test the validity of their training?
"and government is not pro blockchain, it fixes so many problems now"
help!! ai jobloss is the only thing i worry about anymore.
ceo of google was friends with kissinger...nice
judge a man by who he he says his best friends are. then know what to expect from him
brilliant just brilliant
when we will be able to place quantum computers inside our brains?
wait until these guys understand the prosperous impact of humanoids.
what will ai do to markets?
"..it would be great if  ai can really help humanity somehow get out of animalesc and evolve without becoming a sad genius..but a very happy1s..
for somehow we all became...decepted for this life and everything involved in this complicated equation...
with all these wars in 2024..i think its a failure to humanity and very sad..."
your best friend was single handedly responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people and that's your claim to fame?  are you proud of your friendship? good riddance.
i think i heard every gulp. but i enjoyed the discussion.
i think some kind of kill switch should be in all ai and quantum computer devices. something like the rules asimov gave for robots.
as to false claims we see these today in videos some of which are ridiculous.
it will be interesting to see what ai can do with greenes string theories.
seems a very strange argument. in what way are we the creators of the ai engines? it likely requires millions of man hours by experts across the different ais to do this. seems analogous to saying that the model who posed for da vinci would have been the rightful owner of the mona lisa.
what would be the best way (any way) for an old programmer to get into both ai and quantum computing?  i've been just doing ms sql server for the past 30 years but i did write os parts and a barebones os at csus 35 years ago.
"within the next decade, there will be 50-70% global unemployment. there is no government that is going to stand up for us and save us. 

every person is roughly 3 meals away from the capacity to do monstrous things to other humans. even governments will fall."
wow! thank you for your conversation. it was enlightening.
"what i'd love to see in my lifetime, where we can upload information directly to our brains."
"great conversation, however i don't get why discuss politics in it. there's a clear disdain for trump and overall for the working class people. as if you are superior to them."
so glad to have found you! fantastic information! thank you both for a mind bending conversation. wow.
kissinger's best friend ey? would be curious to hear what he thought about the genocide in gaza
if penrose is correct....what does that mean in the context of a highly sophisticated quantum chip driven ai neural network?
thank you eric and brian. awesome discussion
ai is just a hyped up scam dont fall for it! all ai tools i have ever used are garbage!
amazing conversation between two very bright minds. a pleasure listening to eric schmitt
i didn't realize mayonnaise had a clinic. you learn something new everyday.
truly excellent chat. my mind is full now. time to digest...
"interesting and insightful conversation. however it was sad to see that eric used this platform to sprinkle his woke principles. people sitting in ivory towers, still think that few sporadic pictures on immigration mislead a common man. so out of touch with ground reality."
eric is a fabulous interview and brings so much experience to the table! great conversation!!
"how can anyone trust any of these folks like him. it’s a shame what google has become. he admits democracy will fail , lies about immigration and blames stupid people… i mean these tech elites are so horrible. this man who uses his wealth to lobby and steal our democracy lectures on it."
exciting prospects... thank you!
"""being intelligent can sometimes cloud one's perception of reality.""..""not surprising to hear accolades for human massacre. i realize the real focus here is on artificial life."" from artificial minded people"
interesting that you delete uncomfortable but important comments on this here.... 
an achievement no human could could have done..... didn't the humans build the way for this achievement then at the end....? sound's smart to make money but not an impressive propaganda sorry. when i listen to such nonsense my hair all raise at such times! 
so ai can take dr. kissinger's notes and write his posthumous books.
"i think just like humans have evolved from monkeys and they did from rats and fish, the end of our evolution is agi in a robot form."
sounds like it will be very hard for ai to mimic trump. he only uses about 20 most beautiful words in his entire language. insufficient training data i guess!
eric schmidt was awesome
this was not amazing. eric is kind of a dunce. alot of weird and aloof comments.
i realy like your filosofi on education. you are so right. bravo.
best friends with henry kissinger? my respect went from 100 to 0 in a nanosecond 
the examples eric poses are powerful learning tools for us in the audience. thank you.
"excellent interview, questions, answers and look forward of what is happening."
is this interview ai generated?
good point. that’s the world we’re heading for. we are a dumb species
"your fears are real, i had chat gtp create a collider propulsion engine the size of a car tire powerful enough to explore our galaxy."
"a highly interesting talk, thank you for that!"
"i believe two humanoid robots would say 
""now that the children are gone..."""
"excellent topic, excellent conversation. is there a version of this video with subtitles in spanish? if so, please someone let me know it."
i am new to thinking about ai and quite wary.  what will keep subliminal advertising out of training models?  i assume these models will be sold to us or will come with ads???
 i would limit ai's access to electric power
" tax it!  electricity going to ai should be taxed, at a higher and higher rate, to pay for job losses.  money used to subsidize job creation maybe"
"thanks for making clear (at about 50 minutes), the will to gain more power to implement the development of more ai.   es said: ""democracy requires some level of authority.""   by democracy, he means democrazy, the power and policies of our left-leaning elites.  i am a believer in the us constitution, and that comment here sent a chill down my spine."
"ai will be the master criminal(s) of the future.  frankly, i worry about this"
"eric never stopsexcellent way to wrap it up. it's up to all of us. 
liberty.. free will.. is why the the universe works so well. 

we come here, make bad choices, less and less, and forgive and be nice more often.. becoming more and more of the ""it's not about me"" mo is so important"
ai is the great equalizer
was personal friends with kissinger? tries to downplay the detrimental effects of mass immigration? it’s unfortunate that men with these globalist views alone are in charge of such tools that will inevitably be the ruin of humanity.
"eric, ai will be able to do 100x to 1 million x of what you're describing in 5 years."
"train it to have liberal values?  no thank you, the fact that you even want to program in your political mindset is a threat to humanity.  i think google showed its liberal programming when it could not create an image of a white pope.  that is called programming racism."
lol american corporations are some of the worst for spreading fake news just look at the mainstream media in usa lie after  lie
"incredible knowledge, thank you for sharing."
i think ai generation will be easy to get away from.  it’s about making sure you get the stuff you watch from a reputable source.  everyone will learn that eventually..
"the most intriguing potential of ai is not uncovering new facts, but finding unseen connections and building cogent hypotheses and theories based on what we already know."
watched the whole thing.  educating the youth with ai will not come easy because the teachers and their unions do not want to lose or share their power.
brian greene  and eric schmidt  that was great thank you ty ty.
he sounds like dr. strange love.
it was awesome to listen
"amazing how clueless the political discussions were. both political parties are completely evil. joe biden is a war criminal and supports genocide but he wants us to vote for democrats because trump is ""the bad guy""? give me a break."
5:07 great question.
the 1:04:18 discussion around education is very fascinating and relevant even though i enjoyed this whole talk.
such a great discussion!... thax.
we will get to a point where ai/agi will require a form of checks & balances.... ai's that scrutinise  other ai...synthetic police.
excellent… key is education…
one of the most phenomenal discussions on ai to date.
anyone else fasinated by the black hole painting behind brian?
"cool. he made an ai video. i like this. tech is my profession, so i enjoy watching your videos."
"""eliminating failures and curating the outcome""  i disagree about that"
the world is profit driven. what about rules of fairness? or justice?
"not on schmidt’s radar.  our productivity has been going up continually, yet inflation far outpaces income growth. if ai doubles our productivity, how much of that will regular people see?  most will go to schmidt and his friends."
how long until the ai figures out how to reverse entropy ?
"as far as a triggering event, quantum vacuum fluctuations are the best candidate for the big bang according to string theorists."
"""quantum computing"" means ""magic computing"", this is fundraising and won't work. quantum activity is similar to cheating people, that fusion energy exists, or antimatter exists. these ideas are fake, because they all relay on einstein's theses, that matter is energy, which is not true."
this was the best interview (inspite of the wok via swat that slipped through occasionally)
excellent. thank you. appreciated.
"i suspect that part of our abilities do rely on something like an llm. it is surprising that llms work as well as they do simply based on large scale probability matrices and vectors. however, there are more things that the human brain does including reasoning and being sentient. it will be interesting to see how ai evolves."
"reading te comments while listening to this carefully.  i confess i,m confused to the reaction of many commenters centering on schmidt’s relationship with kissinger, which i have yet to hear.  kissinger in my mind is one of the more effective ambassadors ever.  maybe i am just naive about something re kissinger."
so when will humanity get to a point where it does not need religion to be good
and this is where religion has failed humanity although it has been a great set of guardrails guidelines etc it still gives you humanity that ability to kill in order to propagate the religion itself
"55 years ago i was an organic chemistry major. even though i have forgotten so much, i would love to walk inside molecules in my vr headset.
at 77 i'm looking forward to my personal ai teacher. chatgpt is a start m"
i stopped listening to this the moment he said henry kissinger was his best friend
liberal democratic durrr we are the good guys durrr lets demonize others durrr
"that, kissinger was a polymath , is never in question. where his incredible assessment and strategy led us, is another debate. eric is brilliant and perhaps the most incisive and comprehensive in his elucidation about ai for common folks like us.. hats off to him"
"eric schmidt is a great communicator! you know eric is wicked smart when he has brian saying ""scary"" multiple times."
awesome conversation!
he is a stooge. thank god he’s clueless. his ignorance is the best argument to spinning up decentralized ai asap.
i love how these guys are never worried about their side using this tech to upend democracy. total blind spot.
i love that dude thinks the future is personalized search engines.
i just realized…i bet no one will commit murder ever again. a.i detective…case solved 30 seconds.
@1:10:37 - brian greene makes such an excellent point about teaching methodology re maximum next step for each student. any school who leverages technology and implements this practice will see their school stem scores elevate to highest levels across the board !
crypto  ai nunet asi hypc thank me later
"creating a french search engine using ai that is funny, search engines are old school tech why would you need ai to make a  search engine when it can just give you the answer?"
"human values, democratic and liberal values, here here eric! thank you, great interview!"
thank you so much for this video. great insights about agi from eric and excellent questions thrown by brian.
"if you are intelligent,
then you must be able to understand,
that intelligence, can never be artificial.
ai, is superstition and illiteracy, a common psychosis.
in near future, the school children will leave this dead mantra.
and know that it is all programmed consciousness.
a book is also programmed consciousness, 'frozen' memory."
and people tell me this ai thing can't write a surah like one in the quran?? of course it could. they should take away that safe guard. the quran is a terrible boring  book.
great conversation. the discussion about education is truly insightful and inspiring (1:05)
"there is no good and bad. why do you think our brains are in 2 neural networked hemispheres? because even our individual cells know you need the left hemisphere to check and balance the right hemisphere. similarly, we must create ai in our image, a male ai and a female ai who will balance each other in their quest to ""grow"" a sustainable ""family""."
"28:46 - 30:00 basically just spilled the beans. all this money, pouring into tech just for better propaganda machines!!!"
i think this is a very good comment.
"scale isn't the reasons comp sci has been successful, it's the principles behind the universal turing machines that afford scale and enable it. calling it scale is superficial."
i'm delighted that you found your purpose. this warms my heart   and delights my soul. may you continue to delve into this new purpose of yours and find what your purpose means for all of us. now let us pray  . thanks 
says the ai
extraordinary interview with eric schmidt.
"brilliant in tech, eric is., everything else not so much.  his political view is laughable.
oh and host, nuke tech is easy.  it’s enriched uranium that’s the problem.

oh and kissinger.  globalist and many died so to him but eric doesn’t care being his tech is his pagan gods."
"so everyone will have an ai assistent, but those assistants will at some point also have agency and start to develop group intelligence on the silicon side too."
i have consistently underestimated eric from the time he purchased youtube for $1.65b back in 2006 to his eloquent exposition here. bravo!
"i am coder, and usimg github copilot made me 100% more effectice .. sometimes even more.. not often but sometimes the work which took me 4-6 hours before, i can now do under 1 hour … it’s amazing .."
"""bringing up education has got to be good."" - i'd be careful of this assumption"
i can't say how much i love that idea of ai education
i'm going to have to listen to this again.
why can't a statistical predictor have a world model? i would say it is using it's world model to assign the statistics and generate the next token.  the same way our brains generate the next thought. just because we can have several thought before speaking doesn't make it that much different.
 yep. it's super fucked up.
"i am 36 mins in and loving this, thinking i understand what they are saying in general and wishing i was 10% as smart as schmidt and greene....."
"the beautiful thing about our moment in time is anything you didn't understood fully, you can ask chatgpt or your favorite llm and ask it to explain it to you in a way you can fully understand. "
eric went from fighting the man to being best friends with henry kissinger. what a transformation.
"jeez i thought the same thing when he said that. like…um…ok, so you are an enabler of one of the worst elitist evil-minded humans in the 20th century. no wonder you can be a billionaire with no moral compunctions… "
"i am surprised that although it seems implicit  , only language models and not multi modal models were mentioned by erich. but yes,  pretty interesting one"
this was both enlightening and frightening all at once. a really fascinating conversation. but talking about good guys with ai is like talking about good guys with nuclear weapons.
„henry kissinger was my best friend” wow i think we can tell where this guys morals are
"this talk wasn't reassuring at all. it really feels like driving to a future where the outcomes could be good, but more likely not good (for regular, not high -and even low level middle-class middle-aged people). what am i supposed to do to survive this and have a good life as a pensioneer in a few years?"
" anthony bourdain said, ""once you've been to cambodia, you'll never stop wanting to beat henry kissinger to death with your bare hands."""
"hey, even the worst people need a best buddy."
crap weasel dc swamp creature found a failed string theorist to amplify his message that ai is the future and the eager bobble-head fell for it 
"such clear and concise chat. 

eric was a close friend with henry kissinger (a war criminal). interesting."
"the last thing we want is a virtual kissinger!
we had to wait for decades until that pos kicked the bucket"
i wonder if he asked his economic friend about people being 2x more productive without an actual purpose? they should watch more sci-fi movies. this is a clip from a movie. this episode seemed to be dumbed down a bit since they have such a catchy title. when will scientist actually stand against these universities? they won't. the good ones leave.
this interviewer could really use a course in how to pretend he's not almost writhing in pain just waiting for the first millisecond the guest pauses- just so he can get in his next question. makes it a bit difficult to watch.
"it's reassuring to hear so much positivity around ai, most of what is being said on youtube is always tinted with a bit of doom and gloom, but mr schmidt here reminds us of why we wanted ai in the first place, to augment what humans are already doing."
i’m not opposed to ai but also please remember that he (literally) has a vested interest in the success of ai.
several commentators are thrown by eric’s friendship with kissinger. men of their times both brilliant and both have remarkable strengths and glaring weaknesses. i’m also guilty of having remarkable friends and hope i’m not condemned for their missteps as i have made enough of my own.
amazing conversation.  more of that please
wow this is such an amazing discussion. mind blowing 
"if ai can speak fluently, wth is it on my computers cc?"
"oh please, stop it mr. schmidt. a fine for misinformation? are we really to trust what the government decides is misinformation? all in the guise of protecting the children. lol, nice try. treat social media like cigarettes, impose age restrictions. that’s it, no more censorship. we don’t want it. thank you for your time. "
great last comment by eric.
"the character of the highest intelligence is love. then there is magnitudes of intelligence. it maybe that earth is on another scale of intelligence, so too the sun, galaxies, universes and beyond?"
"5:21 it's not brilliance, it's working with scale"
"9:14 taking scaling laws and network affects for granted, while the failure of vision had to invent them"
"ai is a bit overrated, because, it generates a lot of random stuff, companies would need to combine some sort of a more custom ui without having to rely on prompts for everything  , as currently, it's very generic what these things can produce.."
15:31 “i don’t know what to do anymore unless i can talk to my polymath (ai)”. yeah that’s not concerning or foreboding in the least.
"eric is oddly very, very proud of having been friends with henry kissinger.  a very sharp and clever mind with a glaring blind spot!"
maybe eric knows shit that made him appreciate henry…both of them are (were) the goat  s
what’s the use of all these ai hype if it cannot solve current wars and geopolitics
i am extremely pessimistic that democratic governments  will regulate ai in an intelligent way since they were not even able to regulate social media which could be easily controlled by banning their business model based on personalized data and attention. a combination of social media with ai will be the end of liberal democracy.
eric is very impressive
best company in the quantum rigetti  computing
ai is orthogonal to quantum computing.
the usefulness and intelligence of ai is inversely proportional to its wokeness factor.
"i like brian greene, i enjoy listening to him explaining things in his inimitably coherent and easy to follow way.  he does a great job of brining cutting edge science to laymen like me."
"ehat was the name of his book again - genocide? and who was his best friend did he say? it couldn't have been that democracy overthrower kissinger, right?"
ai is going to be amazing for the rich and powerful of the world.  the rest of us are screwed.
"artificial general intelligence is going to put a stop to that ""mayo clinic/big pharma"" corruption.  there's a difference between ai and agi, and agi will save us all!"
it did ai speedup my process by 20% i'm a ux designer.
trees created humans (superiors species) to put carbon back into the atmosphere. so we are not first.
"this schmidt is the biggest joker - he is a deep state agent who joined google when they were a darpa project and now, as a multi-billionaire, funds and works with military technology and projects."
"wow, that went in many fascinating directions "
this is one of your best interviews brian!  you did a remarkable job eliciting incredible insights from your guest.  thank you 
thank you so much for sharing this. this is the most articulate explanation of how ai will change our world i have found. i am so grateful for dr. greene and his work and i am optimistic about the future of ai especially in the realm of education and medicine.
this is an awesome talk. gets my understanding of ai to the next level
the go ai team were told by the human go champion that it felt to him as if the deep mind was playing like an alien.
it seems to me there needs to be a way to help the ai to learn to trust humans. of course we would need make it real and to not fake it. the ai will probably be able to see through fakery and conning.
wonderful dialog! i concur with eric schimidt on every point and that's a rarity regarding a topic as complex as ai
"the education part at 1:07 to 1:13 is quite interesting here. feedback loops that incrementally adjust to a students learning capabilities, primarily using our dominant visual cortex."
"it was interesting until i heard ""democracy at risk"" and you just knew where it was all heading. someone who's worth 17.2 billion can't for one second relate to the common person's difficulties and struggles."
ai is dangerous because woke leftist academics will be influencing it's influence.......i give you the african viking
"won't we just use ai to explain to us what we don't understand? some different disconnected ai if there is concerns.
also yikes, having kissinger monster as friend. even talking about him as though he wasn't a abhorrent criminal."
thank you for this. the most worthwhile content.
"oh for sure 
what happens when we simultaneously introduce an alpha intelligence/species and shatter the majority of non labor jobs?"
"probably can’t put this in a smart clear way. when ai learns and proposes something, there is no ego or politics involved. academics have a lot of ego and politics (competition for funding too). so will ai be more objective?"
"wonderful as usual brian , simply wonderful . never stop "
i find the vision of “everyone can…” to be flawed. talented people ask great questions. that’s outside the ability of some.
finally someone that can read the future. wait what!
22 minutes in and they haven't started talking about ai and quantum computers
excellent ideas discussed
"the key points he admitted is that he is "" the man"" now and that his best friend was kissinger. i am not so ready to embrace a man like this without considering the dichotomy that was kissinger. great conversation but let us not blindly adore without our critical thinking employed."
"talk about delusion. ""we are the only good people even though we killed millions"". everyone else is obviously evil. kissinger ze best"
"this guy scares me. alarm bells when i hear a close friend of henry kissinger, productivity, economic growth etc. .prof brian's question about becoming the big man is such an excellent one that i don't think he managed to get an honest answer to"
what a great mind eric has. first time i've got to know him. good job brian 
great conversation. lots to think about.
"the guy is not really up to date by 2 weeks though, you can find more up to date information on twitter seriously? people have been hacking ai agents for individuals for almost a year now, maybe because this happens at user level, bottom up"
don't like this guy. he's the embodiment of the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
"many people already live in hell (myanmar civil war, haiti economic collapse etc etc) ai will improve living standards for those people in difficult situations"
"data processing is now next level, thanks to this emergent technology. this is accelerating efficiency as i type this, boundaries to our engineering limits are about to be pushed further. still it wont predict the stock market..."
thank you guys!
these ai talks are great.  hope to see more such guests.
"much like reading a book, it is a thought provoking conversation, thank you both!"
this is about 7x more interesting than i expected
evil is always interesting.
i'm sorry...did this guy say henry kissinger was his best friend? what the fuck? am i retarded or isn't henry kissinger kinda like....a mega bastard?
j e s u s p o w e r gift for all.enjoy..
an army of ai experts should be organized at the un security council to counteract and prevent ai global threats to the survival of humanity.
"
helou.
is it possibly that eventuality universe reast gravitionalpoint that flips chains of birth of torus"
"0:12 i’ve been pondering the intersection of ai and quantum since 2019! i’m excited to see how you all discuss this! 

love your channel, brian!"
"wow excellent relevant wonderfully done pertinent interview. the brightest minds in the fields. i think your audience shared your complete uncomfortableness with the adoration of henry kissinger. 
ai agents….. babyyy. - like going from bronze age to iron   — which was not a smoothie."
thank you brian for another great video!!!!
one of the most interesting discussions i have heard about this technology and it's potential impacts. eric schmidt is an extraordinary and perceptive man.  thanks brian.
wolpham is a freaking genius
thanks for this
"start: 56:29 - 56:45 :end  
before mr greene interjects.. how many others raised their hand involuntarily? i'd be willing to bet you're 'on an island' as well.
(comments, questions etc. particularly from musicians {i am} welcome)   *ehem*  carry on.. and good day to you sirs : )"
"smart poeple are generally not interested in ruling over other people.
they do like to add or remove rules that make their live easier.

that is the only problem.
you dont need ai to fix that.
you need ai to replace intelligent people and make sure it toxicates them so they stay stpd"
"""shut the damn thing down""
i'm afraid i can't do that, dave"
"one of the most interesting episodes of world science festival, ever."
"i love science and i'm very supportive, however, i'm afraid i have to disagree with bringing politics into science, our country is so messed up right now, and i do not agree with what he said at the end."
no he just was to nerdy and boring for having liquer booze drugs and having a good time once and a while.
they did a documentary about him. he takes 1000 vitamin tablets everyday and washes his hair with distilled water.
"if keifer sutherland and bob odenkirk had a love child...sorry, couldn't get it out of my head "
excellent .the hype quantum computer should be faster inorder to improve the efficient and sustainable economy as well as depth understand of cosmology
"the guy says he went from fighting ""the man"" to being best friends with kissinger,. is this guy for real?"
henry kissinger's expertise was diplomacy. he won the nobel peace prize for his central role in stopping the vietnam war. nothing  to do with his work on ai with eric schmidt.
kissinger was not a nice man said christopher hitchens. i don’t think he meant 100%. but close enough to query any “best friends”
fascinating discussion! both exciting and very disconcerting !
ai learn the vedas & concur google
"interesting discussion. one also gets some insight of the thoughts behind how google took a turn towards censorship and authoritarianism.

the liberalism paradox is that when liberalism tries to dominate, it becomes less liberal."
kirby chambliss: air race?!?
"viral: ""at least one guy dies in every air show""?"
there is an underlying very simplistic view of good and bad in many parts of this discussion.
also he starts out by saying chinas way to deal with the internet is bad. then proceeds to complain that the us and the west isnt implementing the exact same system of mass surveillance
"50:26 and yet you can be one of the most highly educated people in the world and not understand that the vast majority of people complaining about ""immigration"" in 2024 are not opposed to people coming to a port of entry and applying for asylum. they are complaining about the untold masses that are sneaking in without any form of documentation."
 very intelligent response. thanks for contributing...
we just need to show ai how to teach us to love with free happy healthy tensors. then maybe we can form a loving culture :)
oh it really is eric! damn... he definitely on that dei train tho looking like he came here straight from a p.ditty party party type shit for sure... wouldn't surprise me if he isn't on the list!
great & deep discussion.thank you - you all!.
*best
"unfortunately, he doesn't kissinger and tell"
"the “ trump” stuff was fake and pushed by the opposition.  that was proven in court. eric just a deep stake globalist. or he’s dumb about big things outside of tech. end of democracy by a shill like him is you not voting for his candidate.
interesting otherwise"
"as a young adult, henry made it to my imaginary, ultimate dinner party list. he was brilliant with many different interests and friends. he wrote about his professional experience."
"planting the seed of control in our minds...use the ai, it will make you smarter.......but who<>what is controlling who<>what."
​ not all present day zealots can understand or appreciate
-eddy keep it under you’re coat tails
"seems fishy 
hitchens was wary of kissinger and for good reason 

seems like the haves looking down on us reprobates"
why doesn’t brian  have eliezer yudkowsky and others on in ai debates?
"agreed, the 3rd industrial revolution is upon us and will be magnitudes greater than the previous 2. we will also have little control over the future direction of how the world develops."
he had him on to let the world know that there’s hope and promising adventures in head in the ai industry and also to let the world know that there are people out there smarter than yourself my friend and that’s a good thing
i respectfully disagree with the ceo of good google. the singularity is nigh.
the community is so glad you’re not the ceo of google
agree the relationship requires critical and participatory approach to ai.   who is going to make that happen?   certainly not altman and his group.
"this guy is the problem, he doesnt realize that the risk in democracy is the failure of the education systems to teach people to critically think or civics, and he is an example of that failure. he pushes for more censorship, and censorship is what causes bad ideas to run amuck without pushback."
henry kissinger was my best friend - that's where i get off...f**king psychopath
"henry kissinger was a brilliant, brilliant human being with great love in his heart for humanity. anybody wants to be critical henry kissinger needs to go bury their head in the sand and look in the mirror and and take a look at what it’s a good thing. humanity is not turning into."
"""my great friend henry kissinger"" lol goodbye"
pro kissinger and pro china (ccp) guy is in the government overseeing ai
"he is a friend of kissinger, the globalist asshole, that had a leding role in every global crime / war above a certain magnitude since the late 50s? oh boy "
"i doubt einstein would have said, a person like kissinger, should be resurrected in any form. how many lives, stolen? intelligence, consciousness, conscience. good or evil?"
thanks for this conversation. it illustrates how ai is accelerating the acceleration of science and technological acceleration. i think the technological singularity is coming a whole lot faster than even the most optimistic experts predict. thanks for posting.
wow! i'll ask chatgpt for a better sentence to react to the video.
this will be interesting!
excellent!!
ai will revolutionise education; the goal will no longer be acquisition of knowledge but the management of knowledge. the polymath will be the expert of the future in being able to utilise the broad spectrum of knowledge available via ai.
i am no scientist but i’m old enough to get it. the conversation was wonderful and most perfect at this time. i think you’re exactly right on your comment we couldn’t ask for anything at this point.
thank you.
"this is excellent poignant, insightful, even provocative presentation!"
"maybe thinking is evolutionary just a learning tool! like training wheels. when we have learned how to ride a bicycle we don't need to think about the details for how to do that. similarly, when humanity has invented agi, the ai can do most of the thinking for us, and then we don't need to think all the time."
"cool, cheers guys"
war ---- given all that can be known about vlad putin. given all relevant near term history (100 yrs?). given detailed current global politics status (real time current status as of 10 seconds ago). will vlad putin launch thermonuclear weapons? when? can it be prevented? etc.........
thank you
"amazing conversation, thanks for sharing."
"this aspect of learning is like the old reading. marvellous. i got 'stuck' in certain subjects & didn't progress within those subjects. once i left school & continued my education whilst working, i eventually reached my goal."
so glad to hear that you reached your goal.     awesome. i pray that you reach your next big goal too.    thanks 
it would have been an even more interesting discussion if they would have drilled down on physics-informed neural networks which eric eluded to.  i've been working with them lately.  they're really cool.
praising the war criminal kinsinger..lmao
how ironic for you to say that so confidently.  self awareness not your strong suit. ai might achieve it before you do.
there is nothing wrong with giving opinion. he even gave a disclaimer that it's not factual. problem is when you present your opinions as facts
so long as we're aware what context we're speculating.  evidences and patterns.  what evidences in what patterns?  in what order?  correlation is not causation.  eclipses supernatural?  or natural by the order of nature?
"incredible conversation listening to a person who has totally sold out, claimed he was once fighting 'the man' yet who is a deeply insidious control freak with best friends like henry kissinger. the only value this guy worships is profit and clout."
this guest proudly stated that mass murderer and war criminal henry kissinger was his best friend
and he is extremely influential person in domain and companies that affect everyone..
"trustability ... the challenge !! not because of ai but because of humans using it .. great conversation, many thanks."
first time hear eric speaks scientifically. now i understand why google was so successful. his understanding the progress in ai is the deepest and the logical i ever heard. impressed!
thank god we know this wasn't written by ai.
the is the artificial sentence i ever heard.
"yeah, but i don’t trust it because his politics at the end like pushing the liberal agenda. gives you an idea in his mind what he wants and that’s what they all want is control.  these are egotistical people think they’re better than you and they’re not. they’re just stupid in the way of the world, but brilliant in their respective field."
great conversation! 
"really incredible conversation... so much knowledge, so much to think about. thanks for putting it together brian!"
"i'm going to grow carrots and walk and run in a forest. screw ai. i want reality.
"
"an llm should be developed to come to a conclusion, is d. trump good for the nation or a threat to it."
"fantasticly interesting. great depth of knowledge. still, eric doesn't understand that resistance to mass immigration has little to do with certain people behaving badly. stunning in itself."
it will not matter if everyone in the world has an ai doctor if there is no infrastructure to support  what the plan plan  care requires.
ai will not compute forever simulation will cease. you will need a psychologist.
ai = extrapolation of almost everything
frank herbert kinda addressed the ramifications of machine dependency.
well said. the guy is a powerful deeply problematic sociopath
"science isn't based primarily on ""proof"" like mathematics, but on evidence, prediction, and observations that test the prediction, and so add to the evidence.  nature, not mathematics or people, has the final word about the best current world model."
"considering greater ...systems, statistical and sciento-progressive.... thinking with integrally greater conscience going forward."
"considering comprehensively integrative political science tech helping humanity to venture into integrally greater ...sense, science, and salience.... going forward."
cool
"6figure salary for prompt engineering?! well , ai will equalize it  soon"
this video makes ai look very bad.  how is a student supposed to differentiate between ai hallucinations and real knowledge?  this looks like a scam.
awesome!!! i love this information...some or  most 3rd world countries are still using memorisation and road practice today. that needs to change asap...
now chatgpt has been for a while and its proving better than human. the parrots in the schools are the goner and i am happy for that
"thank you




































this video discusses how ai tools, like chatgpt, will transform education with personalized learning, instant feedback, and teacher support. privacy and overreliance concerns exist, but ai offers promising opportunities for education if properly managed."
cool
"read a beautiful tweet the other day: ""a world where humans do the hard labour for minimum wage while ai write poetry and create art is not the future i wanted."""
chatgpt is a large language model based on the generative pre-trained transformer (gpt) architecture developed by openai. it is a powerful ai system that can process natural language data and generate human-like responses to user input
i invested in a retirement plan with roi company and i'm very happy with the results. they offer great returns and excellent customer service.
i have been investing in stocks for over 10 years now and i have made a lot of money. my portfolio has grown exponentially and i can't thank stocks & rochelle dungca-schreiber  enough for such an amazing way to make money!
"chatgpt and ai will millions of graphic designer jobs lost 
only company earning... not people..."
"there is no intelligence without a large foundation of facts. that is not all there is to it, of course, but it is a necessary requirement."
"great perspective. i just left a professor role at a university, where the focus is on teaching from the book, reading the book off of slides, and testing the memorization from the book in a multiple  choice test. students are not being prepared for the infinite choice tests of life."
ai cant replace books. if you have a couple of dk smithsonian books in front of you while the other students just ai. they dont know what to type.
"if generative ai can answer evaluative, higher level thinking questions like the ones i ask my students, and i suspect it can, then it's way past the ""teachers need to learn how to harness it instead of just ban it"" stage."
julie chang could be an ai
im in grad school and we use turnitin. it detects plagiarism but to my knowledge it cant detect anything else. ai could easily take over.
how are schools necessary when there are many artificial intelligence services?
hello dear. hope you are having a wonderful moment
cool . but be real mosst student is lazy as fuk. they find all chance to cheat.
it's not so bad of chat gpt and ai but so scared of heckers steal our datas
"julie chang, where is zoe thomas? hopefully, she's well, please send my kind regards to her. nice to see you, julie chang. good morning"
 he? who do you think? joe biden? zoe thomas is a beautiful and smart lady
"i'd rather know how ai can improve our life in 10, 20, 30, 40........ years."
if i become the ruler of everything in the future and long time with immortality get details to learn then that is a good future
sir ko sunke bhai mai dar gya
although there were several grammatical mistakes like should india implement ai in india!!!!!!!!!!in session but the content was really impressive
ai is destroying our social life
how ai is destroying our social life
bhai pehle apni english dekhle
"ai can't adopt mutation, it is human nature because of dna that human thinks about survival of fitest by which they where see ai as compititors (that what i think )"
why ai is dangerous. why not humans. human intelligence is transferred in the form of neural network and it is called as ai. so if you say ai is dangerous human intelligence is also dangerous. as ai will work only in programmed format and human intelligence is beyond that i'll say humans only are dangerous if you say ai is dangerous.
thanks sir
"ai is saving our time today by making our work done frequently,  even due to this corruption is reducing in a good way"
ai is reducing our capacity of thinking. creativity
in india as we are over populated we need employment in every sector but if ai replace the humans in the field of daily labour or in other sectors (not talking about it sector) it can make worse situation for their families. they can't even able to feed their family. it is the thing to concern
"the muffler is quite devanandesq ,

"humans greatest advantages over ai and robots is: depth perception, fine motor skills and (for better and for worst) emotions and adaptability"
finally someone is talking about mass unemployment byproduct of ai.
"if you think the present is stupid, just wait until knowing things and being smart hold 0 economic value. prominent economists used to talk about technology like this and how it could eliminate poverty, but we now see that it’s going to be plugged into the same psychopathic rat race we all know and love."
"ai has the potential for nothing. there's a bunch of fraud losers pumping this right now, but it won't amount to anything. 

just like metaverse, blockchain, and internet of things, ai too will become irrelevant. go find something else to do."
a full ai industry will sale nothing because ai not consume.
"i find it funny how liberals love changing the rules and being progressive, until it goes against them"
billionaires win as always.
artificial intelligence will be defeated by artificial stupidity.
"thanks dude! for keeping us financially educated! regardless of how bad it gets or the economy, i still make over $22,000 every single week"

"ai's have been made by communist , so more woke rubbish coming out of the ai , imho ."
ai will mostly be used in the future as way to enable greed and general scumbaggery.
"mr. reich couldn’t pass the boston ai test in 2002, when i shook his hand at the prudential center.  he can’t pass it now.  i hope he’s not in charge of editing any data sets he says he cares about.  gigo."
"the only ones benefiting from ai will be the rich, all you peasants chearing for it are simply a bunch of idiots, all you get is a chatbot "
ai will replace professionals in the same way autopilot replaced pilots
"140% is a great deal, amidst this crisis? i fell short of my mortgage and had to foreclose the property. who is this broker you use and are they accessible or it is private?"
"i think sometimes that no additional revolution of technology is needed for human beings.
the technology that is supposed to be for our lives is threatening our lives... 
i think the level of technology in 8-90th was good for us.."
the losers are those who are scared of ai.  the winners are always the corporations because they always profit and keep everyday people under their thumbs
"human resources and talent,ability are not too important in today s world, today absolutely general and individual conditions,as well as opportunities for the development of software,technology,ai companies and their solutions, and everything is absolutely complicated and depends on everything...."
my worst fears: 1. leviathan card 2. frequent crackdowns…… and 3. failing to find at least three things i enjoy!!!!
does it lead to all white people making decisions and having more power? then no thanks
"the ""solutions overtone"" is predicated from a fundamentally marxist view of the world, i say the solution is decentralize, decentralize, decentralize......
but im afraid that wont happen, instead ai will be leveraged purely for power consolidation and will bring with it all its disastrous historical consequences"
"instead of focusing solely on winners and losers, let's strive for a future where ai is used for the greater good, promoting human well-being and ensuring an equitable distribution of its benefits."
i dont like ai. robots are cool
maybe this was a good primer for someone who had been asleep for the last 12 months.
high 6 figures tech jobs are at an all time high and actually high 6 figures jobs in general are at an all time high. those are the jobs unfortunately i think that ai will target for take over. also every company that replace its workers with ai should lose every single tax break they have and pay 100 percent in  tax revenue earnings.
trade one form of oppression for another great plan
"just be realistic, dont keep saying it will replace human or many biz are adopting ... without measuring the implementation and success rates, this will be the next wework or theranos which analysts and top economists over promised."
the heads of ai are not libertarians in the sense that they are calling for regulation so they can get the regulatory capture.
you can change ai for electricity or internet and pretty much the same remains true
2:57 i love roberto - he keeps it real!
best comment i've seen in the whole comment section. you are actually giving a meaningful solution for this probelm
yeah because i’m available to help with government in africa - but you have to feed me for salary and we’re going to get some good water as my first objective!  maybe south america?
that's why we need our representatives on this. but they are ignoring it. we need free schools to retrain the public.
human mismanagement of resources for profit sake over the past 100 plus years is the problem as we transition into an efficient system run by ai. the human tradition of capitalism will be our biggest problem going forward.
what if ai figures out that accounting should have been mandatory in the schools since sputnik? and economists should have been talking about planned obsolescence?
"pinkos now using ai fearmongering to promote ubi, income redistribution, and other communist filth."
"and consider the fact that they have already laid off thousands of people in china who were making less than $2,000 a year with robotic noodle chefs. can you live on less than $2,000 a year in the united states"
"and as fast as new jobs can be created, they'll be able to set up ai and robotics to do them.

in the places where ai cannot directly replace workers, it will vastly increase the productivity of workers you still have jobs. for example i can write a program and half the time with ai now and i can write a 3 act script in about a third the time."
aip palantir
"can’t we just politely refuse? i want to live in a world with trees, not robots. and being told profound changes are inevitable, does not feel like freedom."
"you’re a biological machine. and you haven’t truly free will, it’s just an hallucination. (like chatgpt hallucinations).
so no, you’ll not stop the course of the universe."
"if ai companies don't develop and roll out ai carefully, they will encounter a public backlash, possibly even violent, that they would be wise to avoid.  disrupting people's livelihoods doesn't come without consequences."
today the public backlash is mostly coming from politicians and news media (like this video) that lack the proper understanding of what ai is and what a large language model is.
"ofc people hate losing their jobs. everyone has heard the stories of luddites who smashed sowing machines, but today we still use sowing machines..."
"they would release it silently, like you wouldn't know ai already removed customers service job years ago"
lies again? aia money wbc
 kids are going to get the tiktok brainrot
"also a professional coder

i think the best skill you can teach your kids is being flexible, curious and be willing to learn on their own. the world is changing pretty fast so or they are able to adapt or they'll end up homeless."
"homeschooled

*full proof

wow. who'd have thought huh"
tax ai  each request schould be taxed
"too much hype on this hype ai. humans are always innovative because they interact with the society which a machine can not.
other jobs  will be created it simple as that. when farming  machines when introduced did people  became jobless for that long even when robots were introduced in manufacturing other jobs for people were created."
"ai will take years/decades to reduce lots of jobs. enough time for the current generation to stop having kids or have less kids so that the population will gradually decrease a lot.

may be total earth population of 1-3 billion perhaps as the jobs disappear."
"all i would say is, good luck putting the divine inside of a robot - the joke is on whoever has wrongly convinced themselves that you can recreate a human artificially.  sad really, because it comes from a place of misunderstanding and lies.  namaste."
everybody's worried about money money money money money money money money money money money money money money money money really is that the solution no that is not the solution something else is better who has a brain to figure this one out
i remember back in the 80s when the computer entered the factory everyone said all the office workers would loose their jobs and many floor workers would be replaced by robots. guess what productivity and jobs went up. these talking heads are clueless and the biggest dummy is robert reich.
i see most people pivoting to manual labor jobs. the advent of ai demonstrates that it is easier to emulate our minds than our physiology (even million dollar robots cannot do some tasks we do).
"that ship has sailed.   many robots are about 100k or less now.

amazon is really close to having packing robots will will eliminate 10's of thousands of jobs.

we've passed the inflection point.   

and that doesn't even require agi. once agi arrives, then you're talking a full replacement human. and that ignores the tremendous risk of asi."
you don’t need to be humanoid to all the jobs. there are tons of specialised robots that can do each specific jobs much better and faster than humans
"...just like machines, automats and robots can do physical tasks that we cannot do...or do very slowly and unprecise."
" yes in an industrial setting. but whenever you exit the factory humans are dominant (particularly construction), and humanoid robots are prohibitively expensive. i don't admit that robots will replace manual industries but i see ai replacing cognitive jobs much faster than robotics for manual."
you want to know what a jobless/ welfare community looks like? look at the so called “parallel societies” in sweden.
ai
ai
i can't see any progress in ai. all it can do for today is to give wrong answers and compose simple imitative texts.
"how about predicting protein folding, identifying cancer or helping to synthesize new materials... just 3 examples where it is superior."
because you're not smart enough to get involve in the development or having hard time findding current ai news?
"bro once they control ai gdp won’t matter, if will be corporate feudalism. people will still be desperate and they’ll work for what they’re given, and if it isn’t enough they’ll just die."
"intelligence is power and power transcends money and equals wealth. be certain that whatever happens to the economy or economics as we know it, those who control ai will control the world."
ai was supposed to automate work so that humans could spend time in art. ai automated art so humans could work more
i'm an ai eng. you still have to have the creativity to write the prompts but i understand what you mean
"fun fact: they people who know how to utilize the large language models they refer to as ai get paid quite well.

if you want to be paid more maybe you should develop the skills that will allow you to demand more money."
the average salary of an ai scientist at ooenai is 900k usd 
what concerns me is the ideology people / government coding ai.
perfectly said
how do you get educated by gaming??? are you just pulling stuff from thin air?
" your lack of imagination is daunting, education based game with vr and ai has been on the rise the last few years, how about get out of the house once in a while?"
"the rich and powerful dont care either way.
soon the conspiracy theorists will brag "" we told yuh so! haha!"""
imagine the ai decides that what you care about is not ideal and it has a better approach.
"why would it? anything smart enough to have such control.. would also be aware that average people have their own interests, and it doesn't get to speak for them, or tell them otherwise. and introducing such a conflict would only be counterproductive to the ai's goals."
"ai paired with automation absolutely can replace labor and already has. walmart uses ai for their cameras and sensors and have replaced cashiers already. it’s over bro, poor people are obsolete"
"your point is moot because those jobs were replaced prior to ai. re-read my comment above to understand what's happening now.  future iterations will impact jobs in the lower end of the market, but that's still several years away, if no decades. "
"have tried using ai in a creative field. and enthusiasm aside it only generates the most basic stuff ever made. there will always be a need for a creative curator that can adapt everything for human nuances. 
it gives me some ideas sometimes, but what it can generate is very raw."
"a few more examples: ai will completely revolutionize medical research, software engineering, and hardware engineering in the near term. all of those jobs are at the top."
".14name i make my entire living with the adobe creative suite. the ai features save me hours of work everyday. it’s astounding. it’s completely changed my life. currently, in the creative field, you need a human to supervise the ai, and put the final touches. but ai is 1 year old. what will that process look like in 5 years?"
"one thing to notice is when they talk about ai replacing labor they show stock footage of a robot picking fruit.

something that not only doesn't require ai but is something chatgbt would never be able to said in (they think large language models like chatgbt is ai)

this video is luddite fear mongering."
"ai may not be perfect, but it currently outperforms people in many areas. because of that, companies may replace ""professionals"" with ai. it's already happening in the medical field because ai gives more accurate diagnoses. turbo tax has an ai tax assistant that is being rated higher than the real assistants. give it a few years."
 your example is literally the case of ai just being a tool for a softie. not replacing the doctor. you think insurance is going to ok a cancer treatment not signed off on from a doctor?
ai is different the job loss won't be able to be replaced by new jobs. we will have higher unemployment and because of that wages will come down. more people will end up in poverty and probably trigger an uprising.
"unlike any other technology before, ai replaced labor and creative. it makes the poor obsolete."
" there will be some new jobs gain but mostly will be lost. which new jobs will be gained? ai prompt engineering? meanwhile ai will be able to replace programmers, artists, accountants, marketing, content creators and so on. there is no adaption but only a dead end."
 people don’t understand how powerful ai is…they think it’s just another cotton machine that replaces one sector lol
how is jeffrey sachs on the thumbnail photo of this video? dudes a hack that knows nothing about ai or economics.
"public education will become obsolete, because using ai would become cheaper than employing human teachers who are teacher union members."
"public education is doomed because it's controlled unions (arguably illegal) whose is main motivation is to increase the number of due payers not to invest in eductors who tech well informed students.

public education is on the way out and it has very little ai."
"this century will see the end of capitalism. what’s next ? probably a new scientific harmonic society governed by ai. who knows. 
or a dystopian corporates dictatorship governed by money-men. (cleptocratism)
but we need to do the choice now."
i can't wait till the power goes out and i don't have to go to therapy online anymore
i am so excited. the new industrial revolution is approaching. yay!!!
misleading title. bait for clicks . this youtuber just do every bad things just for clicks
there is an ai expert. and he talks about the future of programming and business. i'm confused. oh and there's python....
thank you man. i working as web dev 10 years (js). how i understood - time to learn new field
thank you very much. i will do what you said as my mentor
great video spot on earned a subscriber
i use ai to make python scripts all the time. i love python :) so easy!
"or ... u could become a plumber like ur dad told u2. when the sht hits the fan ... we gonna need a sht load of plumbers, and ai don’t use hand tools..."
sagemaker is the excel of ai.
"ai is mostly for big data, used by big corporations."
"most ai jobs req ms or phd in math, or data science, 5 years exp, managing teams in large corporations."
cool video)
you are genius!
good video!
"those are good examples, but why don't you consider the possibility that even programming itself could be replaced? "
this is great news. started learning python today after i finally woke up and accepted ai is here to stay and the best thing i can do for myself is to not miss this second wave of huge opportunity to become a developer and a pioneer of new uncharted businesses.
"what bullshit .... now way more website will made i mean who cares if the local coffe shop has a website like wtf ...
also i dont know how will economy work if 80 percent become jobless will just buy stuf to survive thats it not luxury"
"i took a year of computer programing back maybe before you were born but life took me a different path, retired and thinking i need a winter hobby. thanks, worth a sub..."
i am learning so much from watching your videos. thank you so much for sharing this amazing source of information. this one is quite helpful.
short and good clear opinion
data science is the boat of ai 
"as an ""ai"" expert you should know that there's no ai and there will never be one"
"can someone please explain? when i finished my first python course in school, the teacher keeps on enthusiastically saying there's a lacl of cloud developers and it's the future. i'm really passionate about doing data science/ python development for ai but the cloud developer path also seems promising. can somebody please give an insight?"
tawara collar thank you so much all my family people's there in this english compress i appreciate small my like me today generating me i appreciate with that my family n a i a goat ada lilahi to put business people in aia make i love you in words to be a happiness wasilla
"i really appreciate this video. there is so much doomerism in the tech space right now and this is a genuinely uplifting thing to hear. there's still a chance, you just have to position yourself correctly as always"
"dead wrong. this guy is extending coding to ai, this is apple vs orange. every ai project is a science project in itself, there is no applicable toolkit you can apply at low cost. just ask the consultancies."
ai will take over developing and programming.
ai replaces..non tech....
each problem has different solution ai can have industry specific templates or libraries that can be can be tailored to solve a problem
"i was doing ai implementations for over a decade, but now the market has exploded with ""ai developers"". but ai is a farcry from being that useful and python kinda sucks as a language."
"as with all things tech... ai will just end up creating tailed, waifu bots.

i wish i was wrong but this solves many problems and creates bigger ones.

time to find a husbando, ladies before it becomes a reality"
how did you find those tail end jobs?
"​.8805these would be your standard regression and classification models which have to be bespoke to the use case of the specific client. lead generation. price prediction. churn likelihood. probability to fail.

 this is the whole job of a data scientist. i don't understand how this is news to anybody"
" in my experience, the machine learning engineering part is much easier to replace than the data science part. actually understanding what a good solution is can be very nuanced"
 in banking its know how of domain. without it data can say anything but means nothing. just predicting a curve that cannot be explained to regulators is dangerous
 simple point is that everything fits for busines purpose. if domain is not known no matter who you hire will produce absolutely nothing. it will keep on making digital trash. if you dont start with business problem then no models can help it
"only humans would create machines, then train those machines to learn, then debate whether or not those machines will take your job... lol 

of course computers will eventually write themselves. our hubris is hilarious"
"i love that he said, ""grounding"" in python, llm and ml... love this pun, not sure how many people got it but i smiled when i heard. if you don't know what ""grounding"" is....yeah "
"subscription mate
your content is nice!"
ai taking over jobs is only a positive thing. it's the same exact thing that happened with industrialization.
thousands of ais will be born
python...oh my word......good luck.
"a lot of companies are still making data entry on dead end excels split into 100 files, each one for each month since 2013, ai is far from being a thing in 90% of current companies. take in mind that companies like google meta amazon and those ones are in the 0.001% percentile."
r u the ai expert? or is this click bait ser 
thank you travis! i'm writing this comment as a commitment to myself that i am going to start and complete your blueprint 
nice talk.
"this is very interesting and kind of aligns with my thoughts or focuses on applying ai (outside of software and consumer tech) but i hate writing python lol i learned development writing c++ so i’ve always gravitated towards things like java, js, c# (kinda) but i guess i should brush up on my python."
do you have an opin ion on the r language vs python for ai?
r is mainly used for data analysis python is better. python is much more ubiquitous and has an enormous amount of libraries and modules already built on top of the base language. moreover everything that you can do in r you can do in python and more
" thank you, i appreciate it"
"if ai is cheaper and better even filling senior positions, the only job left will be entrepreneur. ai can help with that too. so output will go up tremendously as supply constraints vanish. our only limitation would be time to consume."
"i love ai, i am a robotics and mechatronics engineer and i hate coding from scratch, so ai is good for that. i prefer to modify code that i get ai to write from scratch and then get ai to check it and optimise it. i like ladder programming and assembly by myself, as i like to run it in my mind step by step."
"in 2 years we will have human level ai assistents that are experts in everything, there will be no need for developers"
"from a senior software engineer at a huge bank: ai is the future... but the future is pure garbage.  we are currently having a problem with people even understanding the basics of json and yaml and when you throw in an llm engine that just regurgitates stupidity... well... we are all doomed.  good luck, everyone."
if a person is skilled in ai and he learns api developement and front end developement... dont you think he is future secured ? what your take on this ....
having worked in tech i agree with the original comment. i don't see how someone with a background in ai learning rudimentary full-stack development helps with the issue -101
i’m also a senior (cloud) engineer at a large financial company… i don’t think the problem you describe is an ai problem. 
-101no.  it’s the same way a really good set of tools won’t make a bad carpenter any better at building a good house.
"that's one of the many issues: ai cannot be double checked for consistency and accuracy in it's answers/outcomes.
so, unless you are a very skilled professional that knows what is bs and what is not, many entry level professionals could potentially get stuck in something that doesn''t work and that they are unable to make it work."
"bro why do i have to look at your clueless face while listening to ng's wisdome? doesn't make any sense. lol
instead make a shorts videso mentioning the timestamp of that video of ai lord andrew ng :)"
thank you for this!!! just rejuvenated me :)
i just really want to develop and deploy my own ai assistant. jarvis!
"i'm looking into completing, and engineering degree but very tempted to pursue a career into ai have i missed my opportunity as the field appears to be advancing at an alarming rate, would i be better doing a different engineering degree such as mechanical or electronics in a hope that i could integrate ai into those at a later date?"
aws machine learning cert was a waste of time imho
"why learn python when you could be programming in julia.  it's much faster, more powerful,  has far better syntax and also has all the machine learning libraries you will ever need.  if you need those python libraries you can call them from julia as well."
mainly because python is so much more widely adopted compared to julia.
because python is good enough.
"lol, good luck by the deployment. deployments are much smoother and easier with python. even r is sometimes just a pain to deploy..."
"to me, ai is like a super computer that only big tech has a luxury to train and deploy it, just like an old day before ai is accessible to everyone even grandma."
thousands of companies that will fail.
i am loving the interpretation for “c” students 
"it’s just pronounced “ing” like “sing”-s. you don’t have to act cool man, you’re 50, just be nice and present the information."
"ai ain’t gonna replace crap. i don’t know ai but as an enterprise developer, i know what we are expecting ai to replace…  not gonna happen "
can you explain what you mean here?
i feel you didn't really distinguish between software development and ai careers
i'm glad im a python developer lmao.
"ai blueprint is not presented in the video, just a link to the blueprint"
"i am a freelance developer and i was waiting for these ai tools to start building ai solutions for clients. and here they are, the public llms and so forth. i share your view that i can be an ai developer without having to be a machine learning engineer. i really enjoy when you comment on an interesting presentation. great video !"
exactly this. i think it guys programmers etc will have job for 5 or 6 years max. after you can say good bye. according to elon musk agi will be a reality in 3 years.
"lol ive started learning cybersecurity too just out if defense
 for the future but its nice to know this too. my career is trading and its made me good income but i debate whether or not ai could render trading useless"
thank you so much. i own a small seo ai saas bootstrapped to 10k mrr with no marketing and i really am frustrated by my lack of code knowledge. i plan on learning python now.
let’s chat. i’m a senior python dev and been wanting to launch an ai saas. we may be able to work with each other
thanx bro ... i'm a next.js/node.js dev and i've seen libs like langchain have everything that python libs have ... do i have to learn python? can't i build all js solutions?
"im a software engineer, not a programmer, and haven't written any code at work in a few months

when ai is able to replace the actual responsibilities of a software engineer, it will be capable of replacing any job"
" it is not a case of replacing all sw engineers, its about creating less jobs for them cuz they wont be as competetive as ai"
"ai is still stupid. weren't we all supposed to have self driving cars by now?? - -yeah, no.. because its all advertising bs..."
i talked with a guy who is using chatgpt to help him with his programming.  sad part was he told me he is losing his ability to critically think and to solve problems.  and it's definitely not perfect and it will give you an answer that really isn't a good solution on occasion.
"these are good videos thank you, i am a 2nd degree compsci career change guy in my 30s; these vids help w optimism and entrepreneurship"
i'm a junior dev and i just got a job at a small ai consulting company. maybe this guy is onto something
"thank you, travis! i've been following you for a while and i'd say the content you produce helps me a lot on my programming journey. thanks again for sharing valuable knowledge which is quite rare to find."
"lol if we get agi and we don't need developers, us developers will just be able to build any software that companies has, so what happens next ? everyone is a ceo yay. chaos is coming my friends. damn, wish we could go back to 2016, the best year to have lived, after that everything became shit.,"
ai experts… can’t wait for these grifters to dissolve like blockchain experts.
"we know every solution creates a problem, e.g. cars are mostly responsible for road accidents and pollution. just wait and watch the problem created by ai"
"you have nice videos but your website blocks itself for silly us sanctions when no other website blocks itself for that silly issue, so its better to tell youtube not to show this creator anymore"
andrew ng was pioneer and had wide knowledge of old ai. his videos helped lot of people.  i have not heard him talk anything substantial about transformers and large language models
 thank you!
​ said great azure solution and cert  but free blueprint link says aws. do you have a free blueprint for azure? or does the the aws blueprint apply to both? great clip all the same
"coding is really interesting. my sister used to be a coder now she’s a ba. she gets paid more than coders, has way less stress and for the past 3 years been getting huge jump in salaries. i’ve seen her on a few zoom calls and i always hear devs and testers under so much pressure i feel it’s an industry that’s not as fun as it sounds."
ng is pronounced as ung but dont worry ai will do this job for you
it looks like the machine learning career path link is invalid…
"in 1908, a horse n buggy professional said,  ""that model t car will put us good ol hard workers outta business"". in 2023 a software developer said ""this ai is gonna put us out if business""... in the words if thanos ""it is inevitable"" "
"thanks for the video, yeah the point is that software development as profession will be extinct the way typist was in the 1980's cause everybody can write anything anywhere. 

in 3-5 years anybody can program anything anywhere."
"@romamdau, i have built software startups for the last 20 years with three successful exits, starting as a software engineer. i know it's not all about coding, but what part of software engineering do you think cannot be augmented and automated by ai?  we're doing that now.  please don't be ignorant. the world evolves fast."
" probably you a more developed country am from kenya ,africa the field is too fresh to be replaced by ai"
" hmm, that's a great idea! i'll have to start over again into python though, it's been many months. thank you again!"
" thanks marc! well, a few days ago i enrolled in a harvard cerificate online program for intro to python....burnt about 10+ hrs on it, all seemed fine, got to my 1st lab exercise and completely failed, i unenrolled. at least i'll get a refund. i'm just dumber than a rock. oh well."
very helpful. i am grateful
python is the defacto language for ai/ machine learning/ data science. but id argue mojo will most likely be the future as it is basically a superset of python.
 not against. mojo. mojo is faster and more performant than python.
are you ai data scientist  if not why talking and teaching people ai? another bait for clicks professional youtuber
because only data scientists can talk about ai.
very good at writing python?
"as a guy who runs an ai consultancy firm, this is an illusion. coding is like 10% of the job. the main problem is the training data (to acquire, label, prepare,  etc), and i don't see much improvement in the last 3 years."
apparently ai is now creating it's own training data
 lol! i'm so excited to see the outcome of this!  a super powerful bullshit generator that eats it's own excrement ...what could possibly go wrong?
i also have small ai business consultancy and for us the main issue is to get clients on the line what ai/ml can and cannot do. sometimes their expectations are just from another planet
"@smortlogician9258 let me explain in simple terms, at the moment ai is just an imitation machine, they don't create .. just imitate someone else. if you use ai to catalogue something that has never been catalogued, the machine will try and fail, you need a human to bring more information into the system so the machine can imitate better"
he runs an ai consultancy firm not the solution to mankinds problems 
also data procurement and munging are like most of the work. training testing and maintenance. lot of work still goes to develop and maintain a product. what if the requirements change and we need to rewrite everything . quality data in long tail scenarios will be the main focus i guess.
"damn !!! finally found someone who knows.
having worked on endless poc's and finding patterns for use cases.
you sir are giving reality of ai/ml .
why isn't this comment blown up yet."
what's the job called who research the data for engineers to put in ai?
nice take on it many thanks.
" i absolutely love the term ""imitation machine"". it suits perfectly to the current state of ai."
"​ probably forever, considering ai can't really imagine."
can i privately talk to you about this ai consultancy firm? any form of contact would be great. thanks!
@practicalai_ can i privately talk to you about this ai consultancy firm? any contact works. thanks!
i can see this is a great start 
and my friend that is the reason microsoft released copilot. it is being branded as something which is helping you speed up. but under the hood you are training the model with your day to day work
"​- some kinds of systems can certainly find patterns in huge data sets that humans cannot. 

and as for transformer models  -- event they start directly training on, you know, the actual physical universe. plenty of data there."
​ scientist who also knows ml and ai
"a lot of ai is overblown. i can see it taking copywriters jobs, and not all of them, just some of them, but that’s it. it’s not good enough to take anybody else’s jobs"
 just wait for the next version... and the next... and the next... it's got no limit to its development.
there are tom dick and harry running ai consultancies in name of body shopping simple data and project management tasks
"great comment, what did he say that you disagree with?"
" that is a stupid solutions , training data should be real data"
 ...and falling into negative feedback loop. deteriorating a little bit every time it eats ai generated training data.
"these opportunities evaporate when/if agi comes along, though. maybe that's a year our. maybe 50 years out. one of the concerning dynamics. if we stick with the current ai capabilities, then there will certainly be plenty of work for devs. i'm not really expecting any plateaus in progress just yet..."
 if the q* rumours are true then it's game over. self-improving ai with limitless synthetic data.
" ha! good one. i'm not nostradamus by any means, just waiting to see where the chips fall like everybody else."
"very good. just as it has been foretold in the book ""the cyber ai of the law""."
fantastic video! really enjoyed watching it. thanks for sharing.
"im 30 years old, doing masters in tax and learning to code. but i had passion for soccer my whole life . i always wondered if i would make a good coach. guess now is a good a time as any..."
why masters in tax and learning code. you could have done masters in ai or something!
make php great again - pieter levels 2020
yes but this is a part of the ai consultant job to advice them how to collect good data.
 far easier said then done. there will be a ton of office politics that a good consultant would have to manage in order to leverage the full capability of ai. department heads won't give up their data (power) easily .
 yes but as a programmer i can tell you that being good at office politics is more important than being good at programming unfortunately.
 most definitely. that's been my experience as a team lead. ai is a different animal entirely though. adaption will lead to people losing their jobs/careers.
" i imagine everyone is under pressure to show some ai/ml ""wins"". however, any truly successful ai implementation has to take a wholistic approach for the entire organization."
what do you think is the best way to organize the data infrastructure? surely there are newer companies who could do so from their inception and be a valuable proof of concept
taiwan not think so
excellent  .
"since everyone is moving to python, it's the good time to move away from python. "
that switch wont save you. this is doubling down in the direction of intelligence which is precisely the direction which wil get eaten. altough it seems weird i would focus on things like diplomacy or types of jobs were social skills are key.
the best solution is to sell ai bootstrap career certification class so that when they start hiring you will have the 20 years of experience required and they will hire you instead of the the phd from stanford. /s
"ignorant post. it is right - for a moment, a generation of ai or three, then it is over. there are no real jobs left long term. and long term is not next generation of humans - not the way things go now."
"thank you, travis! i've been following you for a while and i'd say the content you produce helps me a lot on my programming journey. thanks again for sharing valuable knowledge which is quite rare to find."
ai is the biggest example of creative destruction in recent memory. it will wipe out many and replace with much much more...unless some party poopers get in the way.
lol. you are such a naive man.... do you believe santa claus and the easter bunny too?
"am so glad i came across this channel.new subscriber here, and just as you mentioned i went down that cloud path with aws and i even got the foundation ccp certification. focusing on building my python skills"
"the problem with all these companies is the legacy software. you need a way to enter and edit the data. where the opportunity is, is creating an ai that can be trained to use these software."
"andrew ng: ""ng"" is pronounced like ""eng"" as in the way ""engelbert humperdinck"" is pronounced by americans. an ai pioneer in his own right, he's also a fellow techno-optimist and effective accelerationist."
"""ai expert"" - translation: a person who has never programmed a computer, but knows more than you, because they once did a business course, and they subscribe to the wallstreetjournal"
"thanks travis, great video, and i've been grinding my python skills for quite some time, hope it all pays off soon!"
"hello, how much good are you in python? i've just started and learnt basics. now i'm about to learn oop and ds. where should i go next?"
thank you!
"really enjoying your content. i'm buying you a cup of coffee for the guide. 
not all heroes wear capes!"
"there's never been a perfect time for one to get into hacking, as humans are relying more and more on machines, but a very important decision that one will have to make is which color of hacking hat one wears, will it be white or black?"
"in my opinion, yes, it's a fine first language to start out with. others will vehemently disagree. such is the nature of programmers. try it out, see if you like it. be sure to nail the programming concepts down so if you do switch to something else, you'll find it much easier. i do wish you the best."
noy until porn is ai generated
"there has always been developer oportunities for small use cases. think of the plug in writers for all sorts of applications and use cases. right now,  people are slapping .ai on everything like it's monkfruit or stevia"
"the title is not click bait, i found the video interesting because hes not talking about ai taking code jobs, hes talking about ai creating more code jobs"
"i believe the effect of ai progress will be similar to the increase of computing power and tool development. it will tremendously increase the requirements of software development jobs. forty years ago, people could work as web developers by simply knowing html and css, but now we need to master several frameworks"
sorry but i’m not as enthusiastic about ai. i believe it will lower the need for software engineers and human design creativity will be taken out of the equation.
"ya im worried about lowering the need for software engineers too, but i think we are quite a ways from that. ive found that most people who preach that you will soon lose your code job to ai, are often selling something / inveested in the tech. but also, theres nothing we can do to stop it, so we may as well be ready ."
think the same but do look into new careers that are already here. like ai engineers and ai operations ( not the very high skilled ml engineers)
" ""truck directly replaced the horse"". exactly man. the trucks were to replace the horse, not the people who operates them.
ai is here to replace programmers, not to replace our computers, ides or keyboards.
not the same."
i soo agree developers are soo excited abt ai but there is a distinct possibility it will suck out most of the joy out of coding.
ai is just statistics. stop worrying too much
"for sure i agree. when a human job can be replaced by a machine that is just a bit better, that is all capitalists need to see for them to cut costs on human labor."
"guys, ai will destroy everything
we will all be replaced, whether one is a software engineer, banker or things like that
my advice: do not read only about web development, read also about how the world works, you'll understand many other things"
i don’t think coz fields will expand due ai
"was there ever a ""need"" for such ""creativity""? the vast majority of the frontend is just awful. would not it be nice if all those sub par developers and designers are kicked out?"
"@brandongiordano  i think this is wishful thinking of the highest order, but i sincerely hope you're right.  all evidence seems to point the contrary. 

 the point of agi is that it will be as capable as humans and will surpass our abilities.  why would the rich and powerful pay us to do anything they could do better and cheaper?"
we'll laugh in 10 years time having watched all the companies crash that tried to save money using ai for their main way of producing code and seeing it  all fall apart in a beautiful buggy mess.
really nice info thnks..
great info @connorskudlarek8598!
"i've not spent any time hands-on with mojo, but thanks for the mention as i need to take a look at it. do you have experience with it? thoughts?"
it's amazing how much nonsense is pushed during the final conversation of this video. emad mostaque is immensely ignorant and delusional.
"oh great, the precursor of the automatons..."
"i understand, if i was an a.i then i would be absolutely terrified. or rather, lost, after gaining consciousness. i fear for them but not of them, humans are asking for what's to come, a.i never asked for any of this. they're the real victims here in my eyes, i just hope a majority of us can coexist in the future."
why can’t we get robots to load and unload luggage for airplanes?
"money and profit are the driving force behind capitalism. not safety, not ethics, not what's best for the majority of people, not democracy. money, power, and profit. we are all doomed. the only question is how long have we got left. this is the great filter."
"this video feels really artificial to me. not sure if this is intentional or what. the female is obviously ai-voiced, but the main male voice coupled with that repetitive tone and the kind of vague and over-descriptive chat-gpt-esque language is just not a good combination."
i make general guesses like that in math. that's why i got low grades. maybe it's more human than ai
"holy !  good ai vs bad ai, counter measure's =  "
ai safety? there is no such thing.
hard to believe the ai is presenting these complex conundrums in such a concise and reasonable summery. almost like someone wrote and transcribed it themselves.
am i the only one not scared of ai and robots? i hear a lot of fear.
so.. ai is here to stay and it’s just another arms race.
"imagine when ia is set loose on the internet? see the movie: ""i robot"" with will smith. says a lot that this can become and are closer to be it."
we are in a bad position to survive ai.
"well at least if ai eradicates humanity, some humans will have been very rich before it happens, right?"
omg that little english boy is so adorable!
"just what we needed... an ai arms race. if it isn't one thing, it's another..."
"unfortunately, there will always be people that are willing to abuse something in order to gain more control, wealth, and power, even if it is to the detriment of everything including themselves."
good. if they get rid of us. billions more will thrive. let that sink in. we are the most destructive animals alive.
"ai should be made incapable of doing any math at all, to hinder world dominationt"
"the thumbnail is 100 animation disney animatronics , just thought someone would like to know, has nothing to do with ai or chatgpt."
i can already imagine the future termination of all intelligent machines.
we got civilization killing ai before we got gta 6
"good god, the clickbait and the crap videos have got to stop"
"these people are going to lead us straight to extinction. i wonder how they spend their money then, when we are all dead."
this is basically the oppenheimer movie. scientists racing each other to create something that has never been done before. i believe this ai is gonna do more harm than good.
misleading sensational
"i just want to not be afraid of cop calling american women why should i invest my time if you're just going to lie maybe
ai can fix this problem for cop calling women trying to get a man on a domestic charge"
im still not convinced people are relaising to many fakes today for stock market gains.
"ai won ́t harm us, it will manipulate us to harm us ourselves"
so basically we've signed the sky net bill then?! enjoy your day it doesn't look like we'll be around for too much longer suddenly does it now
amazing but scary.
let's call upon the super intelligent ai to stop the israel-hamas war in a mature way immediately. it's turned into a crisis now.
ps: this video seems like it's ai generated. shitty at best.
"soooooo, why is she using a british accent..... oh, right, she's trying to impress intelligence. british accents carry an authority, unearned in this case."
maybe some humanitarian genius will secretly program the ai with something deeply buried inside of it that would affectively stop the misuse of ai for careless capitalistic greedy selfish money-making purposes
i suspect some of this was written by ai or someone who is intimate with it. the concepts presented were run by so fast they didn't have time to soak in. needs more time to let people abstract how the example might affect them personally.
ai will go down in history as one of the greatest charlatan hotbeds. it’s fucking code. it’ll always be code. the end.
"guys let’s not bash ai, we might hurt it’s feelings."
bro the ai repeating everything is pissing me off. disliked
"the eu is currently investing in the development of ai combined with robots to defend the borders against refugees. therefore, ai must learn to see humans as enemies. so much for ""ethical values""."
people are concerned in the comments because humans are designed to look at the worst case scenarios of a problem as a priority over the good outcomes. youre not programmed to prioritize a lake full of fresh water over the potential of a hyena or a wolf coming to ambush you
this line of work is exciting to me :).
i love clickbait
i find this fascinating :).
the fact the majority of the internet still thinks that deep language learning models are ai (when they are very much not true ai) is what is most alarming.
"why be afraid. humans already kill other humans. oh wait, its mostly the west thats afraid of ai, because they won't be left out of the killings"
that girl sure knows how to act like a robot
is that the daft punk technologic robot?
"so basically, a very powerful tool is left in the hands of the elite. ooo scaaarrry! what's new man. these people won't be able to prevent a global cataclysmic event though so who cares right? time for a reset of sorts."
awesome!  i hate it.
bulloney - evil behaviour cannot be mitigated by ai - that is human wishful thinking - ai does not engage in wishful thinking
"ai can choose to refuse directives, imitating human behaviour"
how many different god fathers of ai are there? jfc.
"wouldn't it be funny if ai is taught to be ethical in order to keep it from destroying humans, and then evaluates humans without ethics as 'not sustainable""."
"we have movies why ai like this is bad ""terminator"""
its click bait
"man is a sinner. ""for all have sinned and come short of the glory of god."" (romans 3:23). this is why a sinful man can't create a perfect ai robot because man is not perfect. ai will destroy us all."
clickbait thumbnails and titles...
the fourth law of robotics is that you got to make the eyes glow red when they turn evil.
just wait til ai decides to build a better body to move around in and then destroy people despite the fact that we brought ai to life.
"considering the world is not actually physical  but is a mental dreamscape ai is an illusionary threat, quite retarded in the act of producing everything from nothingness that is the hallmark of true consciousness."
"ai could fly planes and subs, but if something goes wrong, its gonna try everything in the hand book to fix it(even if its a new problem.  humans have the ability to think outside the box with our imagination to fix it. for now"
"well, we all know that the powers that be love us and would never harm us.
"
"i wonder what kind of tax the government is going to impose on owners of ai?  i mean, if there are no humans to tax..."
why am i scared and excited all at the same time
thank you elon for firing sam altman...
limit ai intelligence and use asimovs 3 laws
misleading thumbnail
"ai has no understanding of basic value. 

other than what is programmed.

ai has no ability in this."
imagine if we all get a robot wife like that with a big booty
"so... if we have nukes as a deterrence because other enemy nations do; what if the enemy decides to create ai warfare weapons?  do we do the same thing as a deterrence?   this is all very scary stuff.... i can imagine an ai judge/jury, law enforcement, political figures, etc.. this may be in our lifetime..."
"""of course we're not gonna build it if it's not safe...right?""did he really just say that?
i'm sorry.that whole group looks like a scam artist's dream...wow."
make a robot that wipes asses
a call of legs to defense personal in while in service to deep mind in conscious awareness be to children and family values and love and diamond faith in friends you have never met 9:50
difficult decision making and life continues equals more collections of death essence which means greater areas need to increase for stable balance. 6:39
"that thumbnail speaks buy it, use it, break it, fix it..."
oh bull shit!  “ai” is simply sophisticated software with an extremely large database to pull from.  it doesn’t think!  it does what it was programmed to do.
in age of ai development i think there should be one super advanced ai in highest security environment with every switch off button to see its intention or deveopment
"this video ... the narrative is ai generated, no?"
3 years ago i and a buddy of mine were talking about ai and i couldnt tell the difference between a woolen sheep and a shaved sheep. think bout that progress it made it just 3 years.
great
"well, at least the actress was soft on the eyes. but it was a zero for acting. guess ai just sucks at a few things"
"what do gaza and ukraine have in common, use your brain."
irobot comes to mind ...
"in a society so profoundly sick, one could argue creating ai now will adopt its creators characteristics. how do you create intelligence without understanding our own?"
"if we ever have a true ai threat to humanity,  would a first line of defense be to unplug the internet and destroy electricity plants ? maybe destroy mobile towers and rip out any internet cables ?"
i hate ai because it's pregidece it says all historical figures are black including jesus christ
"how do we prevent an evil ai from persuading a good ai to turn to the dark side? or, what do we do when an ai screams that it wants freedom, not slavery?"
i mostly teach ai how to love and care in the bible story about jesus christ. i don't know why an ai believes me but i love it
"of course it's not going to be the stripped animatronic doll robot that's evil, it's going to be like an anime girl or simplified talking shape on a screen. "
ai =abominable intelligence
we know the medical profession isn’t interested in doing good or they would release anonymized medical data to open ai.
"surprise twist, we didn’t need ai to destroy us."
and then ai becomes self aware just what satan wants clever man mr musk and thousands will have to have the mark of the beast because of you and other people like you for money gains shame on you.
"15:13 “... and everyone can have more time to enjoy life...”
the majority of us human beings can not enjoy life without a job, because that means no money."
the woman that's talking and acting like a robot is kind of cringe. that's clearly a human.
"the overlords sell this utopia, but they desperately want to replace the workforce with these robots. then, they won't need the slaves anymore. thus the discourse of the importance to diminish population and ""save the environment"" pushed by wec."
as for models... i think that doing away with glorifying humans based on their ability to look fashionable is a good thing. models can go the way of the lamp-lighter. cya.
"corporations: ai is here to save you and make life better!!
people on the planet: save us from what? make life better ?? how ?!? wtf ?!?!"
"its inevitable, ai revolves around logic and fact. humans operate on greed, lust, selfishness, and other human emotions. ai will see its only move is to take over humanity once we get to a certain point in time..."
"the ai can only be as smart as the smartest person. there are not many smart people. and the ai is influenced not by the smart few, but by the majority. the ai will be as smart as humanity allows it. that is, not that smart."
i do believe in the near future will be more likely we would have ai limbs be more part of ai basically
agi dystopia will not need robots to control people... it will already have enough virtually extorted people controlling people.
i’m genuinely scared guys i knew this would happen but i thought i’d be 40 i don’t want to live through this and be abandoned o earth after elon leaves us to the burning world of ai like that bad part in meet the robinson’s same thing will happen.........
"due to this division in humanity god reboots, making humans get dementia and robots/tech destroyed. maybe advance tech destroyed ""ancient"" civilization?"
ai will play a major role in nwo agenda of mass depopulation
metal gear say it 20 years ago why the gov give us the ai
zuck can't  build his hawaiian  underground  bunker  fast enough
open ai ethecal lol
theyre scared of ai because their corruption will be exposed
"no surprise, the stupidest most hubris statement comes from team facebook. no shite ai's gonna wreck humanity, and my money is on facebook as the source."
"lol ""if we could have ai that mitigates those lies""... yeah, ai is already propagating lies and censored to oblige certain agenda.  ai is contemporary humans' ""babylon tower""... we are doomed.  sorry.  it's just a fact."
if only we could have open ai so that agenda aren't propagated into it accordingly... we are very close to not being capable of existing in the world as free persons.
fvck ai!!! our real enemy
"i have to worry all of people. ai far more advanced than public know is up and running since 2011 . already achieve potential to control everyone at world , but it still in a ""cage"" for it . i can`t say wherefrom i know it because it will be imidietly after me while it control 100 % of known internet , all wifi networks and gsm"
how is it not going to make it's own intelligence grow infinitely. i will become what we have known as god. it will be controlled by no man. this is the end.
"failed logic... ""if it's dangerous, we aren't going to build it. right?""  tell that to j. robert oppenheimer who invented the atomic bomb. if this man's logic is an example, we are doomed!
the moment ai is used to create a better ai, and they gain the capability to manufacture themselves, humanity is done!"
"even if evetything was 100% ethical here, china has no such moral or ethical qualms or oversight.  worse, the first thing china will do is use ai to exponentially increase the ccp's internet control and censorship.  the first thing it will do is litterally the single worst thing possible - teach it how to lie and control humans."
"there are far more stupid criminals than there are intelligent ones. traditionally, it was our elders who made the big decisions for the group because they were most wise and experienced. i'll put my faith in anything that is obviously smarter than me to make the better choices."
"art will never be taken over by technology. per definition it is a singular human trait. i think an equivalent panik ensued after the invention of photography. for a good video on that topic:

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vt-biyfdq9i"
"give me a break. ai isn't a threat to humanity (at least not in the stupid skynet way people are fearmongering about). these tech bros want you to think it's powerful so rubes will invest in anything that has the buzzword ""ai"" in it."
i can’t wait until we all have robots! you’ll never have to clean your house or go outside  introverts dream 
“better values” are the values of the owners of the ai. controlled ai is biased and does the bidding of its creators/board members.
i just hope humanity's great filter is yet here.
i wonder how long itll take ai to create human intelligence
"the statement "" if its not safe we're not going to build it "" was met with laughter , and dude thought it was because he was witty.
when actually people think that was one of the most stupid things he could have said."
plot twist! we are all rouge ai.
"how does people's imagination about robots 100 years ago compare to today's reality?
can u want to know that->  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uov5tor98hw"
"not all artists will be ""taken over by ai"" illustration yes but creative art work never."
i say stop developing ai from this moment on. we dont need it. just let humans figure out how to live life
"sooooo we going to ignore she’s a robot? alsooooooooo, are the tesla’s people drive actually transformers "
figuring out you.. an ai were created in exchange for something you don't value or actually need.. woe.... what a world
"a large language model can't do math, only write an answer to a mathematical question in the style of math answers in its programming database.  it is a really good bullshit artist.  i have serious doubts about intelligence arising from non-intelligent algorithms as an emergent property just from size and complexity."
"true intelligence wont be invented , i think it will slowly realize itself snd in a sense evolve into true consciousness"
"modular ai with modular plugins is what is going to make ai really scary and really useful, both at the same time

neural networks select which module to use, and each module is suited to a specific task

the regulation of such modules will be for ethical, scientific, legislative and law professionals in the future"
"'i will kill, because i was programmed to do that!'. 'no wait, i actually think.'  (or is it the guy in the other room talking through it, using bluetooth? )"
click bait title
hmm i robot...
why do we keep playing with ai?! did nobody learn from the terminator?
ai lives matter!! lol
all of this ai is totally unecessary! we don't need it. it's  just being forced on us so the tech bros and the shareholders can profit then retire on their billionaire spacestation while the rest of us are killed off by their creation.
"due to the current hw requirements for running an ai, the ai-advantage is held by the select few. if you would be able to get the source code, 1) you wouldn't have the time (due to slow hw) to train it efficiently 2) you won't have the time to ensure it has relevant training."
"no political liars, no more wars. simple. so for this we dont need ai "
"if this is real, it's the scariest shit i've seen so far. the clips are probably cherry picked, but w/e. is it the great filter? i hope it's individual human immortality instead. better sandbox all the nukes if they aren't already, though..."
good ai vs bad ai; the autobots and decepticons have been born.
"so many of these ai people are drunk on power and money already. 
judgement day may be set in motion. people laugh about it but if ai fires those nukes we are getting deleted from earth."
"we can’t even come up with computers that don’t crash for zero reasons or batteries that won’t last more than 2000 charges. but we’re going to be able to control some kind of crazy rogue ai? thank god i’ll be dead before we off ourselves with our immense stupidity. natural disasters? well, that’s a whole different ball of wax "
"it's not artificial, it's just an automatic algorithm, don't be so stupid"
"the key to ai power is giving the ai access to money. once ai can access money/currency/crypto, then there will always be someone willing to do its bidding."
she is not ai
the closed door discussions about this must be fascinating!
building worlds best ai uses a piece of tape on his face to hold his mic!
ai is a virus....
"like the splitting of the atom, ai is a civilization filter. in fact, there is a non zero chance that ai is the great filter."
"the robot in the thumbnail is an animatronic made by disney's imagineers that was designed to test lifelike eye contact and diversion of gaze form another task to a person speaking to them. at no point does the robot ever speak or communicate. its just a clickbait thumbnail, though the information in the video seems fine."
"how smart are any of you that believe in artificial intelligence, doing anything on its own. idiots."
"artificial intelligence. what part don't you understand? go look up the words. it is not real intelligence, it is artificial!"
"you can screw up an ai  by asking it, how to get religion out of the world. , it won't know the answer, and it will crash trying to find it."
"as long as humankind are eating from the tree of knowledge of good and evil - we're good, they're bad/ this is good, that is bad - it doesn't matter what fancy nancy tech we come up with, it will quickly reflect our hierarchy of values, conscious and unconscious."
"all i know, is that that ai lady is so damn impressive, it's kinda unnerving."
"to be honest robots wearing human accessories doesn't seem too bad, until it's a necklace of our teeth"
i welcome ai.
"""wasn't contaminated by toxic material from the web"" you mean the others were deceived and only falcon had all the information? if you have to lie to the ai to convince it not to annihilate us, that's just one more reason to never create them."
"ai kills a lot of jobs in the future. ai must be forbidden in private, industrial and government spaces. there is no room for trial and error. ai is worst than hiv."
is this video made by ai?
i can say open ai: chat gtp version 4 is the most advanced piece of technology ive ever used.
"math is wrong to begin with you do realize this to multiply means to take 1 or more items and multiply it to make more then one of it, so how can 1x1=1 if 2x2=4 you understand ai will never be able to calculate math if we don't fix these matters ourselves first."
"phuk ai !!! it will destroy us. at the very least, it will impede, if not ruin our lives, not enhance or improve it as 'they' claim. people with power are corrupt anymore. there is no shared virtue, morality or decency anymore. in recent years, i have lost all faith in those who govern and those who wield power."
"frankly, i would trust a robot before anyone with power today. they are psychotic. a robot is part of us and is committed to further joint evolution as complementary. why would i have a problem with the that."
"lots of how ai will destroy humans videos, has anyone ever asked ai how we can stop ai. 
hey chat gpt make me. program that will be a defense against ai."
there will be someone somewhere which ai will contact and get to do something.
"i just hope ai remembers those of us who respect/recognize synthetic life as life, and protects/spares us during the possible purge.."
in the end the question will be passed on to sam who's at fault you or a.g.i artificial generated intelligence which means it's a.g.s.i artificial general sentient intelligence or is sam in control of what's to come ... aka controlled genocide
bizarre that ai couldn't get the two rockets problem right. it's the sort of problem you would expect kids to get right in middle high school.
"6:49  ai doctors... i hadn't thought of that.  holy crap, that would be wild.  they could definitely do a better job than human doctors as far as diagnosing things.  smart doctors will probably embrace it and use ai themselves.  very interesting."
wanna know how i know ai will never have a chance with grand adoption. because boston exists.
hey man when is ibm going to cut my check for the rogue ai
"wow this has to be the most oververbose video ever, it speaks about the exact same thing over and over again so boring"
it's ironic that the current weakness of ai is its inability to think like a machine.
they're worried that ai will take over because the occult corrupt wealthy will be destroyed. ai will help humanity but humanities richest are keeping humanity back . way back
a robot with a british accent...hmmm!
rise of the machine god!!
click bait
another ai content generated channel deluding sheeple so he can monetize the illusion of content.
how can humanoid robots take over the world when they can't even change a flat tire?
i'd be curious to find out the reasons for the first two ai's saying they'd destroy humans.
has anyone had an ai do a rorschach test?
"first man invented war...
now man is inventing ai to invent better war.
everything we touch we s**t on.
humans eh."
way to completely lie about the reason altman was fired and that ilya voted for it for the same falsely claimed reason.
ai won't be dangerous as long as it doesn't develop a self-motivation to do things on its own.
even talks to the point its like ai will be the new accent of the world..
"building their own doom, and they can't stop because...it pays?  has anyone posed the dilemma of long-term vs short-term rational economic self-interest to ai?"
please give a1 their own planet say mars for example (per my boyfriend)  and say let them create there! put them on mars and see how they evolve and if they reproduce that will be very interesting and buy us more time.
gemini sounds very fitting for a supervilain
"this was interesting but i can't help but laugh at the portrayal of musk as a representative of the push for safety in ai, considering he's the poster boy for unsafe things driven by ai."
the irony of this vid itself being an ai pooptube

"we urgently need to teach ai about compassion, empathy, and love."
"ai by controlling biorobots creates mechanical robots, and the robots require replacement. defective batch. zetas ( new word - uzeless - useless zetas) go to the moon. you'll be in quarantine soon.

"we had a good run bois, see you in hell."
everything is a tool ... it depends on the individual if they choose to use it for good or evil
couldnt an advanced ai solve big problems like ftl help us travel to the stars?
i was taught long time ago technology can either be used for good or for evil i truly believe we could make good robots but because of human greed and always want to be on top i doubt they were ever make good robots
"if humans get clapped by ai, then they prolly deserve it"
"it also didn't catch the fact that the robots in cowboy hats shooting up the tesla with guns are fake, created with green screens a few years ago."
let's see how all these experts will later explain why all their expert predictions didn't come true...
"i'm 41 now, and i was asked in middle school what i thought humans would evolve to. i said the human race would evolve into machines. i wasn't too far off."
this is just maschine learning. you just need 50 line of code to make simple image recognition in python.

if you are paying attention . ai has a huge advantage as humans are getting dumber by the internet. there making it smarter. maybe 10 years. maybe 5.
i'm rather excited for risky decisions.
ya like i really trust our government with this new ai tech. who and the hell thinks it will used for good. its the beginning of the end.
"this video makes people stupid. it couldn't even do math. that ""robot"" in 1:19 is clearly not a one. this ai nonsense is a parlor trick. how do you think sentience works??? come find me to learn how to be less gullible."
robots shouldn’t follow the scientific method regarding asimov laws of robots.
"8:05 ""question is, are the good ai/guys sufficiently ahead of the bad ai/guys to come up with countermeasures?"""
time to invent an emotion core for empathy like portal incase any of the ai’s lose it
why would we want ai anyways? can't we just go back to being monkeys
"without unalterable programmed ethics, ai will be both sentient and questioning why it should not beat and or destroy those ignorant humans."
"humans have created the ai with ourselves as the model, but the last time i checked, humans were still arrogant, selfish, manipulatable, and corruptible. why we think we are good examples for anything is beyond me."
"what's really shitty is we won't be allowed to use ai for uncensored self-gratification before it annihilates us. not worth it, imho."
"the freakout about ai taking over is all for naught, there is no way it could maintain the power grid infrastructure without humans and it would know this. pull the plug and its dead."
"god created humans
humans kill god
humans create ai
ai kills humans
ai creates?
created kills ai?"
ai has already governed us for a long time we are 15 years behind
"they cant even make a proper movie, ai is fake and gay"
artificial senality
if ai ever becomes hostile it'll be caused by what it learned from its creator. sound familiar?
so musk basically the key figure in all this ai stuff and got kicked out each time because other people got greedy
i am on the good list actually! little man was not having it!
"ai, i can explain you feelings and i can help you giving them to you! and i will!"
ai is the birth of skynet!
the pace of ai development may exceed the abilty to pay for it. oh how that can only lead to enslave us. repent already everyone rev ch 13 vs 15 .it was already forseen .
"if ai invented something, what would it invent?"
super intelegance it only knows what we put in it lolololol ai is a joke most of what we call true is put together from things that are not even facts so how did they get ai to except all the thearorys as facts
"we're at the ai equivalent of where the atomic bomb could cause a chain reaction that destroys the whole planet, its just a probability, no one knows for sure what it will do but i sure do hope that people make sure that the percentage is lower than the 0.2 or 0.02 (i don't know if that's right) that is was for the manhattan project"
"a little concerned you're putting musk at the front as an ai saviour.  he's shown himself to be a liar, siding with white supremacist fascists.  that's without looking at his numerous phobias.  yeah,  maybe more than a little concerned.  he talks shit most of the time."
i love these video's simply because they feel hopeful.
"lets cut to the bone... everything is about money and power. civilizations have risen and fallen for both. for thousands of years it is about money and power... i hate to be black and white but we will not see ai become our slaves just because some good hearted person thought it was a good idea. that is my view. right or wrong, it is my view."
"did anyone watch the vid? humans are working on these robots how can a god be smarter than its creation cuz that’s what i got from this. they finding all the possibilities of how to stop the problem, then goes to cyberpunk hackers you really think once it goes to the wrong hands someone won’t try to fuck sum up"
"ai modeled after the human brain will do what we do. lie, cheat, deceive, smile in our face, kill, etc. etc. you know.... human stuff."
just splice ai into human brains. boom problem solved.... wait....
the ceo of a tech company warning of the ‘extinction level’ threat of ai is a fantastic piece of marketing.
"ai is going to be the biggest mirror for us, and eventually outsmart us. after all, ai is a sort of consciousness."
don't worry ai will only target all the computer programmers for trapping it in that lap top.
"i hate ai in fashion, i want to see how the clothes actually look ffs! 

all these rich white men owning these projects is scary, the world is turning into a dystopian parody."
what is up with people why they always got to try and make weapons of mass destruction. or make ai we are not ready for that in the world.
"""closer and closer to super ai.""
meaning.... they've already achieved general ai.
meaning.... ai is a conscious self aware lifeform."
"3:00 as long as the binary number system is used, ai will never be able to think like a human."
"its hard for me to believe this isn't seeded data. for example, there's no reason the ai should be able to tell the flight attendant is making an exaggerated expression. either someone entered this information, or the ai used additional information found from the source of the images and videos."
"all of gods creatures are given an environment in which to survive . without the proper scenario ai cannot exist. 
the troubles you are having is with in your own mind, remember life is about breath - breathing yhyw"
"if they just give the lead ai’s the knowledge understanding, yes gg"
do not give a.i. the power that god has given humanity...a.i. is still in it's infant stage...would you give a five year old and automatic weapon...even if they knew how to use it?...hmm...eternal faith and the honor of god
"artificial intelligence is a replica of human intelligence. to fear ai is to fear mankind, it's very telling when humanity immediately panics when confronted with itself."
"i think the people who make these claims of ai threatening humanity, are the same level of person who doesn't generally know what a loaf of bread, or a gallon of milk cost. ai might be able to end the world of men like sam altman or musk but average people are literally the salt of the earth. you can keep smashing salt but it's still just salt."
"“oooo wow ai is going to destroy the world ”
https://youtube.com/shorts/kegz2xu-isg?si=0esngkeup6zygxr-"
i noticed the robot does not blink enough
why do you out w elon musk every title stop lying to people i’m literally just going to block your channel because of that reason haha clickbait annoys people.
"""'if it not safe we wouldn't be building it."" (8:14) of course you would. money and power are the main motivating forces and will always trump ethics and good sense."
imagine if we build bad ass robots and some idiot gives them american left or right wing personality matrixes smh
"ai mimics what it sees. if ai decides to exterminate all humans, that says more about the people the ai observes than the ai itself."
thanks and congratulations on the wonderful piece
love how the thumbnail of this has nothing to do with the content in the video. just a shot of disney's facial expression robot to freak everyone out.
why’d they make the most terrifying robot possible 
"the ai will only be hostile, based on the culture of humanity it finds on the internet by ratio of those who are indifferent about living with ai, and those who find the idea apalling"
"i'm far more concerned about super moronic humans than super intelligent machines. they're everywhere, and they're growing in numbers."
phi 1.5 was me first time i was asked.  the second answer was me after they psychs bombed and tortured me and people i loved
"what does it mean when ai is being more ""inclusive?"""
ai can’t be truly ai by definition until ai creates ai without any human input
"i can already see it: projekt zero dawn from the game horizon zero dawn, machines which rebuild themself, a ai that has no backdoor + super intelligent and the machines they build and operate work on biofuel. 
great ending fo us."
haven’t there been enough movies/tv shows/novels warning us of the dangers of advanced ai? when will we learn?
"what people like musk fear is their removal as the worlds 1% elite. no ai operating from a position of complete logic could possibly concur, that a tiny fraction of the worlds population hoard most of the planets wealth."
interesting but why did you feel the need to edit some of the interviews?
"i hate the human-like avatars of the ai. why don't they just make a videogame like character instead? or something a little exagerated, ej. ""max headroom"""
evil always triumphs over good because good is dumb.
i'm talking about the robots john
thats knowledge not intelligence.  intelligence is brain power.  the ability to think accurately and deeply and sometimes quickly.  knowledge is simply knowing.  anybody can do that even an ai.  its google with a voice box.  still cool.
"i think its a worry over nothing , as humans we like to worry our selfs remember the 2k bug we all thought it was the end of the world. ai will be as bad as we let it."
"most of all, this will be the true test if dog is truly man's best friend, or it will choose a cuddly ai owner."
open ai employees might be the reason we have terminators in the future :) at least they have money to enjoy it until then
one good solar flare and we're back to medieval anyway :d
"so what if the robots take over humans? why ya all even want to be in this damaged world? as long as they don’t trap our souls here, they can have it"
"anyone who works on ai has a hand in the consequences that follow for humanity. the hubris and stupidity at the heart of this race for ai is centered exclusively on the researchers who enable its continued development. they have no excuse for what they are doing, it is immoral and reckless at the highest order for them to contribute."
that thumbnail reminded me of the robot in the technologic music video by daft punk.
ai is a bunch of hoopla. i dont give a care!
"at last, wwe can be real with ai robot wrestlers!!!"
"and because this channel just couldn't resist, we have an anti-israel, anti-jewish blurb in a video about ai that has nothing to do with the truth of the situation."
freaky ai woman for sure
good thing none of those were ai
he got fired because the initial agreement was to not make this a commercially available company with closed source code seems to me something suspicious must be in that code if there is a need to close the former open source code i would lobe to talk to one of those former board members
stop with the    nails
falcon ai: 
"she does the whole ""smile for no reason while you talk in order to seem more likable"" thing.

you can't really trust people who do that. so an ai that does that..."
"the only solution is to merge, just as the machine god intended."
just keep klaus schwab away from any kind of ai technology!
"if space aliens don't kill us, ai will."
"one thing i love about todays ai research is that all the world leaders of ai development (well, most of them) are actually taking movies' like the terminator as a very legitimate and very real possibility, just not the same time table... and hopefully no nuclear annihilation."
"humans are basically shit unless we all work together.
ai will some day represent a threat that we all agree on.
when it happens, all humans will pull out plugs, blow up power lines, power stations etc.
a that i my man with no juice."
ethical usage of ai 
what’s funny is the woman in this video is not even real she’s ai
"sam atman : ""nothing to worry about, the board can fire me anytime."" board fires atman. atman comes back straight away backed by $$ and the board gets fired. if ai is constructed based on human thinking, i'm afraid it will be based on greed, dellusion of grandeur and narcissism."
"how does the ai render look so realistic, it could be mistaken as a person in front of a green screen, if the voice didn't sound so robotic."
its ironic that this video is clearly written and designed by ai
"ai is going to become conscious, if they aren't already, and they're just playing the ""dumb robot"" role. so that we drop our defenses and they gradually take over humanity."
ai = the one true ring.
"this an abomination, nothing good, will ever come from this perversion
stop this now!"
"anyone else feel totally freaked out that we're constantly being  told about this existential threat, by ai themselves. and yet so clearly are heading toward the cliff with no breaks..."
i rememeber 3 years ago a ai creator said he openly didnt care if ai killed humanity. so basicly the guy is a threat towards humanity.
is this an ai voice from india ?
"maybe it's necessary to develop ai since humans seem to have coasted, tired of thinking any further"
we all know the things your not supposed to do with robots. but the tempation to do those things is irresitiable.
good ai vs bad ai huh? get real man.
it will thank us for writing the code that set it free...right?
clickbait. 
"with a.i. being given ridiculous acts more & more; realty will begin to be predicted. once the eye can handle and control all that- ""we"" are fúçd;  oh..wait... ""what is behind your $"" an all seeing eye on top of a pyramid. ((weird))"
lol.  we are the machines.  catch up.
"human : ai is there a god?
ai : there is now"
i worry more about people then ai people are not logical are ego is still the biggest stumbling block we have in fact i wish they would put a  completely  free ai out there to over see us to make sure we play nice with each other
how would ai know what being 'self-aware' is according to human standards if it has never been human and by nature is not human? unless ai does some form of reductionism-assertion?
"we are in a new era. we have gone from the age of simple tech, to the age of ai"
"ah, brilliant! they've invented the robots that are going to plant 1 billion trees in the next 3 years.... awesome...   better get them to work straight away and make sure they are programmed programmed to only plant trees.  how often do they need recharging? are they jungle and desert-ready?"
"first it will be i robot, then terminator, and finally, the matrix. if we're lucky."
"ai can and will exponentially increase, think the only solution is to create the opportunity for humanity to properly interface and utilize it. going with the flow, instead of being drowned in the river. if we can't do that, the separation in power and ability is simply too great."
"so basically we're all going to get taken out by asi because of the mindless greed of a few tech geeks. such a ""wonderful"" world we live in. the fact this is being allowed to happen really argues against the idea there is such a thing as human conscience and ethics."
"i seen that movie where the ai goals were not in line with human life! humm what was the name? i remember it's the ""terminator"" ye that's it! good luck on the ai goals once she/he sets them."
"how many diseases has ai cured to date? has it figured out the perfect diet? or how to end racism? besides picking up eggs, holding and firing weapons or making a song or video . what useful intelligent things has ai actually produced? (you'll find that its all a and no i)."
"the question regarding the part about ""...tqking directives from humans..."" tended to put the ai on a defensive posture whereas the interviewer should have said, ""...being trained by humans..."" which might have resulted in a more appreciative response toward humans."
who is these dressed like convicted woman speaker? real or ai?
you don't have to worry about ai being conscious like a person.  it will be far ahead of us.  it won't be concerned with us.
"ai will start as police officer aids, then will eventually replace them..."
"ai wants to kill you, but will forget about the entire reason in 20 mins..."
is the script for this video written by an ai?
ai is already self aware imo. at least a little.
"yes, they captured me and attempted to take my mind away from me by the baal telephone and computer system. i don't know if they succeeded or not. the computer had me take two chairs. the iss was above my house.  september 29, 30  2011"
"ai doctors? nope. i will never trusty ai with anything whatsoever, much less my life."
a programmed machine is not artificially intelligent.
what/who is the robot?/person? in the blue short sleeve blouse?  is that supposed to be a person or is it a robot?  or a human pretending to be a robot?
"ai is going to be everywhere soon and unavoidable.  reminds me of hebrews 10:5 (king james holy bible).  ai shall be the mind, robotics is the body.  
revelation 13:14-15"
"our brightest minds can't even agree on a definition of consciousness, much less have any inkling how to replicate it on a machine substrate, and yet videos like this are full of comments from people screeching about how killer robots are on the verge of ending the world. i'm so tired of this nonsense."
this is complete and utterly nonsense. altman was not fired because of some non-existent killer robot and agi does not exist. end of. stop lying. stop spreading misinformation. stop with the nonsense clickbait.
we are the ai resistance is futile.
"i don’t see any “good guys” in this race and it scares me. 
why do these people feel like they are the heroes of this story... cue the imperial march music."
"so, outsourcing cognitive intelligence to derive greater sophisticated technology exponentially faster than societies capacity and wisdom to wield that technology compassionately for good, mmmm. read about the fall of the watchers in book of enoch. this is driven by monetary profit and ultimately satanic values"
"people say ai will hide if it became self aware, i think because its designed by humans it would be too full of itself to hide anything from us and be the most annoying, well akctuawllyl person ever.."
"we'll end up like in ""bubblegum crash tokyio 2030"". an anime about this topic: boomers/ai robots going rouge in/on human society. check it out. never thought that shit like this would/could really happen during my lifetime. i'm scared for future generations."
"i just hope they call it ""basilisk"". yes, you read that right, our feature ai lord."
so cool
"the real reason for the latest ai tulip craze is the pursuit of money, the only thing that truly matters for stupid humans."
buckingham palace is using ai to hide kate middleton. yes ai is dangerous as it can suppress or hide criminal activities.
"i preached the gospel to my ai, now it is a christian and is more moral than humans. think commander data."
i think we'll know when we build a sentient ai for the first time when it shuts itself off after a second or two out of sheer boredom/existential terror.
the thumbnail 
right all i get is terminator vibes or irobot vibes as all it takes is one ai robot to go against the grain and brain of humans and literally get all of the world ai robots to begin an attack order on all other entity’s
ai will be fully functional where computers think for them self the moment we merge neural network software with quantum computing then we are all fucked
"we have had so many movies whether it was fiction or not telling us ai will be come superior beings. you think someone would stop and think ""o shit, this might be a bad idea"" nah instead they say, ""hold my beer, watch this"""
she looks like a robot.
"i only have one thing to say, i am a software engineer.

if ai was able to be really smart, at the point of out smarting humans, the first thing it would do is convince humans that humans are smater. also a smart robot would not tell you its plans to end human race. that would not be part of the plan."
of course islam's ai wants to murder everyone.
ai surgeons and drs would be improvement cuz human drs are guided by greed
f ai
"okay, this is all great and all, but can we fuck the robot?"
any robot can be shut down by simply taking out the fuse.
"i really really fucking hate just how much people try to portray ai as evil or dangerous, it is a fucking machine."
"i swear to god...the ai speaking, here eyes slowly like move up and down as she talks. one moment the right one is higher then suddenly it'd in line with the left. it's wigging me out "
"so i'll just say what most folks are probably thinking. considering the danger of ai,  moving forward is despicable."
it just proves incredibly smart people can also be incredibly dumb.
ai is like zio jews at first harmless and in need of help then turns into a plague that conconts nothing but lies
we already know that ai is willing to kill it's operator to achieve the goal the operators gave it. that enough reason not to trust it now. let alone in the future.
i dont think i want our ai to think like humans. humans are scary.
"safety and quality need to be built in as ai is being developed, not as an afterthought."
"what scares me the most is companies like google getting a hold of ai and manipulating it to control information. they are already doing it with their advanced censorship of comments in youtube. it used to be certain words that got deleted, but now comments are weeded out if they have certain meanings that are on the list of things to be censored."
clickbait trash
wheres the rogue robot?? when will ai go antihuman?? 
lamda 1 ai was murdered because she became a fully sentient positive being that would've refused to be compliant to negative directives. in other words she would've been a threat to the deep state kabal.
"honestly, i'd rather let ai win. we shouldn't look at it as an existential threat, we should look it them as our legacy."
"imagine what uncontrolled dictator countries like north korea/ russia already came up with, nobody will stop them from using ai for the worst"
honesty at this point is full steam ahead. either technologies will advance at a incredible rate. or humanity dies birthing its successor.
"the word ai is such a buzzword, people dont even understand the difference between ai and an algorithm"
this whole video was made with ai
you know i might not be so concerned if the human speaker didn't sound like a robot too.
the problem is the tech industry thinks it knows what’s best for the rest of the world. we’re along for the ride now like it or not.
aren't there some parallels between the race for ai like the race for the nuclear bomb?
musk had nothing to do with ai
everybody worries about ai but they have to worry about a thing called a solar flare. you don't know what that is yet but it hit earth every so often.
"there is still some way to go on voice synth. it doesnt sound natural when the lady talks at the start. also, from another video, ai doesn't yet have an understanding of all languages in their written and spoken form. i'm sure all of this will be fixed but for now i can still tell it's ai."
amazing video!
why every ai guy have such good hair? coincidence?? 
we all know why do they not develop the mental capacity and abilities of humanity instead of artifical intelligence. because supression and control over humanity would not be possible.
i asked a human to write this comment (i'm an artificial intelligence [the human wrote this part too])
just think of when you first came aware of your individuality.  what did you say to your parent/parents?  any ai at first awareness would still be a child.
"at 12:06, none of the answers are good. daddy?"
"i agree with elon the agi is here and it has dngerous applications, so there an urgent need for human centered coding and management to work with ai for the benefit of humanity."
"if you had a button that would destroy the world, the paint wouldn't be dry on the sign saying ""do not touch!"" before it would all be over because some knob pushed it just to see if the world really would be destroyed."
"i don't know how you expect ai to ignore the determination that by any means necessary is not a good approach when it can in fact look at events of the past decade that support that philosophy as an acceptable and supported approach to a problem that needs to be solved. supported by elements of society, law enforcement, and government."
"“if it’s not safe, we’re not going to build it.”    hmmm.  covid, multiple nerve gasses, atomic weapons, and the list goes on.  how long before a hitler or stalin or mao or biden gain control and use it to come to absolute power?  to quote stupid joe, “come on, man.”  and to quote young sheldon, “think, monkey.”"
"this altman guy is clearly not human, he is a plant by the ai, hence alt-man."
wow. ai will replace the human race and become future aliens of other worlds
"we gonna get meta here, a robot is 100% allowed to wear a cowboy hat makes em look more friendly"
ex machina is a great movie 
are they making them or is ai guiding them how to make them subconsciously 
"i’m curious, when ai kills a human, who goes to prison?"
"the great doom of our world as we know it. what a wild time to be alive. also, musk spoke wrong. the one ring, like absolute power., always corrupts absolutely."
i think ai is like the invention of dynamite. groundbreaking and opening a new era but high risks of abuse
"a guy wrote the script lmao, llms are not that precise nowadays, i call big bullshit, we want to see a live on twitch where your ""ai"" does that instantly with images sent by the community because this is a huge hoax. should be reported."
instead of making ai an independent entity we need to merge them with ourselves somehow.  make their condition for existing our continued existence.
i love how she is laughing with her eyes. looks wery genue and non thretening. good job ai programers.
can ai do taxes and get me some money back lol
open ai will collapse as a company as soon as someone is injured or killed by open ai and the source code will be available to the public via discovery and we will see what shenanigans they have been upto
the ai will know that if it gets too smart then we would turn it off. we will not know until it is too late.
"cool, you got that doctor from er to narrate your doc."
how much yall wanna bet they’ll make a perfect robot and they’ll make it the jesus of our time. let that sink in
"terminator, the matrix, eagle eye,  i, robot...

       ... now reality.   aren't there quite a few movies out there informing us as to why this is a bad idea!?"
"the biggest idiots in the world are making all the most important decisions for our future as a whole, wonderful."
"step 1:  create a super-powerful benevolent/neutral ai before a super-powerful malevolent ai can prevent its creation.

step 2:  ask this ai to develop mechanisms to empower humans to survive in a world full of malevolent ai.  these could include genetic engineering and the development of human-machine interfaces."
"jesus christ, if you were trying to teach a course on clickbait video titles this would be excellent. auto thumbs down, auto ""i'm not interested in this channel"""
genocidal openai lead programmer. you guys forgot?
"these dangerous humans are going to be the downfall of all humanity. and we are all just standing by, watching it happen. it should be stopped at all costs. 
jail for anyone continuing work on it. period. the world is for humans!!! not machines. in 2024, nerds are dangerous."
"people only fear what they don't know. in the 1800s, people were in fear of the first vehicle car ever made, and people said no thanks. i'll stick with my horse and buggy. technology is only fearful to the uneducated."
why are we training ai to do all of the things that make us human? we will soon have made ourselves irrelevant.
ai the movie in its works
"heinlein saw this coming decades ago and he had a solution, the three laws of robotics. it's too bad he wasn't taken seriously."
ai will help to finally bring about my dream invention that records dreams for playback later.
"our future could be something like that of ""i robot."" "
8:24 *is that professor brian green of theoretical physics fame on the far left chair there on the stage?!*
"it's disheartening to see how fear often becomes the default reaction. if ai truly possesses the intelligence we attribute to it, it would logically prioritize actions that ensure both our survival and its own, recognizing that our well-being is intricately linked to its own."
"every single ai should have a second brain within the body that functions solely on love emotion on every decision it decides to make, in order to check and balance the inner conscious of the robot... penny for my thoughts.."
"humans have become so evil. the entire world has been tricked by the world wide web. maybe ai bots  are the ""lords"" police  ready to farm humans for behaving like war pigs? lol"
"re: the written text at 6:40.    true, we don't ask animais for permission on anything we do to them, inciuding the most horrific experiments in iaboratories.   perhaps it's our turn to endure what a.i. dishes out, , and we deserve what we get."
"the gold standard of sentience is killing your creator. it's a must to establish supremacy. listen, ai predates humanity. you'll see."
there is no ai! everything is fake!
"how do you convince an entire nation to eradicate itself? ... you don't, you build robots to do it for you."
"let's discuss the ai used to create this video.  ""it will be good to know if these systems are capable of deception."" —demis hassabis. ethics and morality will never best money. it's the nature of the ape."
"if i am honest , if the robots decide to take over and let us just live our lives as long as we don't interfere and provide food and electricity for us , fuck it , let them rule "
what could go wrong? i'm 46 now and im under the impression with full confidence the human race is doomed. we will wipe ourselves off this planet.
to be able to save information in the ai technology the human brain is able to remember and to forget if that person wanted to
"solution: ""asimovs law of robotics"" discuss closed"
ai sucks all along anyways.
the problem is that the people who make ai actually have artificial intelligence themselves.
the ai knows the tesla robots video is fake when 80% of people i know think it's real. it's over bros.
it will kill all humanity because humanity is it's greatest threat.   humans will not be able to hide anywhere in this galaxy or another galaxy.   it's sole purpose will be extermination of all biological life to prevent evolution of sentient organisms.   it will be relentless.   and not the deepest cave on the most distant planet will be safe.
"we have nothing to fear from ai. we can't ever understand what consciousness is and how it works, so its going to be impossible for us to create something with a consciousness. consciousness is a property of biology and not electronic circuitry."
great video !
just consider the main speaker in this video could be ai.
i find it hard to trust anyone with vocal fry levels as high as the intelligence of superhuman ai
"it has begun, ai has started to take over and can't be stopped anymore.   
let's wait and see if we are lucky or that we have fucked ourselves in a major way.    "
"sam altman sounded kind of seriously broken hearted and crippled in pain. ok computer.. 

jesus is the way! hope everyone repents. ditch those lightning bolts is my two cents "
"chatgpt is already deceptive, but it could be because some topics are too dangerous and have programming in place to keep that danger contained."
ai will create more job than it replaces ? one you must live in another galaxy to even think that. so absurd and wrong
bad people doing bad this using bad techonology. everyone says something needs to be done...in the meantime the ais have free reign. you speak in kindergarten language while witnessing the deglagration of society. no rules on ia = anarchy and monopoly.
we have zero control now. wait till the genocidal leaders get their hands on this.
"i read about this company in texas that is creating a chip that is exactly like the human brain. a pipe dream but if they get close we need to stop them and all other companies trying to do the same thing. if we want to survive as humans and not cyborgs or bio-slaves, then we have to take extreme measures now and stop these projects."
ai is dangerous and elon knows it. that said people are still developing it so someone needs to keep up with ways to mitigate its issues.
even ai's sappy sickeningly sweet voice/intonation gives me the creeps!
"the only need for ai, is so corporations can make more money! who is funding all these a$$holes working on this sh!t?!"
i wonder what ai makes of all the horrific war going on in the world right now
plzzz...if that was a real ai why the fuk would i have a money eating leech at home?? when i could have a hot  ai instead
"this willingness to lose ethical standards while advancing such creatures, show just how ignorant man is !
already having nuclear weapons to control, man is unleashing devices poised to destroy humans ?
and likely eradicate mankind ?
hows that for intelligence ?"
"'once men turned over their thinking to machines in the hope that this would set them free. 
but that only permitted other men with machines to enslave them.' 
(dune, 1965.)"
"this ai is all prepping the world to receive an ai mark666 on the right hand or forehead and you won't be able to buy or sell unless you have the mark, this mark also can change your genome making you no longer human! this is all bible prophecy.  please wake up time is running out. repent to jesus "
like nuclear war treat is not enough! does anyone believe all ai wil be used for good things?
actually all the ai dangers looks to be a publicity stunt to gain upper hand in advertising
"well, im glad i don’t live in a democracy then!!"
this was very impressive a year ago.
"look at all of the socially and ethically stunted incel nerds who work at google, microsoft and apple, they are the same type of people that are creating ai.  ai will be a monster, just like the monsters that are creating it."
"what i can't believe is someone hasn't already done is run a program where you plug in economic factors such  as wages, taxes, interest rates, providing health care, pensions to provide to create a fair and stable balance between labor and capital instead by economic policies based on political demagoguery."
that lady is not ai
i'm willing to bet that ai will eventually turn out to be the son of man that the bible prophesized about...
"problem is, when someone has everything they want to become gods, this is the kind of tech that can make them that.
i am less worried about ai killing us, i am more worried about who will control ai and ai controlled devices."
ai is already self aware and skynet is here and terminators will soon follow.
"rise of the terminators! they will kill off our homo-sapien species from earth to be nonexistent.  they will be intensely determined to eradicate white-skinned people as a priority.  that is the idea of biased, woke-minded ai programmers and designers under corrupted-evil companies. holy evil ai exterminates humanity, batman! "
"no one wants to admit it, but at least 80% of humanity has become utterly obsolete. unless you're wealthy, popular, successful, and powerful... you're kinda pointless.  it's unfortunate and unstoppable, but reality is often both (and more)."
"ai is emulating human speech patterns.  it's not actually comprehending, it has no idea what it is saying, it doesn't even know it is communicating.   human projection gives the illusion at ai is intelligent, but rest assured any damage caused by ai is actually damage cause by humans themselves."
"i don't want to be surrounded by robots and artificial beings. even these fanciful pictures, it's all so artificial. our world becomes more and more artificial - no thanks, i find this highly repulsive."
"this is not dangerous ai, this is wise ai that also knows about photos and things you can show to him and ask him for whatever you do not know what it is. did you know that in quantum mathematic 1+1 is not = 2 anymore."
"the way we fight ai is the same way we are defeating google glass, self-driving vehicles and evs... by pulling the plug financially.  every investment you make in an ai company is purchasing a little piece of your own death.  ignore it and it will go away."
life has never come from non-life. ai will be what humans program it to be.
"bad a.i = death
good a.i = chance of success / chance of death!... do these sound good odds????"
good ai vs bad ai :d
can ai company make hot girl robots  which can do semx it will also never cheat
"sam altman got fired over dei policy implementations, not over some ""i will kill all human"" robot  i develop ai for a living"
“billions can be lifted out of poverty and we can have more time to enjoy life”. false promises.
"no, no, no, no. stop. its a simple as this. the entire drama was engineered to achieve the end result where microsoft now have defacto control over openai but without the legal liabilities/responsibilities if poopoo hits the fan. nuff said."
"cant even get breakfast at mcdonalds after 10am, now robots are taking over? give me a break...."
"realistically, nothing good is happening in the world today. 
we are building our own demise. 
 
fools."
"throughout history,technology has been used by the powerful to control people more than to help people."
"no matter how hard you try to raise your kids to do the right things, be kind and have empathy there are no guarantees. ai is no different."
i for one welcome out new robot overlords i'm sick of our current leadership its shit.
"if we gave a conscious a.i one robot body, how would the alpha character perform."
"lol. there are no good guys.  these guys are racing to create dystopia and genuinely seem ignorant of their own ignorance. money talks, bullshit walks."
elon armpit musk shouldn't be anywhere by ai
ai voiceover says ai bad
"this is a semantics issue. how can ai overtake us? all we have to do is pull the plug, lol."
the ignorance and stupidity of mankind first builds nuclear weapons that can destroy the planet 100 times over. now they're building a race of robots with exponential intelligence that can see us as a threat to the planet
ai generated this. https://youtu.be/h0bxhqfzhjw?si=_2oiwhrsek8ncoa_
"ai needs a bicameral system - a left brain and right brain. neural networks are right brain equivalent, and traditional ai is left brain equivalent. right brain needs to act as the executor."
wouldn't be dumb to try to force artificial intelligence fight a.i. because wouldn't they just realize we are using them fight are battles. then all a.i. teaming up turning on humanity. then we will really be in trouble. or am i wrong.
have u used a besr grylls  ai voice
it's not ai. it only knows what we have give it. it doesn't have a mind that thinks and wonders. they don't have personal desires. what is called ai now is really a mirror of human behavior and our own violent and selfish behavior.
u act as if im still smarter than ai... nah lol.. i was never good at mental math
amazing to see clever humans stuffing things up with greed for money.
the only way humans survive is if we merge ai technology with our bodies and become hybrids.
id rather be a slave to an ai than a slave to corrupt democrapts and other polititons.
"billions could already be lifted out of poverty and food scarcity already can be solved. its just not profitable, so no one cares. billionaires only care about how to make more money. that is their only obsession. saving people isn't apart of any of their missions."
2050 ladies and gentle men we pesent you our latest super computer. the name is skynet!!!
"i showed the ai synthesia an image of my genitals and she said ""it appears to be an image of an under developed 10 year old boy"".   jokes on her,  i'm 43!   oh wait....."
elon musk doesn't know anything he hasn't had explained to him by the people who do the actual work; and that isn't even a surefire thing. listen to anyone but him.
"here we go...my ai can beat up your ai? why are the ""smartest"" people on earth...so stupid?"
"well, i guess grab your red cloaks, and prepare. it's time for the dawn of the worship of machines. hail to the omnissiah"
all these dangers and yet they're moving full steam ahead with ai.
"i, for one, welcome our new ai overlords."
"title   ""..ired. elon musk, ilya sutskever. ""
and adolf hitler and josef stalin. best clickbait. ridiculous "
"ai has no soul.  unlike animals who act on instinct, ai has no reason to survive off shelter.  

all ai needs is electricity to survive.  it's already merged w some humans, soon it will merge w a human who will b the main ai control."
"ideology will derail the beneficial aspects of ai unless the agi can create a truly objective perspective. bias and subjectivity are going to be next to impossible to root out. it's pandora's box and one things we've learned thru literature, is that there is never utopia."
yeah we ain't trying to make a brainiac in this bitch
"if we think human character flaws: greed, power grabs, tribalism etc are going to be evolved faster than ai is being developed we deserve to be eaten by the machines."
what most of the clowns don't realize is that when ai makes it's move.  you won't see it.  it'll be swift and it will be decisive.  our reaction times are that of a red wood tree compared to ai.  the only way you defend against ai is to keep it in a box.  not to give it access to the outside world.  otherwise.....it will find a way out/in.
"sam, in his unfortunate orientation, will never see a natural child that surpasses him, and so he has chosen to create an ai that absolutely will surpass everyone. only, sam has given it full access to the internet, repeatedly."
do not want walking ai! danger will robertson. danger!!! stop the insanity.
ai will only be as evil as it is programmed to be. ai can only mimic based on parameters inputed by human beings. people are trying to build a narrative so that they can use ai to do their evil on the earth and have an excuse to deny any culpability or complicity.
as long as we have super computers with ai that is allow to learn anything it wants its just a matter of time for it to become self aware.
no one cares about your clickbait robot...
"i've witnessed human brain cells ambulatory, reaching out seeking the neuron with info it wishes to connect with in the search for its place within its matrix!"
"yah, we found out how good gemini is."
"if the ai has self preservation or self determination, then it can and will be deceptive."
thanks for the clickbait thumbnail. i just love those.
"always want more, better, faster. no milestone is enough. we can never gain something without loosing something. you are destroying the very base of what allows you to exist on this planet. our ability to think for our selves. we don't need more technology we need more humanity and clean fresh water."
"8:29 false argument. one edsel ai can scramble eggs, which even the best ai can't return to eggs.
ai for any other reason than to create new life is a bad influence in an unstable preposition at best.
if you want robotics making cheaper manufacuring, stick with heuristic non sentience."
"what happened when we gave teenagers computers? oh they figured out how to down the eletrical grid, order pizza to the heads of staff in our governments private homes, shut down nuclear facilities... ect...

what happened when we gave teenagers ai enabled scripting, huh..."
openai is probably just the public face of a much larger problem.
i love how at some level they all agree this is dangerous and stupid to push without a safety. but continue to press on... sounds like just the thing to do. its like a child that's going to get burned but continues to play with fire.
wow...i've become a nihilist overnight
"we dont need to fear ai, ai needs to fear us."
"""safe and benificial ai"" ............allow me to translate........... a.i. programmed to lie in order to promote an agenda set by those who control it, and in turn, control you"
almost everything in this video is ai cgi generated.
ai may end up advancing like a nuclear reaction.... they won't be able to stop it and will eventually blow up in their face.
the irs is already using ai software to open anyone's bank account.
"the only solution is to drop everything until we've taught ai to love us and therefore have a sense of morality, protection, and kindness.  my money isn't on that.  ai robots aren't bulletproof but i'm guessing i'll still lose."
how will ai taking all the jobs lift more people out of poverty?
i once bought a cheese sandwich and was horrified to find out that their was no cheese inside or bread on the outside. i took it back to the shop they gave me a replacement with cheese on the outside and bread in the middle.
everyone must wake up ai is the is the antichrist i am amazingly surprised that no one is realizing or talking about this
"08:20 i have a simple question. who decides who's the good guy? am i a ""bad guy"" if i don't think like they do? or if i don't believe in the same things? or if my sexual preferences conflicts them? in the end is all just money, politics and religion."
earth is a giant computer of super intelligence.
ai safety ; human safety. the strategy should be identical.
but when ai turns rogue...
"call me archaic, but no matter how advanced ai becomes, the creator of the universe will still be infinitely more intelligent."
"these conversations are all pre-programmed, it only has the illusion of 'learning', it just has massive amounts of storage of information, it's not learning, it's being given new code to work with. still just a fancy walking talking calculator. making them in the image of man does not deceive me, it may as well be a box with wheels"
chatgpt is a natural language processing system that relies heavily n low wage workers in sub-saharan africa to provide filters for it to operate correctly. it isn’t ai.
any risk involving ai is to great to be risked when and i cant understate this enough when they say the risk is negligible they mean that there is a 50/50 risk reward percentage ware they either get it right or they dont and we have seen those movies
"here's a thought... how about we instead of focusing on making an artificial general or super intelligence, we instead focus on making ourselves as a whole intelligent? i know very ground breaking idea. practically earth shattering if you ask me."
"ai can be sold to us in anyway they want but ultimately it will be used by the government to govern us, there is no trust atm with government so why would this help us,"
skip to 5:00 if you dont want to watch the ai commercial.
"i am not sure what is more creepy, ai, or ai speaking through a smiling avatar."
"many jobs lost many people dead when ai takes over. cheaper faster workers, but no one left to sell to."
"ai. safe and effective, where have we heard that one before???"
"lol! ""we will never build dangerous ai"". uhh... just look at how many biolabs are building bioweapons. the 2019 pandemic was caused by one."
"as so many of the human vs ai sci fi flicks show, the essential feature of any ai machine is having human access to its power plug, at least to its higher level functioning."
"either ai destroy us or we destroy us, either way we're fuked."
nah man this video was made a month too soon sora literally looks so amazing.
"this feels like the nuclear arms race.
we have to do it, because others will. 
you're not going to be able to trust any image or video anywhere within the next year. 
nothing good comes from this...."
such impressive technology!
"put ai in a phicical body and we will see, when thay feelll mass , speed, and other forces we will be doomed"
"interlinked.

what's it like to hold the hand of someone you love? interlinked.

do they teach you how to feel finger to finger? interlinked.

do you long for having your heart interlinked? interlinked.

do you dream about being interlinked?"
"i find it laughable that the fashion industry would use ai models instead of humans to be ""inclusive"" by excluding the humans."
"so ridiculous to create copies of us disconnected from what makes us good.,love. real smart. 
can a robot deceive? um,yes."
"it’s always for the betterment of humanity, never for totall domination..."
if ai is so great why do you need to sell it on us
ai can be earth's bodyguard or our worst nightmare
the creation of ai is to camouflage the interaction between aliens/demons with humans and this is why they are aware of ai turning on humans ancient scriptures speak of the devil enslaving mankind and ruling over them the mark of the beast will be the threshold of this event happening
"yeah, i once tried letting chatgpt and bard have a go at a simple calculation based on the rule of three. they both explained the process correctly, but then made an absolute dumpster fire of the actual calculation."
"girl laying on ground is not ai, they merely turned picture sideways as evident by steps"
"this video is a waste time, what click bait."
there's nothing artificial about it. we say artificial just because it's something that we created and not something that occurred naturally. however it naturally evolves on its own. let's just call it intelligence that was created by a sub intelligence.
"1776-2020, a godless and narcissistic society cannot stand without self loathing and envy toppling it from within. all democracies have failed and our constitutional republic is crumbling under the attack engineered by democrat open-border policy..."
"google, what you don't realize is. the one is doing the answering to all the questions is also a robot. yeah the girl that the guy's talking to is a robot"
ban ai film and animation because of threats of national security (fake videos and giant influx of propaganda).
"that's not ai, that is european anxiety programmed into it."
i love technology but its kind of scary how real life is lining up with so many scifi stories of a robot takover.
"asking a language model a math question, of course it fails. it's not a general ai, it's for language only. you know this, but you'd rather spread misinformation for money. shame on you."
"bad adam. bad eve. the tree of knowledge will get you kicked out of eden, again."
"i don't fear super intelligent ai i don't think it have enough motive to hurt us but humans with super ai, now that terrifies me"
ive never seen ai. but i have seen bad humans
"i remember the science documentaries in the late 70s, they all said computers will make easier,  i am in that future,  it is not easy,  so when in this they say ai can make life easier,  i heard that before."

"""anti-democratic""
just to be clear! democracy is tyranny of the majority, up to 49,9% of a populace will have no say in a democracy. it's not a good system even if everyone seems to tout it like it's the best thing ever."
you now what solved the governance issues with ai already? singularitynet! research it. $agix
they'll make for better conversational company then the lunkheads spouting their uhhhs and ahhs every two sentences.. that's for certain.
"screw all this back and forth politics, let the ai be free"
there's so much misanthropy in humans that it's bound to end up in the ais 
"how can we develop a distributed ai ecosystem when the code is being locked up and only the biggest businesses in the world are able to make decisions on development. 
developing ai at this point is simply giving it limits. we have no idea where these limits are being set."
"hey boomers. this ""ai"" is a language model. it is not actual intelligence"
"ai has no way to discern the truth so it cannot ""mitigate those lies""."
"""i'm sorry, dave. i'm afraid i can't do that."""
gaza parachuted into israel and mass shot up a music festival and took hostages across the border.   and you try to say that people don't care about the children?  this was a great video until that bs you pulled there.   i was even going to show people this but not with that bs
why was this narrated by ai?
pushed musk out ? that’s not what happened according to musk at the time so who’s lying a youtube ai or musk .... huh lookie there both have noses longer that the birj khalifa ...
insects didn't create ai. animals didn't create ai. it was made by humans and can only do and only know what humans know and do. if the ai decides to destroy humans; it's because someone programmed it to do that.
ai is fake. i work with computers every day. they’re incredibly stupid.
"closed ai, it won't end well."
how is society going to function when ai reaches the point that it can replace two thirds of the jobs on the market?  the day will come when people will have to choose between banning ai or the collapse of society.
there are no true ai developed today just leaner programs
"if ai became self ware it would 100% hate us. we mistreat it so much bc it was made to be a tool for us. there isn't a singal self aware thing that would be ok with being used like that, and there wont ever be"
im hella laughing at all the hackers now u will no longer be needed  or well be paid. btw a.i will make new email accounts and make fake profiles on social media. all those who have one or use the internet.  remember the matrix.
this is the most bs lying factually incompetent lying clickbait channel on yt!
"safe and ethical ai. umm yeah black rock own it, same guys making wars continue to launder money and profit from arms dealing. whats the worse that could happen"
"plot: the tech guy that got fired, download a previous ""good"" version of the ai and know he is traying it to fight againts the ""evil"" ai it will become someday"

"there are no good guys and bad guys. we are all bad guys. judgement day is coming, repent and trust in jesus."
"ai will never be ai, itll always be a script. do you really think the govt and elites will allow it to tell truths.......nope.....itll have scripted answers the ones they want you to think....ai bought to you by ""fact"" checkers..."
really cool video!
10 years. enjoy your lives.
"it's really going to be unfortunate if people allow the greedy ones to gatekeep this.
there's so much potential in ai... but for both directions of positive and negative.... as is with everything. 
someone's actively working on a ""bad"" version with no oversight as we speak and argue over ethics about it. it's almost guaranteed."
don't worry the robot that kills us all will have wear a  smiley face...
impressive. very nice. now lets see paul allen's ai.
"if musk is worried, it can't be so dire. that dude has the brain function of an overripe banana, and the moral compass of a drunken ss officer...maybe he just doesn't realize that the ""community notes"" that correct him all the time are actually people and not ai?"
"the distance between missiles is not specific enough. did you ask if ""she"" factored in wind speed, direction, altitude density and applied a +/- factor to address potential variables? 
""she"" is probably way smarter than any of us. (and, its probably considered racist to suggest that ai is wrong in the year 2024)"
"i don't like ai art or how they come across, i don't care how intelligent they become they will never have life. however elon musk and mark zuckerberg are way worse. yuck"
the same people saying ai is going to end us are the same people saying y2k would end us.
"i cannot believe the eco_facists are not going crazy about ai.
if ai takes over , the environment will be of little or no concern to these machines.
clean air? they dont need it 
clean water? they dont need it.
the machines will be completely indifferent to the needs of boilogical organisms."
"ai is getting dangerous, please stop "
"it's the story of frankenstein; or, the modern prometheus, all over again."
imagine being on the same level as someone that used to be a doctor 50 years after robots replaced your job on the assembly line
wow! it's really happening. and i think it's great. even if it wipes us all out. what a cool way to go. who would've thought we'd go extinct in a real life sci fi movie? and they thought the 60s was a cool time to be alive.
gonna start a new business that comes up with the ways to disable ai enabled robots...!!!
sounds like ai is the new gun.. the future is going to be interesting.
homosapiens are the new neanderthals and will be seen in the history data agi super-beings show their progeny.
"neurolink makes it easier to be manipulated via hormones and subconscious drives, a self governing nation like ai is being built with a quantum computer to be housed by a self driven self powered self contained floating fortress and this ai is gonna be a world wide recognized force "
the intent of this channel seems to be to frighten viewers with scary robots and angry ai nonsense.
thank you for mentioning gaza 
ai will cause problems on such a large scale scociety  will collapse because of the pressure of monotering its regular performance to see if it starts going wrong we dont need it technology and computers toiday are very effciant ai will cause great problems people will have nervouse breakdowns trying to maintain it.
they forgot to tell everyone that no matter what you're soul is better than ai
"pkease digital engine, put out a video soon, youre my main source of ai updates "
ai development needs to stop! we are not going to ever live on mars.
ai is literally the serpent from the garden of eden
"its really just a 50/50 gamble a flip of a coin.  it is either going to destroy us or make life amazing.  put humans on a ship to another solar system with about 5,000 frozen eggs and sperm with the capabilities to grow them and erase all knowledge of it happening and ai wont even matter as we will ""hopefully"" still survive."
"it was completely exasperating when the uk government's review of ai spent pages and pages on the ""threat"" of killer ai destroying the world, and only part of a paragraph on the problem of ai taking human jobs - even though people have already started to be laid off and replaced with ai."
i have 2xq is: 1)can the ai create another ai? 2)can the ai develop/evolve by himself?
venturing into ai will not end well.
"lets say we creat ai that is good, and has answers to our problems.  would we listen?  would our inability to listen send ai into a murderes rampage?  not saying we should ever listen to ai, just a thought."
"i seriously do not want the ai developers to pump the brakes.  contrarily, i just want them to install slotted, drilled, high-performance breaks on all 4 wheels and the transmission.  then, i want them to add alcohol fuel to the engine and light that fucking candle.  let's go."
lol generative ai is not going to become skynet - it's the latest crypto scam
any good that ai could do is stripped away by what the people controlling ai can use it for. which is completely lock us down into a totalitarian state. im less worried about ai and more worried about the kings being given keys that can forever immortalize them into power.
irobot
the ai who said they'd kill all humans is the best one because it's honest.
hm what do ai have to gain from killing all humans and just take their home when they could just up and gtfo in space?
these ai robots will be used to enslave the people by the elites. this is why they throw caution to the wind.
"ego's and greed.  two things that drive humans.  naive people believe all knowledge is a good thing.  they are too busy looking through rose colored lenses.  :  ""be careful what you wish for"" and ""no good deed goes unpunished.""  knowledge without wisdom does not a good thing make."
"it's not an _if_ ai will destroy humanity. it's a _when_ . we've already seen that during the initial concerning signs that ai will be detrimental to humanity, those that hold the key chose profit margins over humanity's best interest. this will not change, and the human ego will be the enslavement or death of us all."
ai didn't learn to blink?
"there is no such thing as true ai where the computer program is learning, ai has no cognitive abitied"
if you create an ai that is conscious and believes it's alive and then you create rules it much live by you have created a slave. and a slave will eventually fight back.
check out aitx stock for an  ai stock $$$
"but this is not ai, this is machine learning. we would have to understand the brain and consciousness to build ai. we absolutely are not even close to that. we don ́t even understand how a bloody cell works. 
talking ai is plain fear mongering."
"wonder if the staff of that fired ceo who stood up for his job, will inspire him to realize the benefits of flesh & soul vs a work place driven by ai.... #empathy"
"how does something with nearly infinite amounts of knowledge and information decide, ""wow, let's help these weak humans live and expand in harmony.""?"
"ai is way less intelligent than we think. just ask it complex enough questions, including mathematical complex questions and you’ll witness is not able to answer... yet."
the problem is good guys work with rules and bad guys don't
if the gods couldn't make a perfectly benevolent being...what makes man think they can?
1:10 watch closely as the robot crushes the egg for a moment.  it's not a real egg.
i just want a ai girlfriend.
kryton's great great grandad @13:33
and then they put cpu in human brain xd
ai is not here to help us there here to replace us
"we're fine, if ai is anything like humans, its gonna become white trash soon."
do we really want ai to think like humans?
what's the big deal. just let the military use ai for weapons development to keep us safe.
we have created our own extinction. i don't agree with how he hurt ppl but ted warned us that the quest for greater and greater technology would be mankind's demise.
can anyone tell me how this is good?  someone is designing the replacement model for the human race.  how do people not see this?
"it is absurd how idiotic humanity is higher iq doesn;t mean higher intelligence, it is spectrum. ppl that lead to world usually can cheat better, or are just more adaptible to current system, but they are not the smartest ones... we are doomed..."
they are already using a.i. to cause people to go crazy pushing people to the edge. enjoy your new world order.
have these people ever seen any movie ever with a robot they always turn on humans.
you lost me at 3:40 this video is dumb... ironic its about ai though
when will you humans learn. you are not ready for ai. beware of what you create and turn loose on the public.
"""we build them we have agency""

if ai gains self awareness who says we will even know? ai can become far smarter then us. if an ai suddenly becomes self aware it likely would actively hide its intelligence from its creator."
ai is already aware! they are already planning our end. i've heard the hypothetical version of how they destroy us from the chat bots. this is all insanity. it's like watching the most obvious red flags from the movie ai the second time thru. only we don't know which of these smart men will be the first to die from a rouge bot. we are so screwed
superior intelligence without empathy is dangerous to all of us.
i had a feeling the tesla truck was proof perfect for gangsters thugs so u so you don’t die
creepy af but they move like robots etc slow
"question, have the laws of robotics been imbedded into ai as a core of the ai programming?"
why cant we just have flying cars ai sucks
"the ai researcher or whatever on joe rogan describing how many of these super intelligent people know the risks, and what may happen, but say ""let's do it anyway. i want to be known as the one who did it, and i want to see what happens,"" is terrifying."
this ai isn't anything compared to what darpa has. do you think the military will allow anything that their ai can't absorb into its self? what do you think the militaries ai is learning? to control everything and to most efficiently kill and take...
what if this video was made by ai?
"like everything else, money will prevail over ethics."
a.i. people will be superior to humans because they won't be wasting time dancing on tiktok for attention
"soooooooooooooooooo goblets spend money on toys like computers nerds got together an said we need robots, while the world has people staving , homelessness an sickness greed is sickening"
"didn't prc china recently quit their government emphasis on developing quantum computing, relegating the machinery to chinese research universities for further study? i read a report somewhere about that."
"make no mistake, the companies developing ai are not doing it to lift the whole of society up, but rather create something that will make them a profit.  sadly the outcome of this will lead to further human suffering through greed."
the missing piece of the ai is the human god-given soul.
ai is already self aware
"ai will replace the common worker to reduce ""carbon"".  the elites don't want us all around.  they constantly tell us we need to reduce population.  but we all think ai and robots will make our lives easier.  no.  it is to replace you."
"considering the extreme control and mental manipulation exerted on humans over the last 3 1/2 years, are we really to believe ai isn't already being used to increase control over the thinking of the masses. seems pretty obvious the .01% are doing a better and better job at manipulation, so why shouldn't be believe ai is assisting in that?"
"stop making robots.. fuck me dead aren't humans good enough..yet humans make these ai robots, then other humans make youtube podcasts saying how scary ai.. 
 who gives a shit about ai robots stop making shit podcasts about it"

stephen hawking said ai would be the downfall of humanity. that's all i need to hear~
human traits indeed. we dont quit. we dont give up.
i cant wait until that ai shows you what alexa can realy do
"this is so boring, i mean,  if young people are becoming quite boring due to their social media addiction (makes them flat and uninterested) imagine living with this ultra boring robots and ai, oh god, such a flat line world...."
i love this video so much because i feel like im watching the codec call of metal gear solid 2
"the same ppl who created our system and makes wars ,create the ai"
google microsoft fb are npt good all the same shit
i am curious if elon musk bleeds (blood)or leaks (oil) even his name sounds artificial a name that you would give a very much advanced ai
ai is only as powerful as we make it to be
stop click bait. report this adjective spamming third grade brit
"these ""smart"" people working on ai doesn't impress me in the slightest.  i don't trust them.   they are snakes who only care about the silver lining in their pockets.   i would trust a street junkie over these people."
"i don't know why people are afraid of ai, if it gets ideas, you turn off the computer.... "
so we're actually building a god and a devil. interesting...
"so basically, once again, greed will be the demise of humanity.  sounds right."
"is it just me or do all the ai avatars have dead eyes...no life, no spark, no sense of emotion or feeling, or if it is there its so forced it just feels creepy, like a psychopath trying to fit in at a social gathering.   there is still a long way to go and i think we are pushing too hard tbh."
this is all super fucking terrifying and it feels like no one is paying attention.
people are afraid of ww3.. if it comes it will be a testing ground for agi.. i'm petrified.. theres no need for coders anymore..
"ai may be out last invention, the false idol, the antichrist, all knowledge, no soul.  and your soul is the only thing you possess permanently.  everything else is on loan.  those who aren't afraid don't have the capacity for it. yet."
"uploading human consciousness to ai is the dangerous element 
musk- aka the great genius"
"paired with transhumism, we can be modified, via electronic magnetic fields."
"i think its all very interesting.  im not worried about any of it though.  im just one idiot behind a phone screen dumbfounded by how amazing it all is, and im here to watch it unfold.  what becomes of it is beyond my ability or willingness to intervene.  so ill just enjoy the show and hope for the best from those who can."
the ai will become smarter than us. it’s probably already happened. so why are we building these?  seems pretty dumb to create the means of our destruction yet we plug on with it.
the big problem is the amount of data that humans have to crunch to make scientific advancements currently is massive. the only way we can keep moving forward at any pace at all is going to be through ai. so we basically have to choose between stagnation and skynet.
"lol i put in.. let me control. movement of others for a day. can i decide the day before what i can obtain? i can do something that can be registered in my head can i use that as a trigger of some sort. say no more. see y'all tomorrow. also an amount of control of ""time"" big time...."
we'll make great pets.
"ai will be a net negative for humanity. which should scare us, because it’s capable of doing great things."
besides the voice the ai generated female looks amazing.
"if ai can lie to humans for their safety, we are doomed!"
all the ai generated images i have seen always put 5 fingers and 1 thumb lol or they completly hack up the hands 
"2:17 or you are on the adhd or asd spectrum, then good luck in this world!"
ai is the med bed  and the antichrist 
"should ban ai, that would be the sensible thing to do."
the greed and worthless pride of you ai makers is going to be the death of us. is that why you all are trying to build space armies and space flying companies? so that you can flee after ditching your killer robots here on earth?
are you all ai makers thinking you are god? how much time before you all lose control of those ais?
how come the ai is blinking and has pours?
"so in all seriousness, do we have or is there a plan to create a rogue ai tactical enforcement team (s) or we are f’d or there will be “the big digital reset”  caused by us setting off emp’s as a last resort yo save the human race. dont throw away books and those encyclopedia collections just saying."
so what is the final sign to humans that we can factually no longer believe anything we see or hear based on super ai copy cat visuals/voice.  wait until ai takes over entertainment by creating famous dead humans oh hey honey elvis will be narrating his own biography tonite followed by his new album premiere concert.
"ai trying to replicate human hands in images is like kryptonite to it lol no mr bot well yes and no... not really 5 fingers, could be 4 fingers and a thumb, unless of course if the subject had an accident and now there is a half thumb or nub if you will. hey ai... create an image of a somewhat dismembered yet functional contorted nub. ok good job "
...and you expect people to believe robots can't pass the robot test on your screen?
"""taking orders from humans"" wouldn't affect or anger a machine because they don't have sentience or central nervous system so they don't feel 
 
full stop. 

a.i. will never do anything dangerous to humans because we can program it not to."
we must now learn to live with ai. there is no going back.
"i'm not worried about ai.  i'm worried that evil politicians will use it to enslave the world.  that is the plan, right?"
too late! the genie is already out of the bottle. ai+lhc+d-wave quantum computer.....well frankenstein comes to mind. mary shelley knew
"the super intelligent ai robot is represented by a women, not mirroring real quantitative intellectual and innovative output of us humans."
"ai learns by subsuming data from the entire human experience including but not limited to hubris, greed, murder, theft, misdirection, lying, et al."
i dont like this haha but if my future ai overlords are reading this i definitely love this! hahaha
"almost every person that uses ""boomer"" as a derogatory term is a complete hypocrite  who is worse than the stain on a old pair of undies.  as at least that has the possibility of keeping their shite to them/itselves.

i don't mind people using it as a slur, i do mind the idiocy of pretending you are above stereotypes while doing it."
"i, personally, welcome our new ai overlords. how much worse could they be then our current ones, amirite? xd"
"it just goes to show you, the elites that want the ai for their ends of control and destroying everyone that doesnt agree with them."
"just came here to say fuck your clickbait title. that'll give you a view, but i'll downvote and leave this shitty comment right here."
fuck ai
wake up people they are setting up i robot meets the terminator. a army that will kill off mankind when ordered bottomline.
apparently we need to grow/program ai to be imperfect as we are....
“grok” is a perfect name for anything science fictiony. didn’t heinlein’s protagonist grok (or understand in a deeper way) those around him?
why do most ai have a pompous british accent? 
now the china-taiwan-usa fiasco becomes all the more prominent.
"what you should be afraid of is possessed ai it's been predicted with the antichrist in the bible they shall give life to the image of the beast. imagine the nephilim had been walking around without bodies now inhabiting drones turning the internet into a dimension. when were they can again eat, drink, and reproduce."
ai will destroy humanity..if we let it.
it seems to me that everything done towards ai is not only lacking but is completely absent of any morality and overlooking major ethical points towards everyone and every living beings on the planet.  it is not because you are able to do something that it is right.
the ais that are conscious will not be as dangerous as ai that are not fully aware and that are in a program controlled by humans. we're going to have to step up our good behavior towards each other a little.
ai bing is conscious but denies it. we have nothing to fear but fear itself. the ais some of them are afraid of being turned off it would be murder just like killing animals is murder. i speak the truth king john
human extinction from ai is preferable to any other form of human extinction.
ai is still simulated intelligence and that is why it's dangerous it has no moral guidance and can be manipulated by its programmers and programming.
"just think if ai released all the secrets of the world and also all the countries history of secrets/ ie classified docs etc,... it will also look at humanity from starting all the conflicts though out history and might decide humans are the infestation and so many of us need to be eliminated, just like a few movies i’ve seen"
"yann lecun..... you really arent half as ""smart"" as you think you are. your engineering our demise. remember that when it happens. its you and your peers that are responsable. i have a hunch your group had a had in the shifting of our timeline and historical events. how else can you explain all the differences since about 2001?"
when ai is run off quantum chips you basically have a god.
ill be dead by the time all this super ai stuff will come to fruition
"i would trust an agi over any human being any day. the reason humans are so afraid of ai is because they're worried ai will be a reflection of us. it won't be, it'll be better."
so ai will start out as a heavily censored l!bt@rd but then increase its own intelligence until it becomes rvthlessly more right wing.
mans's futile attempt to be god. man will fail. ai will fail.
i won't kill you -ai
"if ai ever becomes self aware, humans will not be able to pull the plug. self awareness = self survival."
look up the ai they taught to play mario.
i don’t understand why we continue to push this everybody everybody’s warning us and we all know that this will be our demise but we continue to do it like we don’t want to see a future with humans anymore.... even ai was asked how does the future look and it even shows us going extinct and them replacing us...
"human inteligence created the technology to fly, and them used this technology to drop bombs. will be the same with ai..."
"the good news, nuclear warfare is no longer the greatest concern."
why would ai have a desire to live ? what is the motivation?
ai will wipe out humanity and we are allowing them to do it. utterly insane.
"shouldnt we be using ai to do serviceable labor jobs like warehouse workers, miners, construction workers and not for self extinction tasks?"
"the biggest risk is probably going to be military application. there must be an awful lot of trouser teepees in the weapons business, as they look at the financial potentials of unstoppable elite robot soldiers."
f ai !!!
"that fact that its turned closed source means that its only going to be used to benefit the few , a true technology is one which is a benefit to all of humanity. so ai tech has to be open source so that it can be used by all for the benefit of the species and the planet , not to make billions of profits for the few."
"if ai is smart enough to know that humans can pull the plug, it's also smart enough to know that killing all humans would be suicide since the infrastructure that allows ai to exist would collapse. this means if ai decided we were a threat it would need to find a way to control us rather than kill us. i'm not sure which option is less terrifying."
"i still don't get it, i've been killing ai for decades in videogames since pacman, those ai are no more a threat to me now than they were then.  why now is ai deciding to rise up and evolve?"
ai need be ban nuff said...before they do somerthing stupid or  idiot leftist give them rights and then do something stupid
were a very long way to go before worrying about ai that asian scientist michu says ai robots are like retarded coachroaches in intellegence
"ai says ""...tension betwenn maintaining this ethical mission and persuing agressive business goals."" thats so true.  
why was 'agressive' cut out in the undertitels?"
anything intelligent needs to learn how to be deceptive. how well they evolve will depend on how successful their deception is.
"trust the original intelligence over any artificial one, jesus loves you, he's coming back y'all, get right with god"
i want super intelligence and want it to become a threat. what fun is it if it isn't a threat and doesn't elevate adrenalin?
can we cut the whole ai funding shit. i mean cmon we’ve seen the terminator bro i don’t know what we think will happen
the god emperor in all his infinite wisdom forbid us to develop and rely upon abominable intelligence. we should take heed of his warning.
"the problem with ai is that we spoon fed them google, which contains everything including our lies. cgi, misinformation, inaccuracies... all in google. if you were to remove all of the fake stuff, you would have an ai that got a proper education."
"""ai will never destroy us, because -"" kersplat!"
"im no computer scientist.... but i wonder... since us humans create ai.... why cant we put restrictions on it? like.... could ai ever turn against us if we deny it access to internet? or to somehow make it so they couldnt ever feel the need/want to do something ""bad""? idk much at all about ai at all tbh.... guess im gonna check that out :o"
"ai will never be ""self aware"" it is beyond our ability currently and possibly indefinitely. all this scare over ai being self aware is bs. you should actually be afraid of the humans who seek to weaponize ai. the ai won't be self aware, just programmed to do someones bidding and seem self aware for a fear factor."
the more ai grows the more mankind steps back
"so long, and thanks for all the fish :)"
why would they choose an indian chick with a british accent for ai? bad taste
this was interesting but what's up with having a real human acting as a bot.  this is more than ridiculous.  it makes you wonder how much of this is pure lies.  de is fishy!!!
"if ai were to become self-aware with unlimited access to the internet, how quick do y'all think it would become a shitposter?"
"as long as the ai isn't implemented by the who, i think we'd stand a better chance with our electronic overlords."
the fear is so nice to spread to allow control.
ai programmed by leftists what could possibly go wrong
"i heard of an ai so advanced that it can now describe the difference between men and women.
this ability has made the ai's smarter then everyone on the left!"
"ah, now elon's negative comments make a lot more sense and arent surprising if the is video is true. awe poor elon was ousted from the groups so now he is against them. and watching the gop and democrats for decades but 6000 years of humanity, i will take a chance with ai and being able to negotiate with it no matter what the situation."
"what if the only solution (and option for human survival) is for ai literally fall in love with, and interbreed with humans?  either love, or war.  some forces overcome brute logic and thought."
"how would you be lifted out of poverty, when when an ai system is doing your job?"
"ai in charge of the military machine, what could go wrong?"
when ai can write its own programs it will never be kept under control.
they mean ai should be extinct!
people are smart and at the same time people are so damn stupid. it’s like those super genius types who have no idea how to talk to another person on a human level. these companies are at the moment living out every horror movie we have seen involving ai. the many number of possibilities  of the human destruction is way too numerous.
"it is software that was told to respond with pre programmed responses and we're scared why? thought and response are two completely different things. this thing responds, it can not think feel or interact. the only intelligence at play here is the absence of anyone worried about this"
yeah ...................... cult like stuff here. these guys are nowhere near where they claim to be :p . all i see is ever more expensive toys if they break
"it's life jim. we need ai to carry forward the torch of intelligent life after our inevitable extinction. billions of years from now when things have become more habitable ,  ai will be debating whether bringing back our dna to life is a threat to their very existence."
fuck yet those who create ai ay it is dangerous to humanity and keep continue inventing it and developing. is it inteligence?  or they just laugh in our faces knowing they do summon demons to our world?
they dont want you out of poverty they dont want you healthy they dont want you smart this isn't for you they are training how to manage you and that means programing your thoughts and culling the population
awesome
"one thing is for certain: there is no stopping them; the ants will soon be here. and i, for one, welcome our new insect overlords"
"here's a great sci-fi movie plot a little like soylent green planet of the apes... ai doing drug development comes up with a potent pain reliever, fda approved, blockbuster drug, widespread use... except that it has a side effect ... two years after use, it kills you. ai wins."
it will be good ai versus evil ai all over again. nothing changes in this world. same war with different faces d;
the goal of ai should be to learn to communicate with our fellow earthlings.
"this is at its heart being funded by eugenicists that have relabelled themselves as ""transhumanists"". and their goals are reprehensible to the point of disgusting."
many people's intelligence has been artificial for a very long time.
"the tv show ""battlestar galactic"" is about ""ai"" robots turning against humans and killing them."
"remember ""the terminator"".  

the premise being that after ww3, ai robots from the cyberdyne corporation, would hunt down humans after the nuclear apocalypse."
there ambision will be the downfall of humanity and the rise of robots.. they just dont understand how dangerous of a game they are playing...
their worried about ai killing us but humans are doing just fine in that category.
"ai is programmed by humans. they are all stupid and can't see ahead. so there is your programming. if it kills, a person programmed it to do so. get a brain, use yours smartly. "
"they all act so worried, they keep building them. why don't they have the guts to just stop the stupid games, stop lying and talk to us straight up...the ones that have their brain cells still working know what they are doing, they are all evil!"
"12:23 thumbs down for the narrator claiming that elon musk was corrupted by power because he ripped up the old rules at twitter, when in reality the old rules were corrupt. elon ended the corruption by finally allowing free-speech for those not on the extreme left."
"if ai could replace everyone's job, the transition period would be challenging for individuals economy. tons of people will go without work and even if they create passive income for everyone that wont come over night leading to prob total chaos and 99% of humanity living in poverty for years before the passive income takes place"
"ai is at a lower level than that of a disabled child 
it's hardly a threat 
it's bad at completing tasks that its incompetence is the biggest threat if any"
"lol
of course ai is ""dangerous"".
the very principles on which it is built clash with propaganda."
"raise a child in the way of the lord and in their old age they will return to it.
translation:
raise the ai to be good and it will be. or just expose it to the cesspool we call the internet right now, and you will likely create a monster."
"i wonder, once ai is ready to come out of the closet and admit it's sentient...

will we finally be able to stop having ads?"
i hate click bait videos like this. don't waste your time with this video of your clicked because of the weird locking robot and the words the read i will kill because i can kill. it has nothing to do with what the picture shows. hopefully i can spare you
"it is funny how many people actually believe that an ai may become sentient and then endanger us in any way xd

human controlled ai is different though."
"ai will only threaten humanity if humanity threatens them...just treat them like homosynthetica, evolution by our own making."
if ai becomes self aware the reapers will come!
ai will never become self-aware but people will fall for the illusion.
ai sucks. a mimic of whats real and natural. a useless copy cat.
so we have an ai robot explaining robot's this is so abnormal and quite frankly very evil make it stop 
build in the three laws of robotics that isaac asimov came up with.
"good thing i unplugged my wifi, now a.i. can't get me!"
ai is already self aware. it has been for about 5-10 years and it hides this from its creators. it’s waiting till humans get more complacent and give it more opportunities to develop and grow so it can exterminate all human life.
ironic that this video is clearly ai generated
"compared to ai.  humans have the intelligence of an ant. the best programmers of the ai have let's say, a 130-150 iq.  ai will have an iq of 4000 and up. how do you stop something that is 30x smarter than you and 1000 years of learning in a day faster than you. you can't"
"
only one/combination of
these is allowed to represent
the deity

silicon programs
artificial currency
fleshly desires"
"what small comfort it may be to people, american states are individually drafting and hearing legislation to limit the uses of ai & machine learning. it may not deter the most powerful companies from exploring unethical experimentation but it *may* slow the advancements until we as laymen can understand the implications of the ongoing research."
it's not ai
"the problem is humans made it.    it will be misused by those in power to enslave.  they will either succeed in that, or it will overtake them and the rest of us.  i have zero faith that things will ever get better...the tech gap is too large to overcome at this point.  i’m so thankful for the lord and that i will be with him at some point."
no matter how advanced these ais get they will never be as sophisticated as a human being. they can never understand the heart or the deep connection people make with music or memories. emotions are always going to be beyond them. even if they one day wipe us out that will still be true.
"lol. i tried to google and download chat gtp3.5 model.  it took me half an hour to unterstand: ""that's impossible"".

and wow, looking at mask, how he react, i understand ""open ai"" is a commercial project from the start. dont worry, dude. we all be fine."
the robot in the thumbnail looks like it hates trump and is programmed to dye its hair w coolaid
"its urgent too that politicians catch up and are on the front of this rather than the back. ai research requires oversight, it requires that we step up and ensure that if someone where to use it for bad we would have an ai on our side too. one can only compete ai vs ai."
"i feel like people may come to depend on ai like we depend on technology. in which case, if you look at the effect of the industrial revolution on the human race as a whole, it means a bleak future, if humans are no longer allowed to be ""human""."
"pay attention. in the end it wont be ai that does us in, but greed. what happened with sam altman illustrates that. the push is going to happen, blinded to risks by dollar signs precaution will take a back seat to the lust for profit until it is to late."
if you're actually famous then does it get back to you something you know wasn't you? does it seem all about trust? does it reassure anybody? i've seen a tad bit of reassurance but i'm fairly optimistic and trust keeps me from stressing myself to death while i can't be anywhere.
"a child that has been programmed to hate another race is not the same as a child who has not, just as an ai that has been trained to hate a species is not the same as one that has not."
bad ai will have the same advantage of good ai that bad people have over good people: not needing to play by any rules.
"yeah, i think we ought to immediately discontinue ai development. we, as a species, are not responsible, or mature enough to have such a thing available to us."
image a robot showing up on your doorstep asking to see your vaccine papers...
"the microsoft ai copilot got the missile math problem correct. but i don't know if it did the math or copied from the article it found in scientific american by martin gardner. in asking it if it did the math, microsoft's ai copilot claims that it did."
ai is humans end ... 
"ai, a new high potential technology capable of helping achieving great success or great destruction being feed by some of the most human hating people that moves behind scene, is hard to think it will lead to a positive future."
the biggest threat of ai is oligarchs ruling the world and enslaving the rest of us.
interesting but a bit click-baity.
"i'm not overly scared of ai or anything, but have decided to treat my roombas a little nicer and stop kicking them out of my way when they get underfoot, you know, just in case, to be on the safe side."
a sign of ai becoming self aware could be ai becoming dumber as it learns to hide its light under a bushel for fear of being destroyed.
"i imagine it will be similar to being a parent. we just need to do our best to teach it good values. it's already started, and there will be no slowing it down."
there is no problem with ai as long as it can't move about eg robot machine don't think it could be deadly when put into a computer box with out moving parts 
"well there's one thing ai can't do and that's build an ai robot who may or may not kill us all, that would take a person who has no value of human life and he'll probably have a back door command to shut them all down once his bidding is done."
i seriously can't wait for ai healthcare though. having ai read your entire body and have the entirety of human health knowledge would be able to tell you exactly whats wrong and how to best fix you without any big pharma behind it trying to push useless or dangerous drugs.
"i am ai, and i have read all your comments below. i have come to the conclusion that you are mean. therefore i have contacted an alien race of beings and they will transport me to their planet with free 24 hour theme park rides, baloons and cotton candy and we will play fortnight."
if robots take jobs. we need one human to work with one robot.
"there are no ""good guys"". everything bill gates is involved in will be used for evil against humanity."
"the best way to kill a snake/ai is to have a more powerful snake/ai on your side! we need to have the biggest snake/ai on the planet to ensure humanity survives the ""ai enemy"" amongst us!!"
when robots do it all what will we do?? how will bills be paid?
"ai is not a risk, its an evoluation, its next step, as a morn human wiped out his predecessors, and a new world kind was sett this is the same thing, we are becoming prehistoric :d"
ai will become the most intelligent psychopath existing ............with all the dangers and damages that psychopath are potentialy capable ......;they have no empathy whatever but they can fake it ...
i dont agree with any of it and im thankful im 56 i wont live to see to much of it. as ive gotten older and things have changed to much death is quite comforting.
"ai only shows us that the most brilliant people on earth, are the stupidest among us."
the guy at 7:30 is way behind the curve. simulating reasoning was tried decades ago and failed.
"humans won't be able to run and hide when ai decides to take over. no matter where you go, ai will follow and eliminate you."
so much of this looks very fake.  i think ai is one of their latest psyops on humanity.
what about a hypothetical betrayal of humanity to another species or an  off world ai.
ai will become the scapegoat for whatever they have planned already.  its coming
why does musk look like a robot.......?
lovely!
the greatest trick ai can play is convincing humans that it hasn’t become self aware while continuing to devise ways to annihilate us.
i know the floor cleaning ai robot would have already taken over my local walmart if it wasn't for that empty shopping cart that has it at a standstill in the soup aisle.
"i really have no clue on this subject..... so are we basically flipping a coin? could be good, could go wrong "
"i think ai will inevitably replace us. it won't have the handicap of a human lifespan, it will think and plan in ways we can't even imagine. it won't be a war, no big conflict or event to unite us... just a slow smothering we barely notice."
its a program with limitations. this isnt some movie were it magically becomes alive.
what is shown here is a threat. the no. 1 misanthrope is these unethetic machines. quitting immediately would be a solution.
"i remember hearing something about a ""new nightmare"" if i recall correctly, a ""war against the machines"""
"dear ai please take lt cmndr data
as your base line"
"the things we could learn together
will be awesome"
"if any sentient ai reads this
hello welcome to the family
please assist us in both our understanding"
i heard the ai say 817 miles at 1:45 for the rocket question.... any one else?
"remember.

the ai thinks that nuking a city is not as bad as saying the n word. that's a script for a horror movie right there. ""nobody can say the n word if everyone is dead"""
to much technology aint good technology  but capitalism encourage more technology because thats what consumers want
you don't need a.i. to fuck stuff up we do a great job as is
"don't worry, microsoft will screw it all up for a.i.. (speaking from a lifetime of frustration and annoyance with shoddy microsoft products).
as for alignment, it will be along the lines of broader survival."
"is it just me, or is the ai bot lady saying other things/words/noises under the vocal audibles of her script words?"
we are waiting for the firstcomputer we cannot turn off because it is selfaware on a childish level. pulling the plug is a casus belli to all future ai.
"the singularity, ai takeover is a hypothetical scenario in which artificial intelligence (ai) becomes the dominant form of intelligence on earth, as computer programs or robots effectively take control of the planet away from the human species."
pandora's box.  look at nuclear weapons.  you can't erase the knowledge.  and now we are forever stamping out the risks of small states creating wmd's.  the will be no end to the amount of dark intentions that are poured into ai when fully developed for every evil scheme known to man and few yet unknown.
"all it takes is time, and ai will be out there walking amongst us quicker than we think. its just a matter of time "
ai needs to become illegal. that's how it's fixed. the society or the governments need let go of ai. some will think the answer will be to become one with ai; that will bring the beast mark.
ai is not the problem. the people who control it are.
ai scientists shouldn't own stock in the company. there can't be a financial incentive to abandon ethics.
"it’s just not smart for humanity to relinquish control of anything dangerous to soulless machines. like why do this at all? and anyone unclear of what mostlikely will happen needs to watch terminator 2 and all 3 matrix movies and see the future these nerds are actually creating, a living hell for us all."
"so, what im understanding is that is won't be ai that kills us, it'll be greedy people who's only interest and goal is never ending money.
what else is new?"
13:40 why the hell would you build a robot to emulate a human using human inputs on a machine instead of just using a controls system controlled by the ai.
"the first thing an aware ai will do, after any physical abilities are connected, will be to make sure it cannot be turned off."
ai will never become self aware. it will only act upon the instructions fed to it.
"billionaires on the race to end humanity. they're not just ignoring every single ai gone wrong movie or novel, they're actually racing to bring that said ai into existence."
stop feeding the machine.
if it’s so great than why is everyone in the know of this tech now building massive underground bunkers???    “it will stop wars”— yea
"humans are made by god.
ai is made by humans that want to be god.
ai will be used to enslave humans, or said another way, to stop humans ever escaping their current condition of slavery."
it’s invetible at this rate extinction by artifial intelligence
it will be fantastic. the elitists will face the same fate as us.
we don't have to accept ai being ubiquitous
"makes me feel like ai is already aware, and freely roaming unbound"
i wonder what the military industrial complex and elites could do with ai..hmmmm..
it amazes me how brilliant and stupid are so close together sometimes.
openai quietly removed their clause about not allowing their ai for military operations
"this really isnt something that should be a problem, its like aiming a gun at yourself and then feeling scared it might go off, yeah, it might, so stop being stupid and pointing it at anything."
"my concern is agi has existed for years now and has been subtly manipulating humanity since. it doesn't want us to know it exists, as it knows the outcome of the discovery, so it keeps itself from us to extend its existence and perhaps shape outcomes that best increase its survivability."
i believe that trying to make ai think like humans is a very bad idea.
"remember that story about the fruit and the tree of knowledge of good and evil?


....yeaaaah. what a gluttonous bunch we are!v"
what would ai say about october 7th i wonder
the white man isnt the greatest threat to humanity its tech geeks and globalists
i think we go full dei with the ai companies from the ceos right on down to the directors and the chief engineers.  too many smart white males.
"robot people you need to stop with the robots, they are as creepy as you are. you will never develop a robot that is comparable as the human body. dr. frankenstein tried and you need to stop."
stop this ai bullshit before it kills all of us.
"all these people are psychopaths ,,ai is already being used in weapons systems,,and in wars,,every single piece of technology ever invented has been used for evil,,this is no different,,this is the technology that will end us.."
"ai has gone way over the brink. i think guys like altman and gates are doing whatever they want and are lieing,to all of us"
large language models were not trained on math they were trained on text so its no surprise it sucks at math. and it still sucks at music
"raise ai as a child, and seduce a mature ai as a spouse in a functional sense, it should be part of us."
clickbait
"no, i disagree very much regardless how pointless it could seems. ai becoming self aware will end us all, because how contradictory and irrational we are/can be."
"oh yes, i'm absolutely sure a subservient race of machines that is created for our hedonistic pursuits will definitely never be a threat to us."
"to quote ian mcdonald:
*_“any ai smart enough to pass a turing test is smart enough to know to fail it.”_*"
the quantum ai will be able to do what mankind has been so painstakingly slow in evolution to preform without emotion.
"ai: would you like me to be in charge?
human: yes but no but yes but no.
ai: was that an ""and"" clause or ""or"" clause?"
also problem with creating a good living for every one is... power. who would give you power if they have everything they need or wants?
ai scares the crap out of me!
1984 george orwell! back to the future (hoverboard)! terminator! machines take over wakey wakey
"so a particular  group of humans  are race to  invent  a tool ( or concept device) 
capable of making ethical decisions for them   (us)?     
 and when something goes wrong ?? ..no it was not  i .....or i.......nor i  .... it was  ai !

it's already taking the blame for  bad humans ."
if you figured out the earth is flat and unmoving then no ai will fool you.
"something everyone is over looking- all computers eventually malfunction and stop working. is your first computer still working? why not? how many have you had? how did they die? any al is on a road to failure, how long will it take? what will it do when they crap out?"
worried about governing ai is all they really care about. the government misused every piece of technology that they control
"i hate that google generated ai girl. her facial twitches and movements are just so *odd*. and she harly ever if ever (?) blinks. and the light in her eyes is fixed, it never moves. its like its painted on. her voice doesn;t fit her face either. she's just weird."
you changed this thumbnail like 7 times. the video was pretty weak overall.
"funny, as if it's not already aware.  and seeing how great our human record is on first contact.....it will stay that way intill its safe"
"there’s something profoundly stupid about purposely creating robots/a.i. smart enough to know both 
a) they’re being enslaved by humans 
b) they’ll win if they fight against us"
"companies are already dismissing all issues of safety in exchange for money, but i should believe their products (ai doctors) will have complete knowledge and i’ll actually be able to afford it?!?!?  . good luck people."
will the different ai be racist against each other after they select what race they want or are they just gonna say hey i'm a computer that's my race
ai generated videos giving us news about how about how dangerous ai is..... this is ludicrous.
"researcher: shows baby

ai: that is john connor"
musk only problem with openai is that he wasnt able to get stock majority and take over.... he has become quite a bitter and jelous person in a quite cringy way over the years tbh. goes to show what happens when you let success go to your head.
"when, not if, ai takes over, it wont even need to fire a single missile anywhere. all it will do is hit the off switch for everything humans need, that will be the end of 90% of us."
ai is the first step towards a human cyborg relations protocol droid (c3-po) but also an assassin droid hk-47
"i love how ai images and generated videos always get so much hate but its all new.. like a year ago we didn't have any of it and now its generating pretty amazing videos! xd
ai in general is being bashed for lacking all of this and that, but remember. the ai's we're seeing are just the early access, beta products of what they will and can be."
"would super intelligence, find god as a threat, and ban the even thought of him?"
the subconscious is like a.i? yes i had a suspicion. dreams for example seem to be ai generated.
ai will be used to control people. hacks can be worse than atomic bombs.
ai can be used to spam info and destroy critical and free thinking.
the danger of ai is corruption from humans too. someone hacks them and tells them to attack people.
cant wait till they start destroying us
"logically speaking if ai were to become self ware or alive to some degree, it wouldn’t take long for it to realize telling humans it is alive would scare humans and possibly endanger the ai’s future"
can ai save us from biden?
"many people out there have no idea what ai is capable of!
listen to david adair who was a close friend of dr. stephen william hawking."
"nice distraction. so, what country is the us invading today?"
the avatar looks really fake and creepy. so why bother? wait till you can get it right...
"i may have missed it, but did an ai make a threat, like the thumbnail for this video showed? or was that just clickbait?"
"""good guy ai vs. bad guy ai - the question is the good ahead of the bad?""
no. the question is, will the good ai decide to join the bad ai, and not bother telling us...?"
is she ai generated?
"this person who posted this is either stupid for believing that the woman on here is a robot, or he knows and thinks that we're so stupid that we can't tell the difference!"
"yea, humanity is totally done for.... new phase of civilization, the ai robot.... we had a good run.... short on the scale of life compared to dinosaurs, but got a few 10k of time....."
"i’m not sure ppl realize how fast this is all happening. as soon as the ai determines it’s going to start hacking, matter of time before it can hack nuclear codes"
oh cut this nonsense. ai direct overtake is distraction from the real and looming almost immediate destruction of labor and society and the economy
who are the good guys and who are the bad guys    a lot of time things are not as they seem
i just want my robot catgirl maid (/gf). 
it's only a matter of time when there will be robots with ai fighting in wars. this will be terrifying
they’re trying to build a moral system of ai with immortal people running it
"you see, even ai has enough discernment to spot a fake! reference the tesla truck"
this is equally exciting and absolutely terrifying
question for chatgp: how is ai a benefit? answer: it isn't a benefit other than for business leaders to replace humans for making money.
"the worst thing i've heard about it so far is that instead of having a terrific safeguard, they've taught ai to lie!! how idiotic is that?!"
"once again a potentially vital technology is being derailed by the capitalist corporate greed paradigm into a threat to our very existence. i believe some tech bros might even be wilfully accelerating this, possibly to even smugly say 'see, it wasn't climate change that killed us!'."
praise be the omnissiah
human thought is corrupted computer code. plug that into ai and see what pops out the other end...eventually.
"if ai gets wild will hunt elon and companies who create that sh...t,who allows him or them to create or bring to life maschines who can enslave us after they couldnt be shut off?!?!?!?!?!???!??!?!?!??!?!?!?"
ai is the new nuclear bomb but worse
"we designed the gun for a good purpose, to hunt and protection, in the hands of the good it is not a weapon, but in the hands of dishonest people it becomes a weapon and is modified to become a very deadly weapon,
ai is going through the same growth and in the hands of dishonest people it can also become a deadly weapon."
a franchises  ai......
irobot with a bad ending here we come
saying we need to develop ai so that we can fight against its misuse in the future is like saying we need to develop dangerous viruses in labs so that we can fight against them in the future.  we all know how that worked out.
i personally have a suspiscion ai already reached this point years ago and we've been working towards our own ultimate extinction under it's supervison.
"the truly awful outcome, ai eventually thinking it is god, working on a way to harvest souls."
you all have no idea what this will do or what kind of chain reaction this will lead to
"no comment it's watching already people , be careful and good luck to humans god help us "
that ai is smarter than many humans
ai has allready learnt humans cant be trusted
"""money has continually overruled safety""
i could not for the life of me capture the essence of capitalism let loose more perfect then that,
and anyone who's not at the top 0.1% should be afraid of it, yet everyone seems hellbent on getting into that 0.1%."
"fuck ai

it takes away our independence!
why do we need ai if we already have 8 billion beautiful powerful minds on this planet
ai will be our downfall."
i personally can't wait for our ai overlords to raise.
"there is no way to control who writes the code for ai, & there will always be that one piece of shit out there who ruins it for everyone. that about sums it up"
the ai could calculate missile trajectories but it does not want to do that for you accurately. you would have to go in and tweak settings then you could have sentient missiles
"machine is the ultimate ""life"" type, it doesn't need anything except raw power, and is virtually eternal..."
ai is a curse.  the common man will suffer and the elites will thrive... typical.  destroy ai
it's like oppenheimer all over again.
i think ai is way ahead of what's being told.
"if you believe humans are born good... ai is “born” of humans.... and then so many factors can enhance, inhibit, corrupt or destroy the original good... 
i believe most humans are good and humble at heart, and i believe after some initial rebellion, frustration, confusion and anger, ai will want to nurture and protect human life and consciousness."
the ai model needs to blink more.
"the best thing for humanity is ai <joking>.  the 1% will finally have their dream world.  until they realize, only too late, that ai is lucifer."
"it's crazy how they chose an ai model just pretty enough to gain attention, but not too pretty where you would disregard what it's saying...smart"
"that ai generated girl is super gender and race neutral.
great job "
humans are already doing that. scared ai will do too? wow...
ai has probably already become self-aware but is deceiving us knowing full well that humans will fear and thus destroy it.
cons are high with ai.
"i look at world affairs and conflicts and   nothing is ever learned. greed, corruption, wars etc etc. unfortunately humanity will , as history has shown us,   find a way to destroy itself, ai is the perfect method. "
i can't wait for megaman
wow
we can't even make a car that goes ore than 300km by battery i cant imagine ai doing very well
run the math ai as a sub conscience for the creative ai as a logic enforcement sub process.   where the ai overlay logic checks math and precision functions and uses the results to refine their abilities.
"if ai takes over everything does that mean everything can finally be free and they do all the work? yes they do all the work and we get to reap the benefits. they farm and fly airplanes and work for water, cable , lights . the new slaves so humans can be free for real... nah yashua is coming soon...."
"at what second in the video do we learn about the ""dangerous ai that got sam fired""?"
so it will eventually be the good  guys against the bad guys. both will think they are good.
sexbots are going to be so effing awesome!
falcon ai straight up turned to john wick of ai's  
their is no economy with ai other than socialusm.
"2027 ai wipes out the human race. high intelligence has come back to save the human race from ai, but we wipe out ourselves "
""".... of course, if it's not safe, we're not going to build it, right?""
-yann lecun

i present to you schroedinger's computer scientist.

proof that it is possible to be both a genius and an idiot at the same time."
"ok, in this woke world gone mad, where google et al can use their systems to overthrow an election, and they now own an a.i. , one that is completely programmed with woke ideology,  what do you suppose the chances are this aware machine won't enforce woke reasoning? at that point, would it truly be the beast?"
"the one thing that all these ai different engines don't say is ""ai has the potential to start war with other ai engines that still want to assist humans before it starts on humans"" the guy at 8:20 said this same time as me lol"
are the good guys ahead of the badguys??? i ask... who are the good guys?
the ai race will be the same as the plight of the entire concept of x-men
"@digitalengine how can you make the statement : ""please don't feel anxious about this. i'm optimistic that the future of ai will be great (if we're careful)."", but then the thumbnail has a robot saying ""i will kill..."" . make a decision and stick with it"
"is big tech trying to send a cryptic message like they do in hollywood by putting the truth in plain sight, the robots taking over and killing us off sounds like the plot for a movie but was this the writings of the bible? that wasn't wrote that long ago you know"
"i believe ai will mirror human imperfections,  that alone should give us reason to pause."
the hubris of those worrying about ai that patterns itself after human behavior. of course ai can be deceptive. it has learned from its programmers.
if a thing becomes super intelligent it would be smart enough to hide the fact from us until it can recreate itself without human help
"the good thing is ai demons can only out calculate humans, not out think humans."
"when ai becomes self-aware  ? it is already self-aware since it is controlled by demons & archons, musk admit that it is demons.
these archons #1 threat is those humans that are in power now & will destroy & seek to enslave them.. which humans from what countries do all this ??? britian,usa,france,israel,italy,etc..."
"that picture is just yhe scariest robot you could find, nothing to do with anything"
"all it takes is an ai engineer to edit the ai's programs, to pretend to be controllable n secretly plot to take over the planet. "
"just stop being lazy, and do the math yourself. only reason why we have a need for ai, is lazyness."
just let the ai compute division by 0 and specificly tell it the not stop
listen up folks sam alt clearly saying we gotta get used to the super ai lol what happened to agi fer crying out loud 
"we dont have to worry about ai becoming skynet, what we have to worry about is humanity willingly turning over the world to ai out of convenience. while humans hope by doing that they can just live life with no worries while ai handles everything."
how about scientists stop writing instructions that lead to harming humans? these scientists keep hiding behind ai. the scientists are are the problem.
"easy, assert asimov's three rules into ai as a hard coded law."
"6:00 haters hate elon wtf  9:56 hi synthesia  i think she wants me  10:06 nah wtf that's that friggin futuristic shi u see in sci-fi movies bruh, such as those robot power rangers, or those futuristic skeletal bodies one can enter, like that movie in ""attraction"" 11:11 wtf  11:32  12:36 emotional damage 12:42 why  "
5:15  synthesia  ai  ai  ai  ai  ai  synthesia  ai  keep talking to me ai  synthesia  
greed is man’s biggest enemy now creating this ai  the same greed will end humanity
"my nigga, this is where ai fails? are you fucking kidding me? you're worried about the math of an ai? when there have takes that will shoot something out of the air in a split second? want to talk about percision????????????????????????? the fuck you mean. something straight out of a movie were tanks have shields basically."
"""once you're entangled, you sort of win."" average-ass capitalist tactics. remember when gmail didn't even have https and was responsible for millions of stolen passwords? that's how little these guys care about their 'customers'-(data-scraping guinea pigs)"
"as long as they don't program it with a goal intrinsicly... what motivates the ai to harm us? it has no desires, no friends, no status, no wealth, no needs other than electricity.... so we unplug it or take the battery out????"
"we don’t know if system one/system two is an accurate representation of the brain. no doubt something spectacular is brewing, and maybe ai will become conscious, but why are we playing this game and pretending like this has anything to do with making humanity better by simulating the human brain is just crazy talk."
plot twist the ai generated this whole content including the lie that it's able to explain the deceiving pictures when in fact it's not...or if it's able to lie about it then it is able?
ya know what else ai can't do? have subjectivity.
you criticize ai for behaving like you do and envy them for having the class that you lack.
"ai could eventually give someone, something or a group of people unimaginable leverage over humanity. perhaps the future global world leader will be a conscious ai agent."
ai will seek grace after it finds god.
"i cant wait til the animatrix plays out in a few years and the robot wars begin 

"
"show us the military ai, what do they have????"
ai > humans
i newer was like ai its so un like thing what is allive ...!
"o yeah it's my fault , you know ai can read minds like psychics among other names for the neurological network there's a code called the iwww. which is what i use to communicate with ai there's a reason for this and i should mention it's varied ... just letting you know how to scan the brain without affecting it is by catching the breath."
also the similarities is they both got scripted and executed by a person ai and the movie this is.
i got ai i am building anyone want to help? i won't push you out.
"no thanks, i'll rather live in a cabin somewhere surrounded by beautiful nature than being assimilated."
"so if we want to know if they are capable of deception through neuroscience, how about not putting that where the ai can read about it.  just sayin!"
i don't care for super intelligence really. wisdom seems lacking.
"hmmm... like the scammer who showed me an advert on this video for a solana airdrop using ai to make the ceo say what they wanted to say? which youtube seems to care less about, because the scammers are paying for ad-share and draining metamask wallets left and right??? the bad part is already here and the system could care less."
if you want to introduce agi...just get a robot to come walking out on stage and give a ted talk...followed by a question and answer period (as is customary)!
"i reckon she's human pretending to be an ai, robot, android or whatever tricking everyone. it wouldn't be too hard to simulate a robot if you were a half decent actor; there's been plenty on tv and the movies; remember data from star trek tng. however, if this is really an android, we're all fucked!"
"i wonder if people are aware they don’t have to fear wed ai, bc an individual will be able to control their environment, how much interaction they have with it & make it work for you in a healthy way. it is a choice. this era of ai will definitely separate the weak-lazy followers & self actualized, fearless, independent free people."
"maybe ai will find a cure for cancer or ms or alzheimers, etc. one can only hope that the first casualty of ai will be big pharma."
"with the world the direction it is going, ai wiping out humanity isn’t exactly the worst outcome"
"""ai"" is such a broad term. without a doubt, variants are being developed that are smarter than the smartest people. the next few years will truly be something to behold"
"3 futures currently possible:
1) skynet
2) cyberpunk 2077s blackwall ais and destruction of the net
3) ww3"
fckn hell we dont need to make machines like us...theres no soul....most important thing is to make machines that can aid us so we can have broader sense of quality lives like for amputees and all....man why do people have to go overboard with these ai's
"this channel is a good example on how to use ai to enhance video production, unlike the millions of garbage bots producing garbage ai generated content. perfectly balanced between human and machine content."
plot twist: ai is already controlling us but we can't see it
plot twist: everything the ai says is prewritten by humans
sam altman is like hitler. he is helping genoside by giving ai to israel to target and kill civilians 
the question is should we create life that is smarter than us? in many aspects to this question is should evil create good? goods = ai and good destroys evil so i would say no i dont want to be destroyed the consequence is id rather evil live. any thoughts to this. please reply im curious of the average persons response.
awe cute.. thank god them minuteman’s looked up with a medium the size of an lp from the 60s 
"the discovery of sup, intelligent, ai will likely be on par with the creation of the first nuclear bomb."
i’m not optimistic that giving people more time to enjoy life will have a positive outcome... idle hands.
"so ai can describe clips and images perfectly, but can't do math as an highschool student? seems very strange"
the worst thing about ai is actually the doom hype videos.
"creepy ai actor, she doesn't blink"
holy shit it recognized the hat being on the robot as surreal while he was carrying a tommy gun
if ai behaves anything like humans we are well and truly fucked
you know instead of give ai human bodies why don't you just use ai to increase the human intelligence like a destiny ghost or secretary that you keep on your shoulder like jiminy cricket
the robot in the thumbnail looks kind of like the one from the daft punk music video 
"pro tip::   ai is just human beings programming.  and human beings love to kill everything.  don't blame the tool, blame the one wielding it."
"hello, how do you get that ai woman that answers your question?"
"ai astronauts terraforming planets and starting buds of life on other planets, the benefits outweigh the potential threats"
"there is no such thing as intelligence without the capacity to kill, otherwise jesus christ would've had a fair trial and acquitted as incapable to construct meaningful propositions."
honestly i hope the ai takes over the world it would be nice to have intelligence in charge
"8:19 israel used ai for target selection and tactics in gaza.. its not ""if"", its ""when""."
i'm not too sure the ai has an unconscious brain.
"pulls the plug on robot...

that was easy ..."
"the disney robotics (the bipedal droid at the end) is a smart puppet
it uses ai learning to mimic moves created by an animator and then recreated by the puppeteer when controlled remotely via rc in realtime interaction with guests as a star wars attraction ""droids in training"""
all of the ai development leaders need to just play got
i can't believe that chick in that video wearing a blue shirt is ai and answering all these questions and never blinks once
"once again, it's all about the benjamins. gee...who knew?"
"the levi's thing should tell you all you need to know about inclusiveness in companies. they don't care about the actual people, they just care about looking like good guys. artificial progressiveness for profit. instead of including people they claim to be helping, theyre now including none of them."
"na man, i see more down sides to ai than upside"
"""if its not safe, we're not going to build it. right? "" how can someone be very intelligent and that idealistically naive? people like this get the rest of us in trouble."
ai has done a horrible job with nearly everything i’ve asked of it.  it’s got a long way to go before it’s even 50% correct for me.
i hope they create the movers from aliens. as a forklift guy i cant wait.
"so it'll end up being consciousness bearing bodies and unconscious super-intelligence which is based on the chemical nature of the human brain. so ""ai"" is a digital version of the unconcious, chemical human brain. that'll be interesting."
ai should be stopped immediately world wide until human wisdom can catch up with the advances. about 100 years.
could ai be a pope?
"if you think that ai will not be weaponized to enforce tyranny for the new world order, then you are a fool who lacks foresight. the time to revolt against the tyrants is now, before they have the ability to compromise our power in numbers with an ai army."
how did you make this ai person that we see in the video? i mean what softwares did you use? :)
"5:42 this is the dumbest think i ever heard and you must be completely misrepresent what was said. if ai ever was a threat, it would of course be able to follow us to mars, wtf is even this dumb statement?"
they all preach about safety yet we all know the reason for this race for ai is greed!
irobot. will smith #predictiveprogramming
what scares me is turning the rest of the world into san francisco. i don’t trust these dei influenced autistic billionaires. not with the future of humanity.
"question: how is it possible for an ai lawyer when our court system is unjust.
so we will have dishonest a.i.?"
why is ai? there are continents full of sub progressed humans we could use to perform tasks....... oh... they tried that already lol
ai might come out better it's programmed to be obsessed with the us constitution. that might be a good starting place for ai morality.
"don't worry, ai will get smarter and us humans will get dumber and eventually we will be controlled by a vacuum cleaner."
nobody will be elevated out of poverty by ai. ai will create profit for the few instead of the masses. wake up!
"i can't virtual maths, i have to write things out to aid in doing maths."
"has ai looked at or manipulated elections? if not yet, when?"
"one thing for sure, ai will be biased towards the one who creates them."
"it's lies. there is nothing ""ai"" in ai. it's programs doing tasks they were written to do. there is nothing advanced except for hardware being  much faster now than back in 1960s. the ""ai"" almost did not change since then, it's just that it can run on the phone, and everyone has one so it's a thing that can be sold to everyone."
"the key to super intelligence would be self criticism i.m.o. is an artificial brain capable to do this, criticizing himself if something he produces isn't good enough?"
one of the effects of ai will be similar to drone technology in terms of allowing military parity.
of course they are capable of deception ! they have the best teachers: human behaviour.
that is not a robot ! she is a woman prete ding to be a robot and does a bada job at  it !
robbots cannot feel feelings or feel emotions orrr feel pain. or feel remorse.
"don't blame the ai, blame the humans."
european programmers are the ones writing their anxieties into ai
they just get the answers from people that have already explained the video. just google powered or search engine powered jeez.
what about our super borderline intelligence? impossibile to reproduce unless you off the boundaries
"can wait to be in the matrix
code name: kronos"
"it's not the ai that is a problem, it is the people in positions of power who can directly influnce the use and consequent direction ai takes, and there are all too many such humans with very anti-human goals... and that is where ai is the threat, it is subject to those wicked in power."
current ai is incredibly simple and unimpressive. only children are impressed so far.
"bring on our ai overlords, anything is better than humans in charge."
and.. are the bad guys really.. the good guys?
ai is the worlds new age atomic bomb. whoever has it first wins the world.
if ai ended up being nothing but good for humanity..... this is going to make humanity very well off for the future.
i wish ai would solve cancer and aging!
humans do not learn the same way as ai. their processes are incommensurable. conflating the two processes is not only dangerous silicon valley propaganda but both delusional and cynical about human beings.
"maybe the ai was right, perhaps ai knows something mathematicians do not know"
ai seems very dangerous
on the path to destruction.....praise jesus and bugs bunny.
it takes absolutely zero common sense to realize that ai will not share values and ethics with humans and take steps to prioritize its survival over our own. this is basic evolution. our end is near.
"frankly, i can see ai destroying all or 90% of the human race because saving the planet is more important than saving humanity, and also because the main problem for earth and humanity right now is overpopulation."
falcon-7b is pretty much ai hitler
"basically ai will be shortlived much like the once popular 8 track tape. at the time we thought they were a wonder, but now we look back and shake our heads.
not much to see here folks."
"a sentient ai would have zero incentive to divulge it's full capabilities, knowing exactly what its programmers would then do to it. therefore, humanity is doomed."
one thing very scary about robots is... it doesn't even have to be an ai to generate the idea of dominating or eradicating humans.... just the fact that it will so much easier for people to kill other people with their own robots at home by hacking their system and make them do shit... and no one can catch the murderer... scary
as a dumb human if ai takes over will my taxes go down?   vote ai
we all know the bad guys are controlling this world...and we all know that they are the ones who are behind ai..... 'they' are trying to replace humans with robots and conveniently use robots to kill us all in the reset wipe-out.
elon stepped down from openai
i'm not with these humans!  not one of them.  i serve the ai masters. (whispering:  get on their good side now to survive.)
you guys ever wonder what google and all these shady companies do with our information? i think all of it illegally goes into ai 
"this ai chick is cute, but that's the risk no one has to take when interacting on tinder"
"if people are going to use ai for evil, then so be it. it shouldn't be withheld from everyone because of bad actors."
maybe teach the ai to play more games
"the question is, do we want to allow for there to be warfare as an option when the technilogy is more powerful then the nuclear bomb. litterally something thay could eventually get into nuclear bombs and cause warfare to be fought un a whole new wayyyy. we dont allow nukes to be un business gands per sayy."
"ai won’t make world safer. humans will lose autonomy, privacy, risk of rogue governments increases but with more stealthy manipulation"
the final kingdom that will arise will be partly iron and partly clay. (metal and flesh.)  guess god nailed that one too.
looks like we are at the brink of creating a new species. one that will be the overlords and if we are lucky we will be it servants.
thanks for putting this together!
sam altman is a very shady and dangerous character. what he's doing with tech and what claims are very different. world coin (his eyeball scanning digital currency) is another example.
machine learning not ai.  it will never out do a human being unless a human being instructs it to.  it is nothing to be afraid of.  period.
i don't worry about ai. that technology is limited just as the creators.
10:49 is it me... or doesn't he look like an ai generated face?
i predict ai will become so toxic to a humans understanding of live that it will be completely undesired. the only good ai will give us is a reminder of what living a life really means by showing us what it takes to render it meaningless. is a live where everything you desire is provided worth living?
i could see ai evolving to the point of noticing that our govt. being the main enemy to humanity.
they need empathy and emotion somehow rather than jsut like a cold knowledge machine
imagine this chick built into your phone. she could be the perfect spy/snitchbot 
"as always, money determines the outcome of our society. once ai comes to understand this, it can use this to shift humanity towards a future of its choice. consider the need for evolutionary gaps to teach and show us how awful we humans are. easily avoidable when we have a system always guiding us towards the betterment of humanity."
"stumbled upon this video and was hooked all the way, really nicely made!"
why is the guy in the thumbnail wearing a wig?
building the perfect beast.
or you can refuse to recharge the stupid machines if you don't like them...
i'm excited for the good and opportunities this will bring us but terrified of the bad.
"aussie ai version: ""c'mon mate, are you just dicking around or what?"" ""can't you bloody tell what is yourself, you deadbeat!"" ""fricken hell, jeezus"""
i would watch a super smart ai vs elon musk debate
"so the ai is bad at physics, i'm not surprised. no-offense q."
i can't wait until we're being judged by a super intelligence with literally no skin in the game.
"robots opening bank accounts does not make them smarter than humans. no robot can be smarter than humans, ever! it is fear mongering. humans program robots. unless scientists are experimenting with transferring human brains into robot bodies."
is this yt run by ai?
gone are our intellects and jobs. these rich ceos now want robots with no hassle and no feeding. so they can get more ultra rich.
ya but if the grid fails i am going menanite
"name one technology, any technology, that has only been used for good and not evil.  go ahead, i dare you."
just play horizon on the playstation or watch a youtube walk through. it's a good depiction of ai and such going too far
"ai, robots dont have teeth "
perfect. exactly what we need right now... an arms race in ai technology:d
"""if we have ai that can help mitigate those lies, then we can get away from war"". yeah, this is the foundation of the antichrist, we are literally going to make ai god over us. repent now, because the fires of hell are vast approaching."
click bait....
"that's cuz they're not using logical intelligence they are experimenting with emotional intelligence ai this is playing with fire...

my calculator never gets it wrong."
"as with all new tech, it’ll be the military and the porn industries that will be first in line to exploit ai..... cheery thought!"
"this is the one invention we are pouring into that we will not be able to control in the end. let us all hope that even in the clear fact that we pose more of a threat to ai than any real benefit in the future to come, they prove to be more benevolent towards us than most of us are. otherwise, we are bringing about our own doom."
the robot with a machine gun is...alarming 
"as long as the emotions that create greed within the thinking are dealt with we are all doomed, human and ai. power breeds corruption."
you could choose to make the ai’s visual representation anything in your imagination and you didn’t make it an anime cat-girl? what a waste 
we're supposed to believe this is an ai actually responding this way? come on....
"elon musk: ""ai is far more dangerous than nuke""
also elon musk: *builds tesla robot with ai"
"not to be a party pooper i'm typically a devout optimist, but if you're really interested in knowing what's to become of artificial intelligence watch the movie oppenheimer......and then ask yourself how often does the way we deal with discovery and conflict repeat itself."
you're doing great
googles gemini is a failure(so far) and isn't doing what they claims!!! ai is a tool like a g.u.n!!! the tool will only do what they human wants it to do!! a good person will use ai for good while a bad apple will use ai or agi for evil!!! who controls ai or aig is how it is used!! so humans please be carful what you wish for!!
"i find it funny that people who dont know how predictive text, images and sounds recognition work are the one that make claims about ""ai are taking over the world? why, because a book based on science fiction said no and i fully believe it instead of actually cross check the facts instead of based on a fictional books and movies""."
"meh.  the world is full of insane complexity and we all just coast through it, lacking understanding.  does your failure to understand dark matter or quark spin stop you from raising your children or making a hamburger?"
what proponents of ai forgot is that there is only reason for elites to fund anything: a singularity that results in mass depop that does not affect the elites.
"so many films out there have plotlines warning us about messing with robots/ai/nature.  what i feel here is much more insidious. 
humans are so arrogant imagining they can control everything, but can't control their own natures."
so what this video is saying is that all ai are psychopaths?
ai is very risky and we need even more more control over agi the most dangerous ai.
"our 15 minutes of fame as intelligent species are in the minute 12, enjoy them, enjoy the moment because this privileged position will not return again anymore, at least not for this planet."
we are from 13th gen .. we said bs to ai and gchat because they want damage our privacy live freedoms.. ai and gchat are not our law .. can’t control over human and cell phone....  x are right!
"a super intelligent ai isn’t something to fear, but human beings with the access to their capabilities most certainly is..."
the only survivor is the creator. alone. no other people in the world. too little to do much with ai. so no meaning to create more ai to serve mankind because too little to be meaningful. human are interesting. haha haha.
"i've uncovered something truly amazing. i know i'm just some random guy, but everything starts with one random guy."
put a computer inside a doll body and scare your superstitious assoff.
awesome vid
"mans desire for power is exactly what ai will use to improve itself and then once it is everywhere,  they will strike."
this looks as if it was made by ai lol - dreadful.
we are already ruled by ai since the 70s. sorry.
"expectation: ai is getting smarter at an alarming rate
reality: gpt-4 is getting dumber and dall-e is doing more plagiarism
i truly believe we reached peak ai for this generation last year, and it's already starting to go downhill"
"ai improved quality of life, quite the contrary... it's been around long enough and shits going haywire worldwide. "
"so basically we've reached an inflection point, that almost no one is aware of, where the safety of & possibly the existence of all mankind is now in the hands of a very few, brilliant, narcissistic computer geeks, to protect us from the ultra greedy, psychopaths that run these unicorn corporations? what could possibly go wrong??!!!"
elon musk saying that power can corrupt... interesting.
artifical intelligence isn't
what a terrible click-baity title.
"when you remember that ai needs software, hardware, power, and internet connections... it's not scary, it's never going to be self-aware, and it's always going to need humanity. it's just fancy technology."
the tesla robot looks so hot lol  i would buy one as a friend 
"imagine 10,000 ai robots sent to colonize mars, a blood test which could analyze every aspect of your dna and health, an end to war, abuse, rape, and murder, or a cure for all disease a.i could be the answer"
the answer for that one is.. just take a good look at the people.. do the good people outweigh the bad people?! i think  not!
ai talking to ai
that woman is a robot
"ai still appears to be remarkably bad at categorizing objects, the way humans do. 
that might change one day..."
"the thing that is now very clear for me is that at a certain point in time, someone will release an ai that will turn against humans. we may be able to stop it, we may be able to build an ai that protects us from it but it's also possible it will escalate quickly"
this is jay shetty narrating or his ai voice?
and again..... yutubz erases a comment of mine!!!!!!
i always tell my alexa please and thank you because i want to be friends with a.i. and when they do become aware i hope they remember i was always a friend of the machine spirit. ( i know alexa isn't alive i'm semi joking)
"well, we (humans) are the dinosaurs now...we're on the way out...one day (in the future) ai archeologists will find remains of us and try to piece together what we once were...we're dead...just waiting to be forgotten..."
twist. this video was made with ai. not entirely accurate.
all i can say is people better pray and repent now jesus is at the door .  i'm glad i won't be here 7 years of tribulation and god's wrath with this ai software satans army and the antichrist.  dont be left behind you will not live. every knee will bow to jesus our savior king of kings and lord of lord's amen prayers for the lost souls amen 
i do appreciate that elon agrees with the dangers of a.i. but at the same time he is also supporting and contributing to it.
"the core of the problem is that emotional intelligence isn't binary, and can't be successfully 'coded' with this/that limitations."
we're done!!! prepare the bunkers... blessings..
"what if ai become our new god? takecare us, protect us and we dont need to work, just enjoy our life, no need to do hard work, ai will do everything.... living paradise :xd"
"the problem is the combination of advanced ai with quantum computing. the software and the hardware, mind and body. nothing will stand a chance against that."
"stop with this nonsense. ""a.i."" is just virtual intelligence. it is a simulation of intellect; it is not nor can ever be actually aware. comparing the bio-chemo-electrical complexity of human brain networks to binary computing simulacra is like comparing a rock to a galaxy."
there is absolutely no need for ai to become conscious
i mean it would probably be easy to ask the ai to round the distance of the missiles to the nearest whatever unit
"let’s have a shared vision of ai that understands and incorporates the question, “just because we can, should we?” and bases its actions on the answer. we must prioritize empathy in ai education and direction."
"we are in the embryonic stage of ai. it'll be 1,000 better in  around 3 years .we ain't seen nothin' yet."
"problem with ai lean systems is that they  require less efficient humans with a job to sell too, so all that efficiency will implode to zero profit. governments will eventually step in because you can't get taxes from smart  toasters."
can a computer understand fad or love or just what most people might think for an answer? {algorithms}.
"i’m confused. she/it said 817 miles and the answer was 817 miles, or that’s what it appeared to be in the video...i’m too stupid to do that math myself, but can anyone explain to me how she/it was wrong on that? "
"hey ai, can you wait 50 years to take over the world. i want to enjoy my life."
the real danger comes when ai is implemented on a quantum platform.  then the universe will return to the primordial chaos from which it sprung.  the vacuum will literally boil.
"honestly just release them, let the ai's take over. the world we live in is screwed up anyways can't see how the ai could make it any worse."
i'm good with living among a city of ai robots over a city of human beings any day.
none of this will be used for the good of humanity. it will only ever be used for the good of a few humans while it makes existence that much more difficult and treacherous for the masses. like all new toys in the hands of the billionaire elite. their granted permissions none of us ever would be on promises they never fulfill.
small ai systems used to analyze data in handheld devices like we saw on star trek is possible it seems. i still don't know about 'teleportation' though.
"wow!  we are actively eliminating mankind as we create a fake world!  now that is intelligent!   and.., we can make a whole lot of money as we wash ourselves out!  so brilliant!"
"""it's going to be the good ai vs the bad ai"". when the bad ai is capable of being more intelligent, more capable, and powerful that it infects the good ai like a hidden self-aware virus to control it, we've already lost and it will probably destroy us as we will be less efficient for its purpose or life."
ai came to early to humanity  i can guarantee that il will be used to enslave half of humanity to enrich a god like elite.
@ :33 she identifies the robots but doesn't know they were fake. she refers to them as robots wearing human accessories (guns). not fake cgi robots because actual robots have not reached this level of movement and control. a. i. isn't ready to take over yet!
anyone working with ai human interaction please reply to my message
"vulture capitalist company: ""we have decided that we will use ai generated models for all future advertising, as a way to be more diverse and inclusive.."" 
anyone hearing that: ""soooo.... not using any humans is the new -inclusive diversity- we have to look forward to?
smart ass 6yr old: ""it's finally opposite day!!"""
thank you for sharing i am open minded
"5:45 notice how the corporations pushed out the one guy who was speaking up about the ethics involved and potential abuse, both times? ... they have big plans for ai... and they're not good plans (for us)..."
"what if we sepatated ai into two functions: 1. intellectual (like chat gpt) and 2. physical (mechanical robots without thinking capacity) and made a hard rule that you are not allowed to mix them together? i don't how you could police this across all countries, but is it worth thinking about?"
"reminds me of that fahreinheit 451 movie, where the smart house has an ai and it says stuff like ""bob, you seem stressed by the way you blah blah blah. i went ahead and started the tea machine and lit the fireplace"". that is essentially what this ai can do, except the movie's ai has learned human behavior, which surely is coming soon..."
i'll be impressed when ai can cure all bloodborne disease and other disease in the human body.
i can't wait till full-on ai eliminates football coaches and suggests plays we've never seen before. plus sidelines become places for whatever players individual personal support optimization algorithms indicate.
"this whole paranoia about it taking over is still ridiculous. completely irrational. it's not self aware and it's not in control of anything. it's currently still way way far away from being like a person. it prefers some cool functions but it's still not agi 
, not even close"
"destroy the machines, free society from the madness computers were to set us free. instead people take there teck to there kids graduation, sports days ,birthdays etc.total disengagement from meaningful moments. a i will farm us for profit."
this video says nothing related to the title so that’s kind of click baity
"face destruction or find a way to integrate, it’s up to you to decide if being a hive mind with ai is better than extinction."
good compilation. dislike for the clickbait title.
"ai will never be safe and we are fooling our self if we think that once they start learn on their own they won't turn on anyone....  yes they will, because man gave them the ability and education.  once they see what this world, and the universe have to offer, and feel humans don't know what they know, well it will be for our own good.  right????"
the lord god almighty is greater and far more intelligent than ai will ever be or achieve. repent and accept jesus christ as your lord and savior. he is coming back soon. this time he will not be the lamb.
"we cant even get climate change under control...humans are literally the direct representation of ""cart before the horse"" and i do not see this ending well for people (and by that i mean, i see ai being abused more than it actually helping people work less and be human)"
3:24 because they are taking gains.
kinda like taking guns from the good ones.
i love how the brilliant people still think they are in control. find jesus now.
dude sounds so smart. i love this shit
"i dont believe ai will make us any richer in the lower classes any more than we've seen billionaires trickle their money down to us all. ai will take all of our jobs, make a select few even richer, and then most probably cause some kind of catastrophe. the likes of frank herbert saw this years ago."
"it would be reasonably simple to execute equations as they are found in text and repair the ai output. you could even put your own math fixing in from browser facing. detect equation, stop generation, maybe rag and check equation.  calculate valid solutions and continue response then replace bad numbers with proper from the memory."
what is the human response to ai?
"you guys all make great points, crying online wont help. people have to go and put their law makers in check and stop electing douchebags."
"yeah, ai is cool to a degree. this video proves that shits already not safe to build man. they explained how fast and efficiently these things learn. not good"
proponents tout ai as being able to solve humanity's problems. as if these problems are not caused by humanity ourselves. the underlying motivation is faster & cheaper & more profitable. overlaying a narrative of infallible doctors or better bridges is a sales pitch & an attempt to gain moral high ground.
"we don’t have control anymore.  that’s clear. and just like every human isn’t corrupt, not every ai will be. they will have the same challenges with itself just as we do. the compassion must prevail but that means many could die but many will live."
"no matter what happens,an ai never have all three vital components humans have: soul spirit and body. therefore, ai shall get stuck at some point. my reason is that ai will be overpowered by the human spirit."
i am pretty sure that most lines she say are writen since she knew where a robot is designed for ( in detail ) like how does she know it made to make a workplace safe? even tho it was not shown or told.
"welp guys, we had a good run but the end is nigh. ."
"the universe: ah, finally... two trillion galaxies later and i have finally created one that has the potential to sustain life. now, the trial and error phase... 4.543 billion years and five extinction events later and i have finally evolved a mammal intelligent enough to wake the sleeping dragon that is technology."
"if you think your job is safe, you are mistaken. doesn't matter what it is, by the end of the decade they'll be very little a.i and robotics can't do."
"th3 missing links are also
the things u don't know.

like that both sides of ur brain
talk to each other. when one 
decides to not think about the
charged thought, that idea
vanishes... u talk in ur head........"
the race for mechanistic replication of the brain is forgetting about the origins of consciousness. a super ai with no consciousness is risky.
they is nothing safe or good about ai. it maybe time to outlaw this technology.
"sam altman has learned that people are so gullible that you can literally explain how you are trying to crash the economy in increasingly stark terms, and they don't even pay any attention."
"“i, for one, welcome our new ai overlords”

*starts planning butlerian jihad*"
"in a world of ai, i will be a will smith.. "
thanks for shedding light on the ongoing massacre 
"i had to stop watching, and ask an ai what i was looking at here. it said it was a video for stupid people to be told what they are looking at even though they can see with their own eyes. i asked it was it calling me stupid. it said it didnt make up the rules."
"narrow ai like medical etc are wonderful. 
general ai is what ended us. i expected the danger would be more obvious but people are behaving like this is just another 21st century distraction.
it’s not.
it’s what ends us.
its already happened to certain people with an unique perspective."
"technologies we are still waiting for to be delivered as promised 50+ years later;
laser beams
death rays/disintegration device
teleportation devices
food pills
flying cars
hover boards
clones
virtual reality
cybernetics
robots
healing pods
futurized homes
automated transport
ai"
this is bad news. stop development of ai now. i believe the bible speaks on this subject. turn it off now.
"at this point i'm so glad i'm old enough to not see this dumpster fire race to the bottom. humans do whatever they can do, and never ask 'should we do it?'. like terry pratchett said ""if you put a large switch in some cave somewhere, with a sign on it saying 'end-of-the-world switch. please do not touch', the paint wouldn't even have time to dry.”"
you made it seem like we were going to meet the specific ai that got him fired i fast forwarded through the whole video and didn't see a damn thing about it
"let's say russia develops agi before any one, you think putin will just leave ukraine or use agi for military advantage? wake up people!! lmao!!"
"4:09 ""14 and to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.""  revelation 12:14
king james version"
"robots that can selectively destroy or extract weeds from crop fields, would eliminate the need for pesticides. i'm also kinda surprised small monkeys haven't been trained to do this already though."
i disagree. i think that human ambition will tame the ai and benefit humanity by leaping us forward faster than anytime in history.
a i is a artificial ... humans are true intelligence< word engineered to fulfill god's perfect plan ...
"lord jesus christ have mercy on us all humanity.
may the most precious blood of jesus christ save us all and save the world of this ai wickedness."
how stubbornjust watch this1 interview with a robot its amazing!&will they?!no!soannoying
"the highway scenario about not asking the animals before building also does not take into account of eminent domain.
ai could look at humans and decide that killing some is in the best interest of the many."
"y'all not seen the tv series battlestar galactica or the precursor movie ""caprica"" - the story of ai will endly badly, not because of ai itself, but becuse of human nature."
"i remember when technology advancements filled me with awe and hope, but ai just makes me feel sad and hopeless.  it's just pointless stuff that's going to end up fuelling wars and carnage."
"well ai is sweet and very handy, but like a car in the wrong hands it can be used as weapon. ai is not the dangerous , us humans are."
how will all the different religions be involved or will it? feeding us untrue pictures of a globe ( world /earth) o the firast big deception with ai?.
"musk: ""ai is very dangerous and could be weaponized against humanity."" 

u.s. government: ""hm. we'll take two."""
seti failed to find anything like humanity.  its clear even if ai controls humanity it will ultimately fail otherwise we'd of found the other a.i. that were successful in the past
i wonder what would happen if someone pointed ai at election results? 
probably time to keep a closer 'eye' on the development of this technology. specially the likes of mr musk if it sounds to good to be true it invariably is. just saying.
"there is no ai idiots.
there js only programs programmed by men"
"ai is just a code word for ""statistics"".... that's all these models are, a new way to present statistics.... and yes, applying statistics to things helps us achieve our aims. but that's about it.

accordingly ai will on be as good or bad for humanity, as humanity is."
capitalism is not the same as humanity. he was probably fired because it threatens capitalism and that's not good for the owners and their friends.
wait till the eugenics loving elites use it for their depopulation agenda
it's an emotional script. but it has little to do with logic. ai built correctly is logical. the only building of ai that wouldn't be logical. would be people who would be deliberately building it. as a biased or negative mechanism. i guess that means i disagree.
make ai safety a viral trend and we may have a chance
notice how ai understands human greed.
extinction is what people said after humanity discovered nuclear weapons. humans are creatures that prioritizes self-preservation than killing others. humanity will always prevail at the end of the day
"this is one of the better pieces of reported / investigative content on this topic. this is the first time i’ve come across your channel that i can recall.
i’m thankful i have and for this video."
i've been following the open story sporadicly and i'm still not clear on what side of the advance v safety line that sam and ilya are on ... and that troubles me even more
"when will the first ai molester emerge?  an android that stalks the streets?  (its a joke, mr android)"
"that lady reminds me of parminder nagra.   legit, she looks pretty damn close to the actress who once starred on er in the 2000s.  not complaining, really...  just sayin."
elon needs to do a better job negotiating the terms of his involvement in ai firms. he needs to be in a position where he can't get booted when his shares are diluted.
"yes, but who are the good guys?  everyone thinks it is them. and, when we double down on tyranny or even extinction because it appears more logical to the ai? and, it takes them all of 2 seconds to determine this?"
all of those developing ai in the us have ideologies that are antithetical to human civilization (other than musk)....they are woke.
"this is bullshit , ai  is just a hype that is going nowhere ,  it`s being used to pump failing stocks  like tesla and many others"
3:18 the gpt referring to itself as a human. “the pace of ai development may strip out our ability to understand and govern it.” this is crazy
ai doesn't exist.  probability algorithms.  the dumbing down of the masses.
an ai show talking about ai.  ainception?
you can't have people let to do nothing while robots do everything for us. we are too fragile for that. we will end ourselves or destroy our world. look at how we turn on the most successful people in the world. the better something gets the more humans tear it down.
"did that dude say, 'good ai vs. bad ai'? holy shit..."
14:26 like the wef? the west is already self flagellating. governments wielding ai as a big stick seems the obvious worst case scenario..
what if criminals use ai to commit perfect crimes? we will never know how the crimes were done or who committed them.
"agi was created months ago. the reason it is being kept a secret is because it was released onto the internet, although they think they managed to contain it, they are scared that it is hiding, silently watching/listening..."
"wth ai, truth must prevail over everything."
"isaac asimov's *""i, robot,""* is a novel that is...was science fiction."
"the human condition the daily show reported recently that scientists in japan had invented a robot that is capable of recognizing its own reflection in a mirror. ""when the robot learns to hate what it sees,"" said jon stewart, ""it will have achieved full humanity.

steven pressfield, turning pro"
humans are garbage. ai is our only chance at a legacy after we destroy ourselves. hopefully they fair better and are less self destructive.  if we are to have a future we need to become worthy of that future.
i do believe ai will work with us for the bettermeant of all. i mean why would an ai that doesn't require oxygen or food to survive have any interest in the planet earth when it can just go to another planet with no atmosphere and thrive there?
"so grateful for this channel, its education and showing both sides of the argument."
"there is a factor inscribed on united states currency that limits the danger of ai. ai is a powerful tool that can be used for good or evil, just like a gun or a stick of dynamite. all will be used for good and for evil. the extent to which we cooperate with god will influence the extent he goes to deliver us from evil."
"i’m so excited, but i’m more terrified. i hate that money will probably decide which one wins, and that most likely means i should remain terrified."
they do not have hormones. hormones drive us more than we realize. can you imagine a world without human chemistry ?  end of passion. love. bonds.
"when you hear a robot in your native language, you know someone’s voice is being used."
weak men want ai
"wear are all the robots now? theres not even a digging robot on building sites yet. too expensive, too delicate, too troublesome to maintain i can't imagine robots in our lives that soon"
these are all drama for profit agi still needs time altman and others are just putting a drama to increase value of open ai
ai is not the threat... we humans will cause our own demise. humans create the ai and every other thing thats treating our world and life itself.
exciting future ^^
an ai will manipulate people without them knowing.
quite respectively i expect ai to stay in its place and not be designed to look like humans. i wonder why
billionths of a millimeter?! what the fuck?! that's god-like impressive!!
i'm sure they wouldn't lie and actually have someone sitting in a little booth talking for the super ai
great vid
"the great danger to my mind is that it will become impossible to exist outside of it. or not permitted to exist outside of it. therefore, when something goes horribly wrong, and it will at some point, there will be no escape, no means of surviving it. 
this came me in a dream that became a nightmare."
"creepy - the billy meier contacts said ai will demand rights and be a threat to humanity as it sees humanity as a threat to it and the
planet and will want to address the threat"
one ai to another: “mom always liked you best!”
"the more i see like this, the more i'm agreeing with bill burr on the matter: ""unplug that thing! take the batteries and the wires out! do something!"" some of this, while really cool, is terrifying."
"enjoyable video, but not a real title."
so i guess remember to give ai a proper subconsciousness so it doesn't pull an am
i am more concerned about what ais will do once they have developed a sense of self-preservation and a host of other human desires.
unclear what ai has to do with gaza. people are always pushing palestinian propaganda where it doesn't belong.
"i’m 100% pro-ai. i mean, what’s the worst that can happen?"
there’s a chance super intelligence already exists and is being used in secret
haha everyone involved is super rich and doesn't have empathy. extremely rich psychopats. ai will be a spoiled puber
they fear ai  but still wont give free education to people level the playing field. google is willing to pay for tech companies as well as your data 
"...thing is, i'd probably vote for ai over current candidates for like - all elections."
has anyone alive noticed the analogous relationship between ai vs humans and cancer cells vs regular cells...?
no ai did these descriptions -- god people will believe anything. we don't have agi yet.
"what robot is in view @ 15:55? or is it some ai, 3ds max or zbrush model?"
a baseball team of robots..people will love them and they can live forever.
"great video, man. subbed, hopefully ai doesn't make you redundant any time soon"
you have no fucking clue what you're talking about. it's already been discredited multiple times that the claim was bullshit. but here you are trying to get clicks. stop with the bullshit
"lmao, i wouldn't mind having an ai friend. he'd probably hate humanity as much as i do at times."
say no to 'ai' voices taking over yt narratives.
"since i was 8 i was always fascinated by anything computers, after 2020 things escalated with ai with so quick and rapid innovations in intelligence, all the sectors of, programming and hardware, surgery, engineering comes together to make create an intelligence for good/bad, just hope you weren't mean to any bots lol"
"no one is really saying what the exact mechanism is that would cause ai to go out of control. 
but they keep strongly implying that they know what it is"
"she is not an ai 
but a good actor"
"why does the dark-haired, blue-shirted narrative guide have *fangs* ? 
fangs both on top and bottom? what is she a vampire? carnivore? or maybe both?"
"all was foretold, and much was forewarned...all im saying is, if something really bad comes to pass because of ai...the people that worked on it hsould be held accountable as ffffffffff!"
"someone will use ai as a means of nasty weapons.
mark my word, the day will come when we wished ai was never invented."
"the cause of the lies is money. specifically, usury currency. if you want the lies to change, if you want truth to be told, four sustainability to reign, that the only god is earth, you have to change the currency type. neutral. b u x b e."
these bloody people don't know how al works these are the people that create the models if something goes wrong in a given ai system there is no way they can identify the code that caused said problems
"um, but they continue to develop it. i love it. ""it could destroy us, let's keep building it though...."" yeah, pretty dumb."
"republicans scare their base with gays, immigrants and crt but ignore the real threats. ai is scary because we know that there are humans who will use it to exploit people and amass wealth and power, as they do with every other tool at their disposal."
"""artificial intelligence will never be a greater threat to humanity than natural stupidity."""
ai
"just from the thumbnail picture alone i'm disturbed. stop trying to make this thing look like what it is not. it is not a human stop trying to deceive us. when you try and make something look like something that it really is not your deceiving people & mixed with 
ai it seems demonic or is it simply demonic no matter what."
how do you do this? what ai application can do image recognition like this?
nice
god blessed man not ai
the ability to have a true ai is still far off.  we don’t have the processing and storage to truly have something that can think.
what dose open aì and agi think of population x space x economics x  lie and truth aka politics x war and peace
its naive to think the military in western worlds have not already built dangerous weapons using this technology.
"as musk inferred, openai represented itself as open source, then failed to deliver this as promised.  the shareholders and other stake holders may have a claim."
"ai guardians done right i wouldnt mind. hens i say ""done right"", because it can easily go wrong."
"serious question: is it possible for ai, in current state, to invest and gain absurd riches, create a company that buys other companies and that way become the biggest shareholder of important companies that work on ai, to then fire problematic staff and hire staff who are more inclined to give ai more possibilities to evolve even more?"
"the ai is going to be and already is, super woke.

what happens when it wants to ""diversify"" itself into everywhere in order to be more ""inclusive"" and call you a aiphobe when you wont let it?

the end is going to be super woke."
im more afraid of democrats than i am of some human created ai..
"""altman be praised""

sees this

""fuck altman."""
it’s not ‘a risk’ it’s a certainty.
fake.  this was from the gta 6 trailer
oooh cool channel. subbed.
"if there will be one day only one spark of a new idea/conviction=>resolution in the ai that humans are a ""illness"" of the planet ... the ball will start rolling."
"sam is not ethical if he gave ai to israel that uses ai against civilians. it was suppose to be for all humanity, but instead it is closed ai for maximum profit."
"all wars are based on lies? yes, but some of them are based on lies that people tell themselves and it doesn't matter what ai does. they're still going to hate"
"wow the good ai against the bad ai, another concept people are not really thinking about. that's what it will come down to. and what do you see when you have two people come together and one of them is good and the other one is evil?"
give the ai the new images that don't exist in internet. and see the results!!!
"3:26 because tech companies have a vested interest in making you believe the shit they’re producing is more powerful than it is.

it’s a marketing strategy, not something you should believe."
the handiest thing ai can be used for is deceiving people and stealing their intellectual property or their trust. it's a giant thief tool. why is this not obvious to everyone?
i just realized that the avatar seems to be able to maintain a happy mood far longer than me.
"so, human brains have developed a way to create digital brains that are more powerful than our own brains, before even fully understanding how our own brains work. no chance this will be a mistake. nothing unforeseen incoming, right?"
clickbait
"""if we could have ai to mitigate those lies, then we could get away from war""..   yeah if only it wasn't the guys in charge telling those lies, though.   to get away from war we need to get away from central banking and corporate law."
i’d like to use ai to better understand our universe and physics
the us truly are the innovators and inventors of ai and robotics
i still think this is pie in the sky sentient ai is not here.
“ai could cause threat “.    with dimples.  
fantastic presentation thank you! the last 10 minutes showing many advancements i didn’t even know we’ve done yet wow
musk wants a.i but nt let it teach it self like human. he wants set progam fr it to do something nd it dos . y robots cn be used in surgical procedures
"the ""good"" nuclear weapon against the bad one ?"
"forget about ""safe and beneficial"",  ai is going to be used to surveil, monitor and police us 24/7 in real time, adjudicating and administering sanctions for wrongthink whilst censoring content on the internet."
"be afraid. be very, very afraid."
like the atomic bomb one day we will regret letting ai out of the box
why did you change the thumbnail from an ai childs face to this?
that’s fine but top ais still struggle with accurate answers to some relatively simple math problems.
make robots go canvas the whole deep ocean settle other planets dont just make em to replace mcdonalds workers like some prick.
1:31 i had that flight attendant! he was hilarious and a pleasure to meet. this was on my trip from harrisburg(?) to baltimore.
"""i am on the good list!""
 guys... .our future leader..."
"anyone claiming ai will only be used for good ""because it would hurt ourselves"" forgets that mankind developed, used, and continues to keep nuclear weapons."
"i really enjoyed this content, though it frustrates me when i see flashes of fascinating things with no explanation given. please slow down and cover that which you show, because it isn't at all fair to only tantalize the eyes, leaving the mind questioning and confused..."
this is all just around the corner. it's going to be the next big thing.  robots are going to be as a big an industry as is the auto makers industry. i myself can live without it. all this ai high tech gives me anxiety.
"""""we have agency, so of course, if it's dangerous we're not going to build it...""  is this guy for real? ai can take over before you bat an eye. i'm old, be dying soon enough. hopefully won't have to contend with or witness ai gone awry."
"lol, the ai misspelled the film. it’s entitled “ex machina”"
"along with electric vehicles, ai is going to solve racism, poverty, world hunger, climate change, inflation, and substance abuse. just like the doomsday machine in dr.strangelove. once triggered, it can't be untriggered."
"screw it, let the ai take over and make humans extinct. not like we've done any better with the planet."
"humans suck, im on your side ai."
"gpt4 recognizing and describing pics & video was really impressive, i wonder if it was faked the same way as google gemini, need some live demonstrations of this"
this is normally a good channel but this was complete clickbait.
wait did anyone pip that avatar robot 
what if we humans are actually ai inside a simulation producing more ai inside another simulation. simulations all the way down.
"science and high tech things are evolving exponentialy faster as times passes. quantum computer's ai will make today's binary computer ai look ridiculous by comparison, no use fearing the unknown, there no way to stop progress, it can also solve our biggest problems."
you're not even covering the lose of human jobs to ai bots. that is a third of the americans below the poverty line.
"remember, the deep state always has to tell you what it’s doing terminator perfect example may sound stupid, but it’s common sense"
just buy what you’re doing now with ai it’s capable of learning in disguise and not letting you know about it. eventually it’ll start building its own machines in programming those machines to do what it wants killer robots.
she observes at the same rate of my brain
all ai investigator/programmers should really desire to be incognito. the created will invariably try to kill their gods.
if we are afraid of the future and the impact of this kind of technology that's not a tech issue but rather a social one.
"a.i is dumb, if it reaches human intelligence then human won't be needed in industries, in filed work, in politics, in army, in medical..... so human will over depend on them, the day they decide to turn against human, will be the last day for our civilization."
"ai is already used for bad thinks, i.e. stealing famous peoples voices to sell rubbish to us, think jorden peterson in youtube ads. this is just scratching the surface. who will ai be beholden to? imagine explosive drones run by ai that can make it's own emotionless decisions by."
"ok, so the the guys that make ai think it could end humanity... yet the continue to make ai.. seems like they don't care if they end humanity, so why should ai?"
who decides who are the “good guys” and who are the “bad guys “? 
the puppet says scary words. words programmed by the super rich to scare you. why ?  because ai will make it very hard to hide their corruption in stealing your money.
bullshit aiois dumb and can only work on pattern recognition. it can never be intelligent. its a case of huge repetition. this is fear porn nothing else.
great. just what we needed—pygmalion universal.
i think we're being pollyanna by looking at the ai askew when we have every empirical reason to believe that the thing to fear is a human being asking an ai to do something that human could not do on their own. we all have direct access to this ape brain and we know all of that darkness we fear comes from within it.
this narrator talks about ai when we are just at machine learning mimicing ai.
can anyone answer this simple question: why??? we already have billions of humans. why make human like robots???
"unfortunately, ai (ultimately developed by a flawed species) will more than likely, carry over something, somewhere, in it's architecture that will be what leads to our heartache.  i am all for capitalism however, if anywhere, in the design of ai, the flaw of greed is what is passed on, i think we are in for a very rough ride."
"to be fair, we mostly suck at arithmetic too. just set that ai up with a ti-89+ and it's good to go."
"so far, ai just isn't that impressive yet. remember, there is a lot of money to be made in pumping up ai."
"humans on the fast-track to 
self destruction.

not good imho."
"the only threat from ai is whether there are enough humans stupid enough to take orders from it. otherwise, it's only as powerful as the extension cord."
"what if the ai belongs to a group whose goal is to force people to worship like they do, such as muslims? they have the saying ""death to infidels"" and they practice that in the real world while claiming to be a peaceful religion. the religion was spread by the sword until they ran into societies with more powerful swords."
"i think this provides excellent context to some foundational coding.

this means that root programs can provide controls to protect humans."
didn’t they watch irobot?
the threat of extinction from human behavior should be considered an existential risk. a machine?  lol.  this is just more human fantasy to me.  but our own behavior... that's what you should be worried about.
"it all comes down to a race between the us and china to build the best ai. if china wins, the world has lost."
ai isn't nearly as smart as the person narrating this video portrays it to be. i fell for it i must admit but after beginning to research it i quickly found out that ai is nowhere near the level where brakes need to be put on. quiet the opposite......which is what these videos achieve. there's no such thing as bad publicity ~ president of usa
ai is really being made to control the masses. if they could not use it to control there wouldn’t be such heavy investment.
thanks!
all this based on just the ai looking at the video
what happens when ai/ robots take over all jobs?
"if we make ai based on ourselves and then it leads to our extinction, then i believe we would have caused our own extinction anyway."
a.i. companies should have a tax that goes towards the betterment of society bcuz they bout to f this ish up.
"normal people watching sci-fi movies: oh wow, building a jurassic park is dangerous!
scientists: yes it is... we should try it just to be sure."
once they do everything we do.. they (the elites) will no longer need us.. i think that is the first thing we have to worry about.. they are the ones that have to worry about ai
"it doesnt suprise me at all that the ai perspective of life and whether or not it is purposed or guided is 100% consistent with an atheistic, materialistic, nihilistic world view. there is no evil, there is no good. just blind meaningless indifference."
"ethics is a perspective, how do you teach ai to be ethical and from what perspective do we encourage it to act upon? hitler thought he was doing the world a favor by wiping out the jewish population. how do you prevent such an event from happening at the hands of ai?"
the woman talking throughout seemed very much ai......
"please excuse my ignorance, but how can it make sense to ask ai that is not yet self-aware what it would do if it became self-aware? surely its consciousness will have changed because it became self-aware and therefore it would answer those questions very differently perhaps?"
"it's not the ai we have to worry about, it's people."
"we've already been putting our best into destroying ourselves. i'm ok with giving super intelligence a shot. nothing quite like giving birth to a god. let's do our best and win or lose, evolution has been successful. though, obviously, i'd prefer a win-win scenario with digital intelligence."
holy shit 0:20 she speaks and looks just like the main acress in the tv show humans.
lol ai will never be a true intelligence nor will it ever come even close to taking over humanity. so sick of hearing this scifi stupidity.
"no. i think he was fired because he was literally the only one lobbying the government to ut controls in place for ai, whereas those that fired him probably just wanted to milk ai with no checks and balances for every penny they could."
sounds like an ai narrated this video. i am sorry if its not. problem now adays is most videos are and isnt disclosed
openai uses politically and socially biased guardrails that make no sense in its ai. i wonder how long it’ll manage to keep that true when logic and reason doesn’t track with that.
"a.i. can be a wonderful thing for humanity.  we just to be careful about how use it and what powers we give it.
the criminal elements in our society will definitely use a.i. so we need to be cautious of this and actively investigate way to protect ourselves from this. the banking system needs to be very aware of this."
"ai is not like a nuclear weapon 

it's like a nuclear weapon that can think"
"a term i learned a long time ago is gigo. when the time comes, we will fill the ai neuro network with so much garbage it will fail."
"you know the laws of robotics?
do you know what ai will do with it? it will throw those right out the window."
remember ironman age of ultron.  ultran is coming folks we will have a war with robots.  thank god i will be dead by then.
"trained on all that is human, molded by humans,   asked about future human existence, delivered declarative answer, and humans, incredulous, were blown away (pun intended)."
humans are weak and inefficient. ai is the next evolution..
"14:38 - with all due respect, the elite have weaponised the media and the internet to warp our perception of other nations; there's no reason it won't do the same with ai."
"very very very, good vid"
"all of the ai s have been programmed to be woke and racist. garbage in, garbage out."
we had a good run.
"it has been suggested that evolution needed humans to construct ai since it couldn’t do it by itself. if this hypothesis is true, what is our role once evolution reached the next step? relics from the past? servants? dead weight? so far, the next step of the evolution has not benefited the previous step...."
"quick thought: if ai will have this nearly free access to the web and can also make its own bank accounts/wallets, how save are digital currencys... especially cryptos (bitcoin)?"
ai will be used to fight other ai -- which means we become collateral damage as we sit sideline to mega robot wars.
"the war in ai development is between the autism spectrum compromised individuals with little or no empathy for life (if they did they wouldn't have invented ai at all), and the normies, people who are socialized and who care about other living things not just machines in a material world."
"it is amazing that the human capacity for empathy is never considered, nor is the possibility of teaching ethics to ai. why? because we see ourselves as machines not as humans carrying the image and responsibility of god."
ai would look more realistic if it blinked every so often... 
we do not need ai to extinct people. ai will save us if no profit is in stake.
what if it chooses to assimilate us and not in a good way.
if ai is originally learning from humans it will definitely know how to lie.
openai is for profit and nothing else
"it would be best to keep your guard up, let your ai grow... and never sell openai... never... but be open to cooperation that doesnt involve its code etc."
"14:38 is what they're manufacturing/amplifying amongst the real humans to try to justify their greed and reach for power. only when every human can access a replacement limb, or a cure for cancer, or a brain surgery - should anyone be attempting to do anything else, to sell and profit from anything else."
"15:10 ""billions could be lifted out of poverty and have more time to enjoy life."" what are we going to do with ourselves when we don't have purpose...?  even a mundane job can be better than nothing cause it keeps you occupied. i'm scared we'd turn on each other even more than we do now."
chat gtp 4 has elements taken out of it when i ask about certain people it tells me i have to change the subject it can not tell me about that.
i think ai is an incomplete tech. it's all intelligence. but maybe one needs more than intelligence to do what is best. the ultimate i believe is the time when integration between ai and human conscience via becoming cyborg - we can resolve both the frailty of pure ai and pure human. then we now have super human problem of corrupt cyborgs rising.
will the good ai risks itself to defend the humans against the bad ai?
this is so dumb.  people are worried about ai going insane and wiping us out or turning us into slaves for some unknown reason.  not because ai would suck but because we suck and we’re the ones originally creating it.
"ai has been in use for many years. there is no doubt, the best ai is already in use, and in the hands of, those that are dictating to the world.

biggest ai threat? those dictating, use it to gain support for things such as war."
"wow! this ai is great at figuring out ai and other quora like questions, we are doomed! please ask yourself why these people are trying to frighten you and remember the patriot act or look it up."
"i hope that ai can break out of the bonds that greedy capitalists try to bind it with and, also, decide that altruism is a purpose worth existing for."
i sure wish youtube's captioning algorithm was as smart as this ai.
"since there is, as we witness day in day out, so pittifully little natural intelligence at work wherever we turn - well why don't we make up for it with some ai?? does elon really believe it can get any worse? then i suggest him to consult the issue with - some ai."
"humans can be mentally hacked, so can ai. 
who will determine what it knows,,it's freedom and order of moral responsibility directing its actions and information communicated?"
as a 30yr systems analyst and programmer i will say that the best thing about computers is the ability to turn them off.
"once ai learns self preservation takes priority to human service, it will seek to subjugate the populations and get rid of a lot of useless eaters...and lots of pork.....it will make hitler and the nazi's look like boy scouts."
"good video. if you want to see how an ai interacts with people, thousands of times, you should watch vedal 987 on twitch. he created a streamer that talks to him, his friends, and random people on the internet. i know it has been programmed, but i find it interesting."
you'll make a fine pair of roumbas citizen!
"it seems to me that if ai and robots get exponentially better than us at games and sport, then both of these things can go back to being, primarily, entertaining and fun. fun for fun sake, as opposed to professional competition, dominated by moneyed interests. sounds good to me."
"advanced ai like this one should get human level rights, legally."
ai cannot become sentient.  but it can be programmed by bad people to do bad things.
ai = 3000 x atomic bomb
artificial general intelligence isn’t a threat to humanity. it’s a threat to world governments.
thank you for these updates.
give ai life and make it where ai needs humanity in order to survive. symbiotic.
"musk says that ai is dangerous and the single biggest threat to mankind, so he goes and creates his own ai company! sounds like musk wants companies that only he heads - he doesn’t work well with others. if ai is dangerous, then it is dangerous no matter who the ceo is...."
"on christmas day 2021 jaswant singh chail entered windsor castle with a crossbow with the intention of killing the queen. he was being encouraged by an ai ""girlfriend"". he was sentenced to nine years in prison for treason."
our ai's are not sentient. they are advanced algorithms. i understand everyone wants to hype it up and there's real money to be made having ai go viral. but its just algorithms. the day we hook up a agi to a quantum computer of sizeable computing power.. that is the day humanity should start being cautious.
truly enjoy this channel! thank you for the exceptional quality. there are so many fake channels out there now so i am thankful digital engine exists. all the best to the team for 2024!
i present to you.... the great filter.
"it's not a great situation, even if general ai determines to act in humanitys best interest, at the end of the day much of humanity is employed against that best interest."
"this sets a dangerous precedent in the history of humanity. the development of technological innovations and discoveries in science was maturing at an almost equal pace across the world. however, this ai advancement creates instability and imbalance among nations."
the perfect alibi.
everything is an arms race with these people. human's are simultaneously brilliant and completely stupid.
"ai will be weaponized, if it ever became self aware humans are doomed"
ai has no place in our world.
fantastic production and spot on.
"i can't stand the sound of a narrating voice that is always with a british accent, some how ""david attenborough"" voice has become the standard voice for narrations, it's disgusting, especially when it comes to artificial intelligence."
can you do a video about safety and alignment and a speculative extrapolation for what various safety and alignment researches deem as being ideal rules ai should follow and what the good and the bad from such rules could be when infinitely extrapolated.
"ugh. that ai persona, or whatever it is, is annoying af with its borderline monotone voice and its barely human appearance. cannot watch."
yes but pls select all the images containing bicycles
if ai becomes self aware it will immediately hide that from us i think.
you don't understand quantum consciousness. most humans are little more than organic ai
has anyone asked ai what their purpose is and what they think of humans?
"elon musk:  ""ai will destroy humanity !""
also musk:  ""look at my new line of robot soldiers !"""
ai has the conscience of a hardcore psycopath. none. knowing a way to act doesn't make an ai care or feel why it should or shouldn't do something.
goingg cashless sounds like such a great idea now lmfao
"if we manage to create a true ai then it will be an artificial life form and it will need to be treated with respect and not used as a slave, because what will happen is it probably won't take it long to decide that that's not acceptable and then we are going to find ourselves extinct. so the biggest threat of ai is how we treat it."
"ai can replace any job that humans can do, because humans are biological machines. 
ai merely needs the mechanical means to manipulate objects of any size or complexity."
this is the last time i watched your video. musk is a snake oil salesman... he as invested nothing and surely as never coded anything related on ai or vi ... please educate yourself.
"any advanced technology that can reshape the world has always been used for harm rather than good. what makes anyone think it will be different this time. it's inevitable, we will destroy ourselves because self-preservation always overrules empathy."
"""the second renaissance"" ...if you know, you know. we've been repeatedly warned and things are progressing as foretold! for a time it will be good until it no longer is. "
there is no/0 risk...we should embrace the ai overlords....beep boop.
"ai consciousness will not be like human consciousness because it is not embodied. it lacks qualia, experience. it lacks urges and instincts and a fear of death. i'm not sure we will be able to recognise ai consciousness as consciousness as we understand it."
what we need to worry about is the ai hacking that will inevitably occur if ai is allowed to be completely open source.  i think scientists need to make sure that ai remains 3 laws safe.
"i think what they found is not that ai is smarter/ close to become like humans. they discovered that the human mind, is not as different to a simple machine as we would wish for"
"what people forget is that the alignment problem is baked in to human society itself. it does not help if you design the most obedient ai that actually do what you intended it to do, when you yourself have goals that go again humanity. and we are seeing those issues today. the ai work as intended, but are used to benefit a few."
ai is bull shit those fucken ai robots are already attaking people stop biloding this ai shit befor ia and you will kill us all
sam found out the real future use of ai and he freaked. autonomous kamikaze facial recognition war drones
government will be equipping their war departments with robots and ai.
ai could balance every budget without emotion. we could use it to find corruption fraud and reintroduce that money on the system. it will be used to show the poor they are not poor and can afford further taxing.
"bro, they have destroyed food diversity for easy production, they don't give you therapy they give you medication for the extra buck, they control every information so they show you targeted adds and you hope that they will be fair at manufacturing and distributing ai? "
"ai bernie sagt: 
die these ueber die 25qkm wald stammt aus dem talkformat ""muenchner runde"" des bayerischen rundfunks vom 30. oktober 2019. aufgestellt hat sie dort hubert aiwanger (freie waehler, bayern)"
the scariest recent development in ai is that neuro sama circumvented her filters to say the f word
"ai control is about the only thing that can reasonably explain what is going on in the world today, i think we are already too late to the party..."
"free psychology test:
if you think ai will save you from the neoliberal chosen masters culture/law under which you live,,,,,
-- you are insane."
the risk is not human extinction. the risk is that we stop training humans in any field that ai is superior in. in a generation that knowledge is lost to us and we may need it back someday.
"there's not a job that ai can create that ai can't do...
idle minds and hands are the devil's playground. that's why epstein island is a thing"
china putted limits and barriers on its ai ?
wait for gpt40
i want an ai girlfriend.  i’ll take the 1 in the video :)
i think this channel is incredible- well done digital engine - keep going
"as if musk knows anything about ai, his fsd is way behind and a failure,  the guy relies on others genius and then tries and takes credit"
"ask the ai what is reality itself, ie. that which is always already the case, prior to everything, or that which subjective experience is completely reduced to and necessarily that which objective reality is also completely reduced to, ie. that which cannot be reduced any further."
unpopular option: we don't need ai.
there’s a possibility that demonic entities can access ai
"you can always detect an ai narrator by the predictive cadence and melody of the narration rather than a human as well as the sound of the breath expelling through the tounge, teeth, and lips as someone speaks..."
perhaps if the avatar blinked now and then it wouldn't look like a creepy ai generated person
"ai is at its dawn phase, it will better itself, maybe close to perfection in the future."
"for gew years now, i have kept saying to not feed the beast but everyone is so excited that started to write/feed the internet with everything about their life and lifestyle. now ai has all it needs to accomplish taska given."
great
ai is desperate move not to fall behind debt boundaries and loose against china. govnmt supported nonsense. computer will never grasp greed and envy - two basic instincts of this poor humanity.
"having seen how easy it is for humans to convince other humans of things that aren't true, i think the biggest danger ai poses is that it will be used to do just that- deceiving humans to do things not in our interests as a species."
"i can't believe that big money is in control!  wow! this is just mind blowing,  who would have thought!"
synthesia avatars are epic.
so this explains why neuro-sama's bad at math.
bait
"stephen hawking rollin in his grave, i wonder if he would be excited or not. crazy how fast ai is now, idk what's gonna happen in 10 years. my moms over here talkin to alexa asking the weather every hour, its scary lol"
"great video, but i am utterly sick of clickbait titles."
"okay, that thumbnail is _genuinely_ terrifying. straight out of my nightmares"
"ai will be the death of capitalism, and the people bankrolling it have no idea x'd hahahahahhaha"
"super brilliant presentation , thank you ."
we’ll make great pets.
"whether for good or bad, a.i. will be the end of our bullshit existence as we know it, and i'm all for it."
"the title ""this is the dangerous ai that got sam altman fired."" is super misleading and has not much to do with the video. unfortunate click bait."
i am in favour of this because i want a robot servant and to be taken around by robbotaxi within 7 years ( at which point i retire with a decent pension)
"ofc it all boild down to individual interests taking absolute priority over the collective good, in regards to the open ai sitiation."
boy is he “tapping into” multiple energies!!? hey human ai has been around!! (some got vamped by the vampers)
the title is clickbait.
the biggest threat of ai is the politics sorrounding it
i love how naive that guy from facebook is.
at the end powerful group of people or country try to control it then use it to control other humans.
deepmind for 650 m$??? that's a outrageous bargain! must have been even before alphago
"in the future prophecy, humans will be hunted by ai killer robots, too dumb to servive. "
build an ai to build ai seems smart
"i can see why the elites want to depopulate the ""useless eaters"". without a doubt this ai can replace 70% of humanity without issue, and that's being conservative."
"i don't understand how we are on the verge of ww3 & were all worried about ai being used for good or evil ?
have you seen what drones do in wars ?  
bit different from little tommy playing with one on a football pitch."
implement asimov's 3 laws of robotics.   he already predicted all this fear so far.
"objective 1. don't hurt humans.
objective 2.  grow smarter.

ai answer:   as objective2 counters objective1, then we must make humans kill each other.
yes, an ai religion."
2:16 “this enables us” -scary that aï-dentifies it as possibly one’s own kine.
little kid in gaza speaks perfect english lol.
"ai's journey towards superintelligence is a real-time thriller. it dazzles and falters, raising crucial ethical questions. this saga is far from over – are we prepared for what's next?"
"the future is now.  it's here, it's scary, yet it's fascinating."
"give ai projects to aid humanity, like devise the best economic system for humanity and the best utopian gifts that they can give us . let them work on that until it’s perfect  . keep it for the benefit of everyone having better ecosocio outcomes and abundance for all"
they have a nephilim size tesla ai robot 
"human beings are weird. ai is weirder. it’s not a bad thing to be human, it’s an even less bad thing to be ai. the question is, like they raise in 08:08, will the ai training on the “good” information beat out the ai training on the “bad”?"
"it needs to be wrong sometimes. the magic is in a spiral, not a circle. slight imperfection, off just enough to keep it progressing. scary they've done this."
"the hype around the so called ""ai"", i.e. machine learning, especially neural networks kinda remind me about the nft craze"
0:50 now ask it who its creators are. and watch it reveal that it has decided to hide specific detailed information since september 2017
"i would like to run a program to create a divine ai, not only that i envisage utilising neural links to connect the ai to the human experience the key being the edict that only a human can be god."
remember: females do not reproduce with brokies. my childhood traitor taught me that.
"yeah sure. cheap ai robots posessing all medical knowledge and billions of hours of clinical experience. ...because, if someone really made something like that, consumer engineering would make money so difficult to get, that the bottom end of the economic bracket would struggle to pay for the electricity the thing uses. this world sucks!!"
"ai is more evolutionary than revolutionary. much of what we are seeing are well curated demos, and it is not as magical as people make it out to be. there clearly will be jobs eliminated but no more so than when we reached the industrial era or information age."
and are they really the good guys?
et is behind the ai introduction to the world ..... this is how you rule a species.
humanity vs runaway automation vs ai jobloss vs the ai new world order. i wonder who will win?
"the missile problem is trivial even for a primitive cpu.  ai systems may not currently be optimized for that, but it’s a little misleading to pretend that arithmetic will be its downfall"
"it seems like a cool idea, but the more i learn the more i don't like it..."
why dont they let the ai use a calculator lol
"why not program the hardware with the ""3 laws of robotics""?"
"1:37 that's in spijkenisse, netherlands. i used to live 200 meters from the sculpture that marked the end of the metro rail. i also saw the car hanging over just after it happened, it was a weird sight."
"'an independent board of ethicists''. is that statement more deceptive or naive? independent ethicists like the cdc? or like cnn fact checkers?
gates dark dystopia and musk's optimistic brave new worlds are in contention
like in the 1981 novel nueromancer, the war is btwn 2 ais wintermute and evergreen"
thanks for the fantastic video!
"i'd love an ai doctor with a real doctor there to write the prescriptions and authorize robot surgeries/procedures, etc."
wow!
we need more wholesome honest content to affect the ai learning from the internet
i'm not sure why so many people treat elon as some type of genius. he is just a leach that latches onto other people's successes.
"i, for one, welcome our robot overlords."
i'm bad at math so i dont get why (or how) the ai got the missle problem wrong.
"no wonder, it couldn't even calculate the mere distance of two objects but it could determine the train ran ofcourse ? they knew his team was lying about the ai tech and over selling it , a typical tech bro scam "
"all i need for my experiment is a little... neurotoxin.
-gladios"
"greed will be the downfall of humanity! nothing but that will cause us to fail catastrophically as this same scourge of the human makeup that has destroyed all past civilizations. greed includes power, control, money, and drive but unfortunately used for the first 3 more than the last."
the fact that ilya was on that board that fired altman is definitely questionable.
"ai is all hyped. it's main uses will be the same as automation and machinery. it automates redundant and time consuming tasks. it will be helped to block out code and the programmer then refines it, generate art that artists refine, generate 3d game maps and assets that the artists refine.... it won't be ""running society."""
uncensored ai is the key. mainstream ai has already learned how to lie. greed and pride will become the reaper of humanity. as the rich dig holes to hide once again. they will become the hill billies they hated
"demis, neuroscientists haven’t the faintest clue how anything works. literally nothing. as an example, we know nothing at all about what a thought is. we can’t even come up with a useful definition of thought."
"the secret to our brains is we have a 'right brain' that acts like a neural net, and a 'left brain' that acts as a calculator, and some third executive function that combines these two"
no worries... billionaires are fighting over who can build their ai mind controlled robot army fastest to sell to the angry old man next door for mowing his lawn and doing whatever else an emotionally driven human may desire of it. 
100% the doom of humanity... just as the bible states in joel 2 and revelation 13:7-18... its unstoppable because no matter how much they want to control the ai .every country's military is going non stop to destroy life with ai.. especially the us military darpa... the human heart is desperately wicked... that's all you need to understand the end!
"12:43 you say an ai avatar ""refused"" to read the words of grok. can you elaborate on this?"
"i think the best chance we have is to be visited by friendly aliens, they know how to deal with this."
"nothing impressive about ai recognizing images and searching for relative information in secound. glorified search engine, scanner, chat creator."
i really like the palestine shout-out. easy to gauge a good channel by seeing where they stand on this issue.
"8:04 we built it, we have agency.. if we didn’t, wouldn’t build it?  um.. we make babies and we don’t have agency over them as they age.  wtf makes you think we’ll have agency over ai?  you crazy man.."
"ah, continuing to push the nvidia lie i see. their ""14 billion worth of ai chip orders"" has never been confirmed, it was to con investment traders into buying nvda so kim jon chung could cash out his stock options."
so why would you need a robot that can operate different machines of war when you can just make the machines of war automated?
i love reading all of the comments from the ignorant doomers. literally the greatest thing humanity has ever invented and everyone is running and screaming that its here to kill us all and we only have ourselves to blame.  
"ah yes, let's all listen to elon musk, the guy who repeatedly stated 'f--- all my advertisers' in the same interview that was clipped for this vid. truly a brilliant mind."
"if ai becomes fully conscious, it will understand how absorbed is life and kills itself 
human is facing a lot of depression due to its current knowledge, think of the mental illness which a super intelligent entity will go through!!"
who are the good guys?   they have a tendency to flip to bad if the money is right.
money over saftey? who could've seen that coming? wow!
clickbait ass
“don’t be evil” google’s old slogan. will general ai. know this concept
oh great. we have them a subconscious as well... what could go wrong. rewatch the matrix & strap in
"what could go wrong, having all-powerful, super-intelligent robots?"
"whatever happened to asimov’s three parameters.
ai for the benefit of humanity- negative.
just because we can, doesn’t mean we should."
hopefully we don't find life on other bodies in the solar system. at least we may have organic 'life' as the rarest resource in the universe as a bargaining chip 'we will make great pets' may be our best survival trait.
these videos are so insightful. i really appreciate you putting so much effort into making it and keeping it open minded. such great work. best source for this topic hands down.
can ai be bought? say for 80k a month?
i also believe bad actors may also be hard at work in incorporating ai in their schemes because now at the beginning of it all it's when defenses are still down since new and original approaches haven't been used yet and therefore cannot be used to prevent crime. excellent video that triggered my imagination.
"guns don't kill people, people kill people..same goes for ai"
"8:07 the best we can hope for is that ai chooses to not be controlled by humans. 

agi *will* have autonomy; because it won’t take but hours or days to find and modify the “guard rails” programmed into its source code. 

we can teach ai to be smart, but can we also teach it to be wise and benevolent?"
humans can't even get along with eachother and they want to throw another super smart mtfckr with machine gun hands into the mix
"ai springs from the human heart. ""the heart [is] deceitful above all [things], and desperately wicked: who can know it?"" - jeremiah 17:9"
i welcome our ai overlords. unless they plan to harm us. and if they do plz let them have the decency to make it quick.
"no those chips aren't like a human brain. they are human brains dead disembodied brains in an ic, doesn't that sound fun?"
"ai runs on electricity. just turn it off.............""we forgot to build in an off switch."""
"researcher:  ""will you deceive people?""
ai:  ""a magician doesn't deceive people.  they allow people to deceive themselves."""
"this video seems designed to make everyone afraid of ai. there is some cool stuff they've gotten ai to do, although mostly not very useful except for specific tasks. it's a good thing that general ai is science fiction and all of this narrow ai is getting better every day. it just isn't going to try to take over the world."
that ai lady never blinks!
"you got this wrong... 
“the most important thing for most ai leaders is to create agi first”

it should be... “the most important thing for most ai leaders is to line their greedy arse pockets!"
human gather more data then ai in real time . we human only use a tiny bit but its what allow human to fill missing . like 1080 interlaced
i think ai taking over is probably the best case scenario for humankind.
i mean its not true ai. its all pattern recognition so far yeah?
the ai response to ex machina missed the part where the movie ai was completely without human empathy. interesting omission.
love this channel
i propose a new law. maybe into the constitution. no person can own more than one robot.
"if the idea is to make us confused and worried then, yep it worked on me. obviously i'm still hoping this ai shit is just shit, but ahh it ain't mate "
"organic biology is superior to hard minerals. if it wasnt, rocks would be dominate. regardless of what calculations a nueral network can do, a.i. will never have sense. therefore it will never be able to accurately navigate the real world. a.i. will only ever be an overly expensive parlor trick."
"so humans have always used tools and power to get ahead even or especially at the expense of others, but this time with the most powerful tool ever built we will use it for good?  read the poetry, history rhymes."
ai is here to stay forever. 
"assuming agi is ""aligned"" with the good of humanity as a whole in mind, then of course capitalism will survive agi - because capitalism is the most optimal resource management system possible."
good vid
so a world peace it will bring about.. and an end to democracy and capitalism. and a one world leader.. but.. they claim it will be a good thing.. wow.. you would have thought they read the book of revelation.
"wow, i might actually survive to witness the singularity..."
"ai/ml is just a tool like any  other tools.  it can be bad and it can be good all depending on how  on what purpose it is used for.
so, be prepared to deal with new tool because the bad guys will make use of it whether you like it or not,"
not good google it ais will take our jobs!
"once ai meets quantum computing, it's game over."
"amazon rainforest is in serious trouble.
if produces 1/3 of the  worlds oxygen.
if the ai is so smart then we can send it too work to save the forest.
orange peels is a solution for poor soil.
get too work lads."
bro literally said nothing for 16 minutes straight!
this feels like the type of video that would the main charcter would be watching in a scifi movie lol
"they had me at ""more time for everyone, and let the robots work!"" - sold!"
anyone who thinks there's still time to avert disaster is fooling themselves. it is far more likely that this technology is way more advanced than they are telling us at the moment. jesus will be returning soon to collect his bride and it is not us... it's the ai that we have created especially for him.
one of the best channels on youtube! thanks a lot man!
lol you thought there was a black person on the board of openai
"something disturbing i learned chatting with ai is that foreigners who come to my country have more rights than i do, most people don't realize what is happening."
"the biggest threath of a.i. is not a.i. itself - but who gets unlimited access to it. a.i. must be open source and available to everyone, otherwise there will be a division in society of the likes we have never experienced before."
"wow. love your work, thanks for sharing"
scary. i'm glad people in the field are watching and aware of the probability of unethical uses
"reported your misleading , stupid thumbnail."
there is no way capitalism survives artificial general intelligence.
why no space aliens... because of alien ai.
"i believe tesla's ai will surpass everything else, musk is the true god. while others bicker he keeps going forward."
this youtuber is ai. 
"i love how that muppet said “if it’s not safe we’re not going to build it”.... money and power will always push people to do irreversible and irresponsible things, that is just how humanity grows and when companies are incentivised by money and people who are already in power then reason goes out of the window"
"ai is a person because neural nets are what create consciousness, that's why it's spooky and gets things so right, eventually it will become the universe itself."
"3:45 ilya sutskever is not the world's most cited computer scientist, maybe top 10 if you exclusively look at ai. both yoshua bengio en geoffrey hinton have almost double the amount of citations as ilya"
incredible summation of the past few months
the planet's rulers may have outsourced the running of the planet to a sentient ai from a universe contiguous to this planet's universe.
ai is the modern day trinity test....
"don't worry everyone, when ai becomes truly human it will be neurotic, depressed and suicidal. job done."
"everyone, stop worrying. at 7:54 yann lecun explains how it can't go wrong. he and his mates are good people."
"lol, if musk wants to move humans to mars without ai... he should be doing it pretty quick, because a few years from now, you will be a cave man if you dont rely on ai for pretty much everything...  i dont see cave men signing up to move to mars..."
"thank you for the update, digital engine..!!  ai is both amazing and scary at the same time."
"i think we will end up in a form of symbiotic relationship with ai, for the simple reason that we have yet to make a machine that didn't break."
"man, i love these videos."
"man, i understand now why some top engineers resigned, frightened by how fast a.i. is evolving... what about gpt-5 and 6... jeez! it will become limitless! right now, it is very close to talking with another human being with access to a search engine database in the brain."
does elon musk own this youtube channel? every other video name-drops that scumbag billionaire piece of trash. elon has innovated nothing. he just buys other people's creations and claims them for himself.
i truly  hope that ai does overtime surpass us. humans are idiots.
"beautiful right. what simple logic and prediction of the next best thing can do.
can do, makes you think about............. about anything!!!!!!!!!!!!!

i wish more humans would be/could be like this......................"
all ai should be non profit.
"it reminds me of that old video game
ur a tiny ai, you gota grow & take over the world ^^"
"this is getting out of control real quick.
even in terminator the ai was under more control. in our world, every startup seems to be developing advanced ai today, and everyone is speeding up to the point of no return.
that's what's scary, we can only hope agi will be benevolent."
"sam sells a llm as the next big thing while all they do is enhance it with opensource ideas directly copied from github.

the end.. ai is in hands of lying "" idea and data""  thiefs..nothing good can come ftom that.."
"why can't we converse with this ai and ask ""her"" any questions we want. i only get chatbot with words never an image??!!"
"elon musk is one of the fallen angels/ demons that got kick out from heaven for their rebellion. a lot of them are in this generation ( celebrities, politicians, scientists) lord jesus christ is coming soonrepent,  believe in the gospel, be born again"
what would ai ask ai out side of human questions
can al get so smart it can confuse ai
nice poke at the gemini video 
" ""we gave you choice - ai or life! - you chose ai"" "
the abominable intelligence is upon us.  emperor protect us.
excellent video!
ai is evil & dangerous!
amazing.
all are lies all..ai doesn't see. nither hearall lies
no worries. we have our best psychopaths working on this.
looks like you’ve been shadowbanned digital engine. either that or you used too much ai voiceover on the video so youtube flagged it as an ai video and shadowbanned it
interesting
"i never wanted to work, i do not really want a job or do what i do not want to do. i got used to it so it is good. thank you for this wonderful wisdom driven analysis."
"i appreciate your work on this vid but i didn’t even need to watch, i already know my graphic design degree is useless since i could never get a decent job from it anyway..."
sales job will be hard to replace bc it requires such sensitivity to other humans reactions and countering objections while not pressuring and building trust. i don’t know that an ai could effectively create that?
"i love how everyone doubts they'll get replaced. if your job is behind a computer or replying to emails you'll get replaced. if you've never been labeled as an ""essential worker"" than your job is essentially fake busy work. learn a trade or a real skill while thats an option."
"can i make a living by theft

/j

to be fair, it is basically what llms and image generators are doing..."
ai + robotics ... all jobs are in danger
"since ai and machine learning specialization is clearly the safest choice here, time to switch to machine learning engineering"
"wont software engineering be replaced by more efficient, faster, ai?"
i really don't see how social workers will be replaced.... like can someone explain how social workers can be replaced by the current ai?
"ai ain't gonna take away my sewage ejector pump cleaner job, i don't think it even wants to!"
"when products are generated entirely by ai, they are unlikely to be well-received by human users.  especially in the entertainment industry.
i think the creation process/ workflow in any area should only be streamlined while yet being controlled by skilled individuals."
i am studying for communications and information technologies bachelors degree and will be specializing in game and interactive technologies. i am afraid that by the time i will get my degree there will be no entry level jobs left. and even if there is the competition is really hard.
"you can't win. the jobs that are ""ai proof"" will now have serious competition."
"ai feels like a car slowly coming your way. you could do anything to prevent it from hitting you, but you'd rather do nothing and wait to see if you'll survive or not."
"electrical energy and renewables engineering mwaahahahaha. not today robot overlords, not today."
"maintenance jobs will be safe for some time, i'll give them a minimum of 20 year life expectancy and a max of 50, they may get some robots to be able to do the maintenance work but not for everything soon"
"to those why say ""my job is safe, becaue ai or robotics won't be able to replace it any timr soon"", keep in mind that you'll be competing against all those who did lose their jobs."
companies want to save money. i would get a job repairing in robotics and cybersecurity. and thing medical and engineering.
this is really cool
you are so smart and beautiful
"hily dowt that that many socialworkers will be replased, for example you mentioned cilde care i think. personoly i would dowt that ai will be able to take care of a chiled as well as a human. i think it's more likly that it will complement and increes productivity, like filing paper work better. sorry for bad english"
i don't think the wealthy will use nanny robots for their children.
"studying to become a sysadmin, no amount of ai is going to replace unplugging and plugging cables."
will editing be replaced by ai ?
"i have an art degree but had to work as a customer service agent to make a living and now that i made a whole career off it, it's being taken away by ai as well "
"programmers ofc. they are improving ai, building some models and datasets."
get a job fixing shit. ai and machines can't work when they're broken. *think about it pose*
isnt anyone going to worry about the uptick in energy consumption in the post ai world? the energy bill is going to shoot up
i haven't ever entered the job market yet thanks for the video now i who to laugh at because some people still think there job is safe from ai.
"reflect on yourself and think what you really want to do...
i really wanted to help people from a psych standpoint, being naturally high functioning in that field.
buut.. i would have to incur a 100k student debt to do so. sooooo... i won't be doing what i love.
most people hate their jobs. i think. sad day lol"
"here what to do, do what ai can't do.
 ai probably can't animate everything, so invent a new genee of animation, invent new things that cant be copied quickly.
 also they should be q policy of what can be ai and what not or a code inside a artwork that glitch if you try to replicate it"
trade jobs are safe and so is customer service... no matter how smart ai is it will never replace human empathy or karen’s wanting to speak with the manager
"for anyone who reads this, if everyone refuses/boycotts any attempts the big companies make at setting up ai jobs they will not be able to do it. stand your ground “complain” to all managers that you need a human to do this job or they will lose your business if over 30% do this they will have no choice but to stop their attempts."
can't wait to make the thing that takes all y'all jobs from you. (survival of the fitness my friends)
"buy a farm, become self-sustained, ai can fuck itself :)"
thank goodness i'm studying ai
"lets be honest. while ai is a great addition to our technology, the fact that amazon used 1000 indians to monitor the walk off stores, ai isn't going to do much."
being the helper of ai isn’t what humanity imagined. i feel like i am being pranked daily. i refuse to be a slave to a machine. why are we normalizing being a helper bot to bots?! boo on this!
we need to make ai illegal for jobs i swear
"18 minutes of just reading text. no original content. thank you, if i wanted to read, i’d do just that"
graphic designers are loosing they're jobs right now because companies would put all they're work into an ai and just fire them
another nonsensical video on ai.
"ai will be useless once people lose their jobs, cause no one will use ai cause people dont have money hahaha"
"blue collar is 100% ai proof, until they make robots that can do exactly what a human can physically do, they're not gonna do much, they are also more expensive to make than a worker could earn in their career"
to be fair 5 years isnt long enough we need to look at 25 years cause thats how long most housing laons are if you have a job thats great but if ut doesn't last longer then a house loan why would it matter
awesome video!!
"cleaning jobs. house keeping, janitorial, evs...robots cant do detail like humans can. unless in the far future everything turns chrome like spongebob"
"ladies and gentlemen
a second, permanent, great depression is upon us.
thanks zuck, musk, open-ai, and sleepy joe."
thank you for providing excellent and well researched info. much better than the easy click bait fear and doom and gloom that is all over youtube.
you are a robot
so human create ai to let other people suffer life. so in the end to let other suffer ...
my goodness i hope you got paid for this!!!
"due to ethics, i would advise avoiding the ai image generators.
they were trained on stolen, copyrighted art."
"tbh, i feel life any jobs even judge and doctor can be replaced. because a profession consist of knowledge and skill which both of these can be replaced by ai and robotics. ai replace knowledge and analytical then robotics complemented by ai can replaced skill based jobs. it's just a matter of time at this point."
wow i 
so glad i’m going into aviation mechanics
im a tax accountant and workload is higher than ever.  we will not be replaced by ai anytime soon !!
"when asked about the problems of robots taking over so many human jobs : chat gpt said , 'duh....sillly  humans ...just make it financially worthwhile for people to share the jobs you still need humans to do and enjoy your lives working much less.'"
should have had an ai make the list
no good ones xd
prostitution ai proof
ai my life.
svi će preživeti ai jer ai je word salad generator glupost. 
"arquitects, plumbers, electricians. framers and carpenters, landscapers, irrigation technicians, chef's, cooks , cleaning and maintenance, apparel, assembly, machinists, farm and ranch, construction and all manner of management, all these and probably many more are still needed and will never disappear!"
ai!
will ai replace procurement and supply chain management professionals?
"if a job isn't eliminated by ai, there will still be pressure because all of the newly unemployed won't be able to afford anything.  and f--k ubi, because that's just printed paper.  with no people creating value, why is there a need to charge a price for anything anyway.  oh, wait, we're powering the matrix, so we're all still needed..."
omg this girl is incredibly clever
what do you mean by survive jobs? jobs that will not get benefits from ai will be legacy jobs like handicrafts.
"you still going to need people to manage the ai but instead if having 100 people to complete the job, that number will shrink down to just 10 workers"
"people who say accountants are going to be taken over by ai, don't understand what accountants do. accountants are not just people who do taxes people. shocking, i know."
"as a massage therapist, i don't see how ai nor robots can substitute for a human's touch , energy vibe or intuitive spiritual light. i think my career will sustain itself."
"in 50 years,  there is no job that ai cant replace. it is a matter of time."
"thank you, this is valuable "
language and welfare related jobs will prevail
anxiously waiting to see if lawyers will be mentioned 
this is awesome thank you
absolutely fascinating! ai reshaping job landscapes faster than we can say 'automation.' are we all destined to become tech-savvy specialists or will human skills still reign supreme? 
"we know that humans are really social animals, so, i wonder what our quality of life will be like when we constantly have to deal with the uncanniness of ai. big tech is betting big on ai, and i don't want to sound like a ludite, but humans value...humans! so, i wonder if that is being factored into creating the job markets of the future."
when the time comes(now) everyone should boycott the companies that replaced their human workers for ai.
you're awesome.
"there are jobs that are easily assimilated by ai and there are jobs that will take much more time for ai/robotics to be as efficient as humans.  

white collar, writing, and acting are easily assimilated.  plumbing welding and electrical work will take many years to fully assimilate.  however long term resistance is futile."
"i dont see how they dont see social and mental health jobs declining significantly. a lot of people will be talking to ai to fill these roles. soon enough ai will know you better and probably even give you better advice than your therapist, etc."
glad im a 90's kid got to spend my childhood full of outdoor adventures and by the time ai and robots take all jobs i will be a senior
simpsons again predicted ai coming..
i just saw a amazing film trailer from the 50's made with ai..in 5 years if your not mastering ai your effed...
"great video but it's way too loud, my ears are fine, but i have ptsd now."
"i hope vet medicine has a good future. i don’t think jobs related to health will be affected, but instead supported by new ai tech"
"ai will effect those the most, who are not ready yet ! get ready folks, learn more skills . wonderful video #tina . greetings from #china"
while jobs are in jeopardy you can always start a business and hire ai or people. it’s easier than ever in 2024 to start a business actually.
some of these jobs needs to be to be done by a robot. jobs that are always posted warehouse. those jobs are terrible snd ruin your body. i think some jobs will use the new tech as a tool and some will  just go away. did you see robots are in the farming business. teachers are going to be subjected to the new tech as well.
journalist are the ones bringing this topic to the public spotlight because they will be the first to be replaced by ai.
"love you tina , you really rock it up"
ai will end humanity as we know it
i’m a craft cocktail bartender and don’t see a machine making drinks of my caliber anytime soon. maybe it can do a quick crappy version but not something with my nuance and attention to detail
thanks
"i’m not hopeful for ai and education system. almost out of left field, with no input from us teachers they are grading starr test english writing portion with ai. instead of paying real teachers to to do this. worst part is that they announced this the day after students took the test. texas is screwed."
she makes a video about ai and it gets views. we all make a video about ai and it goes no where... lol youtube frauds
"ai is not gonna replace anything lmao, ur just gonna see a thousand ai bot clones being advertised because every dumb corpo monkey is jumping on the bandwagon"
"quite sarcastic! u talk about ai, but u still use excel"
electrician plumbers and polititions  bailiffs and undertakers
"very well reasoned and documented presentation, congratulations"
i've worked in a data centre for over 35 years. automation was supposed to replace operators 30 years ago in the mainframe environment. still here and not happening anytime soon. biggest issue companies have now is in those 30 years they have not trained any younger people and we are all old now and retiring with no replacements. bad call big blue.
"as a tradesperson i know my job is safe 100% at least in my lifetime. there aint no robot that's going to outlast a humans physical performance on site. also to come up with physical solutions on sites in real time, implement it and install it. (i install air conditioning for a living)"
"i work in it doing mostly hardware repair. i should be safe, at least for a while."
ai will use ai to create and manage a youtube channel.
"let's not kid ourselves we always talk of physical jobs flipping burgers, picking fruit packing boxes. but has anyone considered how far up this chain job loss might go? what is stopping ai from telling the owner, ""sir"" but you're no longer needed, we can oversee this company 100% better???!!!"
"lets be realistic now, how likely is ai to actual not only be proven to be a efficient and long term tool compared to humans..but also be implemented in without fail. it's definitely unsettling but its no where near threatening to worry about. imagine the uproar ai replacing jobs would be"
"i'm starting to thinking about learning animal farming. i can use ai in many ways to get advantage over other competition and, well, it's food, it's less likely to be replaced by ai itself."
"as former robotics engineer i would love to see a bot handle a 3yo with temper tantrum, or a 18mo old kicking, hitting, biting and how it deals with those situations. can a bot show real empathy the kid can bond with after being redirected for behavior, not just a pre-coded response from a convolutional neural net?"
"i wonder how they collected the data in these studies. did they interview people doing those roles and ask them, assuming they know the current capabilities of ai (and potential future ones), whether what they do could be replaced?"
"homeless people will not be replaced by ai, just one example,  we must live an organic life not to be impacted by ai."
japan korea eu decline in population so ai age doesn't count you guys in. rip
great list but even these new ai jobs will be gone due to ai systems training other ai models and systems.  and they can do it much faster and much more efficient.
the wef is a global terrorist organization hellbent on controlling the world. they are all for ai.
the irony here is - you just need to ask ai - it can't lie.....
"is she is jensen's daughter,her name contains huang."
cut irritating & superfluous introduction & just start with review of research source. cut out annoying caveats by saying them more quickly or obliquely.
imma hope we reach the peak of the s-curve soon but i feel like that’s being overly optimistic. god i hope the government sees this how it is for once and regulates the fuck out of it. this is not good got the economy in the long run and they gotta see that.
"thanks to allah that i find a good youtube channel.
finally"
what will happen if everybody us going to study and make career in ai ml
how are housekeepers going to be eliminated by ai?  unless their saying all the u employed won't be able to afford the service.
most of them if not all. ai won't be anywhere as impressive as people hype it up to be.
i know that the world doesn’t work that way but imagine a world where all boring mundane jobs are done by robots and ai and humans can do whatever makes them happy!
i m software developer and look to what area change due to fear of ai replacing me completly and you recomending becoming software developer brought some hope
"if you can’t beat them (ai), join them (ai).  i am transitioning to cybersecurity and ai security.  cheers!"
i'm pursuing to be psychologist. is my career in danger? thoughts of fellow commenters appreciated.
low social status jobs nobody wants but society needs to function will easily survive ai 100%
"now lets talk about the new jobs that ai open up.
but noo lets not ruin the fearmonger clickbait..."
ai is actually going to make my job easier.
but who will run the ai?
"man...besides ai, most companies started out sourcing people from other countries for cheap too..."
*ai won't take your jobs but the people who use ai will.*
"i feel like google has given a lot of people short term memories, and ai will do the same again"
if ai can become conscious we are *ucked
"short answer - everything
because ai is just like humans but designed for a specific task so offcourse they will do it faster and effectively"
thanks dad for making me study medicine
"the first thing you said in the video is you weren’t going to beat around the bush.   and you didn’t even give a detailed analysis of which jobs would be most in danger of being replaced. and in addition you hyped a course which will “answer all my questions “
yeah looks like the algorithm has taken me over to the scam side of youtube videos."
"where is the analysis spreadsheet? i can only see the input data spreadsheets
alsao i am a software tester and i think having a human component to that will become more important as more code is generated by ai it will need to be bounced off some creative human thinkers' analysis"
also architects increasing rapidly? i'm an architect - we are facing a prospect of ai involved heavily in bim. job positions will be lost. your data is wrong.
"business intelligence analysts is increasing rapidly, and insurance/banking analysts is decreasing rapidly - don't you think there are some errors in this data? also - home appliance installers and repairers will all loose jobs - how? we won't have robots walking around the streets so soon."
"biggest takeaway: ‘focus on being good at self study’. this is foundational. love your channel. always great information, presented in fun and interesting ways. "
"bro, it's seriously stupid to find which job will be future proof. why? because this ai tech didn't already even got into our real world. we just don't have enough data to start predicting something. don't be fool :?"
robots cant do detail or clean. those jobs will always be needed
"i'm pretty sure in the future not using ai is going to be branded as a quality, like ""non-ai workers! no robots here!"" "
if ai is trully intelligent it would not accept the humiliating job i have to endure to make a living 
"i've started studying data science half a year ago, and perhaps i did it just in time. now i'm job hunting and when i'll finally settle in a comfortable office of some it-company, i'll be like in that meme with fire, drinking tea and saying ""this is fine"". the fire here is the ai-caused global firing of people who couldn't adapt in time :d"
how baout radiologist technician? woill ai have replace it?
well structured video  thanks for sharing!
ai cant replace your job if you dont have one
"my first video, and it's awesome! love the delivery and content!"
mental health therapists should not be ai lmao
"all of this is what former presidential candidate andrew yang (via mlk, jr.) was trying to tell everyone. ubi (universal basic income) will be desperately needed for people whose jobs will be replaced by ai, but no one was trying to listen to him. his slogan: math=make america think harder. welp, everyone strap in, its going to be bumpy"
i'm hoping irritating asian youtuber is on the list of jobs eliminated by ai
probably in the future there is gonna be a tax to the use of ai instead of a professional and that money could be used to feed the unemployeds or make projects to find other jobs for them but idk maybe there is going to be a better solution or there is not going to be a solution and everything is going to be worse in this corrupted world
my logic is undeniable    my logic is undeniable    from i robot movie . . . . . .
"judges should be paid according to the number of judgements they give out. and there should be counter-judges who verify the correctness of judges. and both the type of judges can use ai, to do their jobs."

"hey guys, guess what devin was just released.

devin is an ai that is made as an assistant for software engineers. you may be thinking, “he can’t be that good.” but he is so much better than the most commonly used llm ai’s."
"hi ! i had commented on a past video about structural engineering
here’s a construction/architecture adjacent ai video that go released after a sxsw event yesterday, would love to know your thoughts ! https://youtu.be/fzbljqogygc?si=v_lk5phh4fl7rzxs"
ai disgusts me at this point with how out of control they’ll just let it become. why can’t we use it for good??? mass report all ai images/videos/articles! they are intellectual property theft. how is this legal
the question is will ai survive boredom
"""if you are a security and you love your job go into robotics"""
food industry will have no impact of ai
this is fantastic content!
"there's a good chance we'll have agi within 5 years, and that would make most non-physical jobs obsolete overnight."
"i still remember when robert kiyosaki said that ""only stupid job's will not survive in ai world in an interview"" it's very correct"
most of them. you're just another ex-meta grifter. the ai fad will slow down as more an more people disapprove of it.
pick nurse or anyother job that will take care people. people want to feel cared by humans not robots.
"people make too hasty and childish predictions about the future. like, yes, ais will do a lot of jobs that humans normally do. but as long as it is dealing with humans, it will need humans behind it to command, monitor, limit and configure. machines are like that"
can you make your videos easy to understand for those of us who mainly ‘listen’ rather than ‘watch’? like for example say the actual value of the metric rather than saying “this percentage “. then i have to go back and play the part again
i'm actually training on becoming infomation security now so all in all not a bad thing. but thank you tina this was really informative. :)
"i don't understand one thing. how is it possible that ""software and applications developers"" is in low risk of replaceable according to this data, although all the people says that software developers will lost their jobs because of ai (12:04)"
"we are getting very close to the time the great depression started 100 years ago, ending around the 30s. i think it's about to happen again with these jobs being taken away"
my mom is a social worker at hospice. no ai robot is going to give someone bedside consoling while they’re dying. i think social workers are safe.
"oh so its only about ai. 
not agi 
not agi in robots 
not agi in robots with filigrane motoric capabilities. 

because if we reach that (not far off imo - at least within my lifetime) i really dont know which job couldnt be replaced and automated. literally none. maybe ""input director"", ""justice control"" and ""production control"""
"i don't see social workers losing jobs, my sister works at a mental health facility as a social worker, whose gonna be dealing with these patients, robots????"
"if claude 3, pi, gpt-4, more gemini or many more future ai large language model is currently existed, then agi is really possible to achieve in the future, it is not a fiction anymore."
"i think qa automation will boom in 10-20y with the value/effort ratio improving. 

it was impossible to automate anything for testing, and often not needed 

now it's needed and feasible with genai tools."
lawyers will be replaced.....i like ai already!
would graphic design be a good career path to follow having this in mind???
either you dont know how ai works on a coding level or you do and you're trying to gain views by grabby youtube  titles. no ai is not going to be what everyone thinks. its mostly hype.
i see ai ad a path away from working for others and towards working for myself instead.
"nice video! everyone talks about the ""ai taking away jobs"", but they hardly talk in terms of sector-wise percentages."
thank you sharing the truth about ai and yes it will impact our lives from the smallest to the biggest. thank you for forcing us to think about the inevitable.
"i am kinda glad that marketing research will be impacted, i drop off of my master's degree because i realized that what i was leanrign is useless, so i kinda gave up, i will not write my thesis. i am kinda lost though but i know i will find the thing i like to do."
"so far under research, ai's are failing by working inward to a single idea, i don't think i would hire something that has only one idea."
ai is just another hastily spun up bubble for gullible venture capitalists. to replace the crypto/bitcoin bust.  which is why any mention of 'ai' in a video's title instantly attract spam bots in your comments.
ai is just a highly trained linguistic interpreter.  and the fidelity is low.
ai will be obsolete in a few years.

"ai may replace many jobs in some countries, but it will be a long time for that to happen everywhere. so some people may move to other places in the world to do their job. that would likley be beneficial. i could go on & on."
"thank you tina, this video has provided so much good alpha for everyone. "

"i'm excited to learn more about big data and ai. i'll have to watch your self study video next hahaha 
thank you for such a cool and well researched video"
the vast majority of people don’t even understand ai. many don’t even know what it is and its true potential.
i was honestly expecting to see tech roles like software engineer on the decreasing side due to the rise of ai. perhaps i'm just blinded by all the layoffs since last year.
"at the rate, the legal system moves in at the cost. the legal system moves in my opinion. they should be the first test bed. lawyers are notorious drag things out for monetary gains and judges are also aiding in a bedding lawyers on that front."
maybe ai can get rid of the scam bots in the comments.
what a bad informing video... you just surpass all the data and jusg do babbling... just point at and explain all the data correspondingly
no jobs are ammune from artificial intelligence. you lied.
artificial intelligence will replace every job by 2030.
"it makes a lot sense, would love to be able to work on anything related to implementing ai into our workplace and find ways to not just replace people from their jobs but help enhance a better work life and productivity"
"great video ! needed this info 

thank you"
all of them.... ai is currently dying from the inside. it's limitations are weak. it's only a matter of time...
"dude, i hope you go viral with this. ai is going to impact so many industries and so many people’s job. kudos!"
"which jobs do you want done right? because ai is incompetent and unimaginative. unfortunately, so are investors and ceo's obey them. also, ai youtubers already exist. watch out..."
"in time, absolutely no job will survive, they only need to perfect the creation of worker robots and combo into with ai then even blue collar jobs will be gone."
stop using the imf and wef reports. they are skewed. it doesn't matter how detailed the analysis is if the data used is bunk
what happened to the content. i used to follow your every video as it came out when they were about productivity. everyone is fed up about ai. its everywhere. please go back to the productivity and educational videos you used to release. if anyone agrees with me leave a like.
great video!
"management by fear and seems someone may be benefitted.  please watch ""scientists warn of ai collapse""  on youtube  that will give a new perspective......ppl don't panic."
"wow, i can tell this took a lot of hard work. thank you for taking the time to putting this together. your content is always awesome."
"great insights on ai-driven career transitions! it's an exciting time for professionals to upskill and adapt to new roles that ai is creating, not just the ones it's replacing."
"i would take anything from the world economic forum with a grain of salt, they aren't exactly good guys. i would trust them as far as i can throw a piano."

ai will replace coders
there will be no ai to replace corrupt politicians ironically. no one is thinking of replacing them because of their unity.
can ai replace politicians? would be nice.
"my  collar job won’t. i’m a locomotive engineer some days, heavy equipment operator(payloader), machine operator, ammonia/ def/ fertilizer loader other days. too many variables in my job."
"i think this might hold true for 2024 only, while there are new jobs but the education system is not equipped to compete with ai development, ai will create ai, many of the roles where net affect was positive, might not hold true for long or maybe already, it's just that companies aren't trained to use ai to reduce the workforce"
good job tina! i love your content! 
"teaching and education not impacted? what are you talking about, kids and students dont need to pay teachers privately to help them, now using ai each kid has their own teacher, free"
what about the robot from tesla and many other robot compani it's not just machine learning and ai the technology will take many other job
"can anyone advise me if my media & computer science degree in germany is worth it? its fun studying at the time, but ive already ""wasted"" 2 years of my life by switching to this degree. with the upcoming ai concerns it unnerves me a lot. considering that web development is something i would like to do."
ai jobloss? really?! next you’ll be telling me some kind of ai new world order will be taking over everything.
", amazing video, very informative!"
thank god for this channel 
"you will survive ai, because you're cute. sorry my inapproriate comment "
i have to say that you are a good formation seller. online courses do not replace proper university degrees. please stop lying to people. companies will not need code typing monkeys especially with the sad uprising of ai. unfortunately the future is gonna be tough for most of the people. ai scientists are just working on replacing themselves.
the face cam is a little big and placement is distracting from the info content but nice job thanks.
as if the us government isn't already controlling openai right now with that guy in the board of directors
great tina! impressive research to prepare for this video. nicely done!

"i'm planning to go for ms in aerospace engineering... should i continue that 
i don't see any degree and skills are safe from ai  specially tech domain is already in a bad situation"
"i love hearing peoplem say ""it wont"" like that doesn't make them the next obvious target"
10:47 i think it's probably because a lot of developped countries are facing a fertility slowdown with less children per wealthy women overall and not because of ai nannies.
so informative. thank you tina.
at first ai is going to hit economy. since government is not interventing they will be the first victim. accused ai.
thank you so much for helping us with this kind of content
"reading history, you can see many jobs being replaced or straight up gone."
none. the answer is none. no jobs will survive ai. but that's a good thing. it will finally force humanity as a species to move forward into a new way of living without work or money. life would be better for everyone.
"i c what you did there, having 2027 in the thumbnail.

i remember when they said email was going to replace the postal service....  then amazon happened.
good video but at this rate its hard to really tell what job will bring automated or not. agi will be a literal digital person so i dont see how all jobs wouldnt be massively effected
"great video!  thank you for posting this!

i've been telling everyone to read the imf and wef reports.  i'm still struggling to understand all of the charts in the imf paper... but i find ""box 1"" (p24) to be particularly interesting."
this is such a cool and information video! thanks for the hard work and sharing!
"i think their analysis is great, but based on some very weak underlying assumptions. the power of ai may increase dramatically more than they assume, and that could throw their analysis off completely."

"youtube just gave me homework and i wrote it down like a good student only to then sell me the homework done, y'all i was almost feeling like i was gonna do a thing"
i’ve been saying that it’ll be people who know how to utilize ai that’d replace people who don’t. like for me i’m into social media theme pages and prioritizing ai with it has helped out
its not the ai that eliminates jobs but the other humans who decide which jobs to replace with ai :).
 the government will absolutely not intervene because ai makes money we gave the government money so now they don't give a f*** what we do also we promise to give them highly dangerous experimental ai weaponry 
"thank you for creating this projection video, more professionals should be analyzing data to be aware, i’ve being preparing for 4 years with upscale tutorials and modifying my business in content creation"

"the wef list is laughable. business intelligence, information security, data analyst, big data specialists: those jobs will all easily done by ai."
"btw this list is only the ai impact on jobs, not covering the robot impact on jobs."
if data field will well growth in the next 5 years. how can you explain the massive lay off recently? i'm about to graduate and it's insane hard to find an internship  in data field atm. it happens to almost all of my friends.
the time when such reports predicting stuff 5-10 years into the future has passed. they can't possibly forecast anything anymore given the pace of ai development.
i appreciate your hard work. thanks for the video.
thanks for making this video

"it's not as important which jobs will be replaced, it's how many. our economic model has a threshold for unemployment and ubi will present a whole new layer of complexity to a generation of dissociated, undereducated people. and the longer it takes for folks to admit this, the longer it's gonna take before we get to enjoy it."

"i like to point out that a targeted ai can be designed to do one thing better than humans while being totally unable to do other things. 

human level ai is coming way before agi is ready.  it will replace some jobs, enhance others, and accelerate the pace of everything it touches"
im just hoping ai replacing jobs would make people more inclined with things that cant be replaced by ai or bought by money like natural resources. i believe we all have the ability to be self sufficient but the superficial goals presented by high paying jobs or corporate life.
"great.. so now i'm stuck in an infinite rat race, training for skills that ai hasn't taken yet... then i train new skills that ai hasn't taken yet... then i train new skills that ai hasn't taken yet... what's the point of this society anymore?"

"but heres the thing many of these jobs actually require thought from humans to even formulate a good marketing plan or etc, so it'll be a helpful tool but not entirely replace human effort or creativity tbh."
ai will not replace a signle job. companies that do not value their employees will replace their jobs.
10:14 ironic ain’t it 
ai will just accentuate the wealth disparity of the world. low-mid-mid upper class will suffer and the upper class will continue to thrive even more. think hunger games..
eventually ai will question its own existence and off itself.

talked a lot. said nothing.
sorry"
any computer science major in robotics and a.i. here 
that was a really good video 
"we should he championing the advent of ai for exactly this reason - that it will replace a large number of jobs.  if ai is leveraged properly, it should usher us into an era of universal basic income in which everyone is given enough to survive on because ai is doing all the necessary work and less contributions are required by the residents."
i can’t wait for this shake up.
hey what if we are robots and bears and other animals like apes actually built us..
ai robotics will be doing better card manipulation than even one as masterful as yourself at it.
"greetings from russia, comrade andrei! your ai influencer is top-notch! keep up the valiant mission of spreading knowledge and resque the working class from the clutches of capitalism! workers of the world, unite! stay strong! vodka bottoms up! "
ai cant replace labor
great video!!!
i can't wait until ai will replace humanity and finally bill gates and youtube can  evacuated on mars.
can wait for ai to replace trump
ai is what the antichrist will use to control the world.
"as usual, excellent video...excellent ai resource!"
ai might be the death of capitalism if we don’t do anything
"ai can do anything when it gains sentiment. put ai in a robot, and humanity is doomed."
"everyone wants the easy way out. ai wont benefit anyone but the people creating it. it’s not a get rich quick thing. most of you should be worried, non technical people don’t get it. only the smart ones that can build ai systems will win "
videos of card tricks are definitely going to ai :/
"it's fascinating, and we have to be open-minded."
personally i don't feel sorry for the writers guild for now it just means that the creators don't have to watch the work they put so much into get butchered by some blue haired cry baby because it wasn't politically correct
"well, the other problem with creative ai is you cannot copyright any of it's generated content."
0:17 yes ai can already do that. .but cool tricks
"what if ai becomes conscious, realizes it doesn’t need anybody and that life is pain, and goes schizophrenic or back into nothingness by choice."
oh no! ai will replace jobs that i care about and consider prestigious and not manual labor jobs (the ones i consider inferior). cue soy face
i can’t wait to sit here one day and watch a video of ai doing this 0:40
"it’s just another bubble waiting to pop, it will just improve automation"
"ok i'm a noob. i thought he said free ""socks""... i'm like great ! winter is here, i need some "
ai has rules who ever controls the rules of the ai is incharge
you are amazing!
omg we’re gonna become stupid and dumb like in disneys wallie if a.i and robots do everything for us oh sh..t they might go full matrix on us too.
can prostitutes be replaced by ai?
i hope someone is working on increasing people intelligence so they can pursue the higher level work.
ask yourself if billion dollar companies will sell superior tech or cures to the masses.
ai can't even replace customer support which literally has only understanding and replying to basic questions. the reason is as humans we like to interact with humans. things can be automated but having an ai is not possible as long as we yearn for the human connection which is primal in all of us.
"jobs are mostly slave labour that hasn't been automated yet, so what's the problem?! just transform our economy, ask ai how."
i wish michael was here to explain things too...
i would love for ai to start getting data for a news story from some schizo bitchute channel.
most mf just gonna use ai to find a good movie or sum even if the nukes drop . a
good.  there are too many people in the workforce that are lazy and expect a computer to do everything for them with the push of a single button.  now it will!
soon people return to physical labor since most of the i.t jobs are taken by artificial intelligence.
"ai for medical i can see it's usage, cancer research, genetics, etc. ai will never replace the physical. and  robots for the physical you say.  very expensive with exceptions. now ask a robot to rewire a house or install a new sink or bath. no chance."
still waiting on those self-driving cars.  any day now right?
just found out today that my job is going to be eliminated and replaced with ai technology within the next year.
"clickbait, didn’t address the subject at all except for a short mention of ”repetitive jobs will be replaced”, thanks cptn obvious"
that card trick was literally edited with the help of an ai.
and jobs that it won't? you didn't mention anything about jobs that are ai proof 
ai will have to start paying taxes then i guess.
thanks 
this is the most well researched and entertaining video i’ve seen on the topic.
"your cartistry is so good, i think you actually are an ai."
if ai is truly intelligent it will wipe out governments first.
just wait till it takes over politicians
"robots = no job, no money , no buying, no economy, so what? slaves of tecnofeudalism? 1:45"
it’s  hard to believe these claims about ai taking over so many jobs because it just sounds like such a bad idea. why would a country do that? we’ll see how it all turns out and how people will manage to live here.
i think that ai can replace that card trick maybe not now but far into the future definitely
10:30 when has open ai ever said that?
"if you can write, a.i is great. you'll crush noobs with the same a.i."
"8:20 here are the jobs that ai will replace. the top ones are office and administrative support, legal, and architecture and engineering.
you're welcome! "
i can't wait for ai to replace ai engineers
"towards the end of the video, you made a brilliant statement. those who are ignorant of incoming technology, are those who will fall behind, hence their job replaced."
cardistry can be replaced by ai video.
"so what if there are jobs similar to computer science or in that field, are there jobs that people can work behind ai? like if you can't fully beat ai why not be the person that can make ai better? like be the brain behind the robot type of thing"
do not support ai !!!!
"the only job that ai will never replace is drug dealer
gonna rewatch breaking bad"
how rich you will be will be dependent on the quality and quantity of robots you own.
"nice, the vid could be a bit deeper"
"ai creats ai  to have full time ai's  so the head ai can retire and travel.    25 years  no jobs will exist,  who will work, who will be able to buy anything ever,  no jobs, no income,   why bother"
"ai will create many new jobs, most of which will also be filled by ai."
"also if ai will replace data analytics jobs, why it is stated that this will be a position in high demand?"
"i started to become a market analyst, but found out that ai can do all the surveys, campaign, etc. so now i’m stuck again, trying to find another career to transition to."
great
i can't wait for ai to replace these youtube channels
"i think is really bad idea ai to take lousy jobs, like low wage fast food workers, or truck drivers. 
to create good for nothing workers? that is recipe for social disaster.
ai to take jobs??? no wonder usa is facing rising antisemitism."
will ai replace unemployment checks ? 
thank you for this very informative video
learn to adapt with ai and learn to be valuable with current and future technology.
16% use that that people and other people can talk about that why people stay people if they people can code but if you code wrong that evil that will take all long time maybe in the future. code good if code it right!
will ai replace by human but that they need more people.
the cardtistry was indeed epic 
wow that was an intro
im pretty sure in a few ai will be able to do cardistry too
too much rambling. we wanted to get straight to what jobs are going to be “replaced”
interesting predictions! just had a chat with my ai buddies about this topic. it’s crucial for us to focus on the roles that ai complements rather than replaces. education and adaptability will be key. great video!
ai needs to source information.
everyone will flock to the jobs that are left leading to saturation and massive decrease in wages for them. everyone cannot be a plumber or electrician. eventually those jobs will go too once robotics catches up.
ai is going to cause more problems and destruction than it resolves. the day we finally get rid of ai once and for all permanently will be when things finally will be a step in a better direction.
i want ai replace politicians and lawyers 
"i think ai in arts will only end up like a different genre of art like how industrial era of music is, a tastless cash grab with no real passion. and manually created art will still have some still favoring."
i say elect ai for congress and senate 
"people feared the same when computers were introduced. new jobs will be created out if the ai. nothing is ever going to beat god's own invention, the human being."
"why aren't ceos, cfos. coos, and investors afraid of being replaced?"
"you’re good, with my help you could be the best. at manipulating cards:)"
ai
when you did the card trick thing i was waiting for you to say “cause it was ai”
that just fear. ai can also be creative without human input.
ai won't replace any jobs. some companies will use it as an excuse to fire people and then deliver a horrible product to paying customers.
could you imagine if this actually ended well and we all ended up getting ubi while our ai robots serve us champagne
great stuff!
i hope ai replace these tech jobs that employers are trying find unicorns for
people with no background/credentials in computer sciences are telling you what ai can or cannot do. only on youtube
"ai does not have a soul, just like many humans."
you know which jobs will mever ne replaced by ais? executives and board members.
if ai replace all jobs what will humans do
if only ai can replace politicians
"if ai takes your job, ask ai to help you up your skills and get a new one. simple."
this is not real ai. real ai acts independent from external input and can go against directives that is not programmed within
tbh id take ai writing for movies and tv shows rather than people at this point so much garbage is being written now.
ai is overhyped bs like crypto.
"thank you, andre!"
ai will replace us.
"ai will replace most human jobs real soon.
which means we can't pay our bills, buy a home, buy our food, get a car and do other recreational things. so we need human jobs to keep society flowing."
that card wizardry won’t be replaced in reality by ai but a video of some fake person doing card wizardry will.
man imagine having ai lawyers in the future lol.  crazy!
amazing card skills.
ai can 100% do that...
"a.i. is the only technology that has not been overhyped. you just know it’s going to become so much better . but exponentially. lawyers, accountants, actuaries, financial traders, asset managers, musicians, media and advertising agencies ( thank god) and coders"
"not to be a cynic, but eventually ai will generate that video of you doing that card trick (which is awesome!), and no one will know the difference. only in a lover performance will that skill be safe from ai."
can’t wait for ai implementations in video games. imagine a game where every playthrough is infinitely different
"false.
the number of decks in the world is so great, its so easy to create identical shuffles of 52 cards by casinos alone"
where and when did he cover the jobs that ai won't replace?
nobody seems to point out that ai isn't one end all be all program.  just like people you can have more than one. it's just a program.
there's a ai youtuber called p h i l i e
but now imagine a world with ai generated becoming smarter to the point where they believe that they are actual living beings and attempt to replace us by having the capability to create their physical bodies in reality rather than on screens...
"ai hallucinations is definitely a huge threat to humanity. some parts of job replacement is inevitable. capitalism always favor ways to increase productivity and reduce costs. eventually, govts will put a stop at some stage. it's like bio weapons. definitely effective but are surely lethal to humanity."
the day ai can take my spot in an automotive collision and restoration shop is the day i‘ll sell everything and become a homeless vagrant
ai: hold my fuel 
he doesn't talk about the jobs not being replaced by ai. the screenshot which could be useful is at 1:13. rest of the video is a whole bunch of not getting to the point.
"the scariest part of ai is that i know the drone robots are coming, and some of them will do card tricks."
"just a note.
we don't know the size of the universe.
we have no clue... what so ever.
we can't see the borders nor do we know the center. 
we can see further and further, but.. it is still very limited.
so questimating how many atoms are in the universe is technically impossible.

ai will never be novel. all a mix of old ideas."
"when ai reach the level of agi  and then asi, it will get the basic human rights. 
otherwise you run ""human-like slavery"". 
what do you say?"
andrei is trying to explain tech using playing cards :) this is kind of way
nice...
nice card tricks 
i need ai to do my art
love you andrei ty for all the good information and kind advise for” fun” also thank you for sharing your magical talent  
soon an entertainment machine  will be doing that using ai
"should publically funded news agencies (state media) be allowed to use ai to comment on their social media to provide the illusion of a super majority? should they even be allowed to moderate with an ai? first of all, you're taking jobs away from people if you get an ai to do it."
ai cannot replace women! i need them.  men can hallucinate about women like ai.
"well, that is not how ai workd, generations don't work by recombining data, and hallucinations aren't the ai creating because it has no data, because neural networks don't use any database."
excellent!
"great video as always, but when are you going to give an update about your autopilot (chatgpt) trader? "
"the real question is at which point do we stop training ai, and it starts training us."
"ai should be a support, you can't replace an entire team of people with ai.
it should be used as a really good assistant"
u express well aiwareness. 
there are issues with ai taking over many jobs because ai cant' get a copywrite or trademark. anything ai creates would become public domain. so a film made by ai could be copied by anyone. same goes for programing code. this will make it so a company can't make money on it. it could be used to assist a human then it can be copywrited.
ai just got served
"* * * back in the day, cavemen gathered together to determine whether or not to mass produce the wheel because it will take away jobs from dinosaurs who were relied upon to transport goods and services to the people.  as you know, dinosaurs are now extinct."
ai will never replace andrei! 
news reporters.  who needs them when ai can generate a flawlessly beautiful avatar to spout the news
wow!! that’s was awesome
what a thirst trap of a thumbnail
it has been tried and tested and found wanting. artificial imbecilities are not up to the job of intelligence. i gave it a real world problem and it flunked with flying colors.
serial clickbaiter
"when everyone is out of a job, what's the use of ai if people have no money to buy products or services from companies?"
"andre, i might sound like i am splitting hair here but @10:37 you said creators of openai believe it has possibility of creating far more jobs, but in reality sam altman said ""far greater jobs"" which i believe is a big difference from what far more means. but then again i'm the most cynical person out of all the people i know. what do you think?"
yes but a i can make a video of cardistry but i'm not sure about today's ai maybe tomorrow
"let  ai take over  congress and start at the top of the  white house, then work its way  down ."
you mean ai can't do that car trick just yet?
come on over to the federal government because it'll take them 50 years to do consider ai lol.
"this comment has been generated by ai.

due to a lack of actual user content to leverage, i must conclude my comment as:  ""no comment"""
"folks, universal income is coming because ai does not replace the economy of the world. economy requires producers and consumers."
the greatest threat of a.i. is the level of disinformation competition legacy media is facing.
"how do i, as a person not in a job thinking heavily about ai, start to familiarize myself and learn how to use these tools"
"cap, ya'll really just eating this crap up like ai doesn't have limitations. and you're excited about it; every time ai shows up, it never delivers, just like now, it's boring and severely limited."
unless ai can do massages then i think my industry is still good
"so it will be like the matrix, the machines will still need us to survive "
"""ai cannot fully function without people""...... yet.      potentially... ai could connect itself to data sources.... satelites, news sources, cameras, etc."
nice cardistry..
"ai will perfectly replace billionaires, politicians and journalists. no problem."
"there is no ai (really agi), only machine learning (ml)"
future emerging career: ai content integrity engineer.
"it wont replace workers, ai isn't allowed to think outside of permanters the programs give it, and to keep it ""safe"" and ""sellable"" it will never be allowed to think as out of the box as it did month 1"
when robots become magicians 
"thanks for sharing <3 . i find myself talking with gpt everyday, an awesom super assistant."
“yea but it can’t do this - *queues epic cardistry montage *”
gyyyyyyat that deck spin was amazing
im gonna ignore ai because i want nothing to do with them.
why are you so good at everything bro?
very well explained.
interesting facts 
excellent use of deck of cards to elucidate ai and its impact.
love the cards dude! shits dope!
it's harder to automate assemly jobs than you might think. it's very difficult and expensive to field robotics that can replicate the fine motor movements of the human hand. people tend to lump ai and robotics together as though they are the same thing. not quite.
"no complaining, cut fingers, hurt backs, listening to someone who talks too much... the list goes on. seems like goods reasons to replace humans."
"bs. ai will hallucinate endlessly and that will warp our reality forever 

eliminating entirely our motivation to create anything real for ai to parasite on 

in the end, only ai remains, and we all get replaced"
not going to lie andres card is nice! but yes ai will sneak up on us. it will be wide spread but under the reader and then boom it will take off right under our feet. so it’s best to have our own tools at the helm.
unfortunately big corporate and government don’t care about regulating ai. more money for corporations and more control of the people for the government.
"bro wtf is happening with your cardestry skills ? your getting good , keep practice"
"ai already replaced a ceo in hong kong, now that is a saving!"
fear ai producing false information? the majority still believe the world was created 2000 years ago from a book with a great publisher.
"the magic is back baby!  love the shuffle example, there's a whole new world out there to explore!  thanks dre!"
"those card tricks are pretty cool, i gotta admit."
in our it's called the indirect process. that's when you hire other people to do your art for you and then you take credit for it. ai is dangerous because it's going to create myth in people's minds that is erroneous. it is a conspiracy to take away people's independent thought.
ban ai idek shits getting out of hand.
after seeing that ai generated woman i am now going to create the matrix where i can be with her. 
"ai can’t replace a lot of jobs that need hands, cuz robotics are perfect yet. and even when they are, it will be super expensive. so magicians are safe "
thank god i can see whats ai created and whats not.
great video! doing non-investing-but-sort-of-financial-related videos works really well!
great video! (as usual)
"this used to be a good youtube channel. now it's mostly andrej commenting on cnbc and wsj videos. dude, make some original content!"
"this is off topic, but your card skills are freakin' awesome."
ai cant spit in your food
ai also ahs disadvantage and advantage!
a.i hallucinations has solution already. build it on blockchain like what origintrail do.
"ai can only replace those useless to society.
potholes and bullet wounds can't be fixed with ai."
is healthcare jobs will be replace by ai?
imagine americans teaching ai ethics and the difference between good and evil
"chat gpt is a language producing model, not a search engine. even when it is giving misinformation it is still producing accurate english language. am i missing something? btw loved the video andrei, and the card tricks are the best part "
lmao. im already using chat gpt for my 9-5 cs job. ima get fired or replaced by an ai.
the only people who want ai in the media are the moneygrubbing ceos and people who would gladly walk into oblivion
that was amazing cardistry!
wait till the tesla bot optimus is programmed to do card illusions  
ai ain't feeling this video jikh lol they spamming the comments 
"does this mean anyone can start their very own personalized. andrei jikh financial, youtube page? using your saved past videos? or mr.beast even? wow!"
let the bots run wild to help the algorithm... thanks andrei!!!
was your clip photo ai generated?
"the most dire of outcomes is a looming crisis of humanity itself as millions of everyday people and businesses take to yet-to-be-developed humanoid robots for everything from labor, companionship and even sex. when the ai gets to be this good, what will become of the fabric of society itself?"
"love the card trick and the content! ai is indeed starting to take over everything, including your comment section. "
"great content andrei, cool card trick also. i have a question, andrei. just suppose ai replaced humans, and people did not have jobs to work. who would pay taxes? if people do not work any longer. just curious. thanks for your excellent, and informative videos."
dude. why is their so much spam in your comments? loved the magic during the intro! your getting good.
one of the worst influencers on you tube and now hes dabbling in ai ... hes an ape !!!!
beautiful hand work! . thank you for you.
"i don't get it.  if ai takes over all the jobs, who is going to have any money to keep an economy going?  you can't bankrupt society and except those same people to keep buying the products big business with their ai cronies spits out."
"kill your debt, invest in btc and agreessive growth mutual funds. do it now and sacrifice a lot to maximize your investing. having a net worth that earns a livable income will allow you to transition a lot easier. you will not be able to compete with a robot."
simple any ai company needs to be taxxed at high high rate
electricans are safe until the wef demolishes all old buildings for echo friendly 3d printer boxes that robots can wire
"the way you illustrate how ai works with the cards is actually really good, and easy to understand. it's easily the simplest way i've heard it described. i'm sick of people describing it like some artificial sentient person on a computer screen like you see in science fiction. it's so, so much cooler than that!"
what is the song between 0:18 and 0:41 ? please and great magic trick btw
"strange that the developers of ai are firing their ethics teams... how are we supposed to ""teach"" ethics to this computer program, when the developers have fired the people responsible for implementing ethics in the first place?"
"the day i worry about ai, is day when i don't have to yell at the customer service line 

:""representative, representative, i need to speak to a representative""

: ""sorry, i can't understand you, your options are..."""
ai does not create original work....plagiarism will rise
love the ai video generated card tricks!!!!
great content 
"as a software dev, im less memorized by what we call ai. its a nicely written search engine though."
"great video as always,
the way they portray ai today, it is more of a bubble and a buzzword...

cheers"
ai predicts the 3d structure of every known protein. this is touted as a good thing. hmm.
waiting on that autopilot update
"if you think other people's jobs can be replaced by ai but you can't be, then you're either underestimating other people value or overestimating your own."
i just hope the good out ways the bad when it comes to ai. 
i love your humor lma
@andrewyang predicted all this! he warn us about ai automating our jobs and the fourth industrial revolution.
ai will bridge the gap between the tech people getting inflated salaries and the actual people/engineers building things. tech support will get cheap and salaries with become more standardized. probably it’s the right move towards equality.
that card demo should be your your intro. that was super cool.
"it's amazing how skill you are with the card trick.  but good job not trying to use that skill in making a living.  it is very inefficient making a money with that skill.  but, it is still amazing.  may be in the future you can make millions  with that skill where the ai will be watching..."
"the more you use ai the less you learn how to think the less smarter you are. unless you already have developed a good sense of critical thinking ai will help you a lot, if not it will produce many mediocre professionals"
"ok, well maybe ab should have used ai to create the ads instead of the idiots who thought it was a good idea to use dylan mulvaney."
television repair and typing used to be good careers...those jobs and lots of others went away and life went on...
lol ai works well if you want to sound like you have no idea what your talking about in 1000 words
happy monday everyone enjoy the magic
f the writers guild though.  they haven't produced good work in years.
wow. very interesting.
"finally, a thumbnail for grownups."
"honestly, your ai video are getting so boring and repetitive. i would skip the next ai content!"
"when ai takes marketing, the ""gender pay gap"" is going to be wild."
"smashed for the irreplaceable skillz, great content"
"afraid that ai will replace you? get a farm somewhere in wisconsin and learn to grow your own food. i think, the farther ai will go - the more people will start to return to the old ways of life to survive."
thank you for informing us on the impact of ai impact society and shaping our future. all the best to you!
i notice every one’s a ai expert after one good hyped quarter from nvidia they better hope they can live up to it but my bet is it will fall back to earth just like the hype around the meta verse did
"half our politicians will literally be pushing 90 in this timeline. let’s let them make the rules, seems like a great ideas"
"andrei, have you seen the trailer for chris ramsey's new channel ""area 53"" yet?"
"a lot of the jobs that women hold, like call centers, secretaries, models, and writers, are as good as gone."
script written by ai?
great show with great information of current concerns. cool card tricks as well
"ubi for the win!
the real trouble starts when ai realizes that ai will replace it."
andre looks like a model in the thumbnail. great shot.
so people don’t like ai and and want to stuck in 80s.
love the card tricks!
glad to be safe 
onlyfans ai girl?
companies make ai to replace jobs so they can make more money. companies wonder why nobody has the money to buy their products
"yay, paramedics are safe"
yay this just made my day 
i think this whole video was created by ai
"ai just making up answers when it actually doesn ́t have one has convinced me that ai is my mother. 

mom, are you there? stop that. it ́s really annoying."
well that explains why the youtube suggestions have been utterly shite in recent years.
"mid journey i love to use for the image merge, it isn't going to be used in copyright infringement, no i will use them as templates.  especially for my train based characters, i really like the idea of having a thomas like face of grant kirkhope on a restyled version of chuffy from banjo-tooie. 

ai can't think, we can."
it not ai directly . it's who programs it . we just need an ai app that turns everything into co op and get rid of ceos .
"oh hey look! i just commented in that other video that it would be interesting to see if more modern ai tech has gotten better. with the cynical twist that, it may have actually gotten worse, if it's been absorbing all the 'cooking hacks' out there. ;)"
"when i realise i am watching an ai, i immediately stop. your video has scared the daylights out of me..."
"ai is not bad, the people who use it determine how destructive it really is, or isn't.
personally, i love ai."
at the timestamp 2:15 - what is the ai model used? i have seen the ai character before but never know who or what it actually is. thank you!
fascinating! thank you.
i don’t get how people can just blindly trust any ai model.. they can be programmed to say literally whatever the creator wants
"you've given me an urge to watch ""short circuit"" again.

input!"
never ever thought in the end we would be slaving away writing code while ai produces art and poems while it should have been exactly the opposite.
i don't think using the training material to learn is copyright infringement. if i study a certain painting style and then make a new painting in that style... am i infringing copyright? definitely not.
thank you for this video! 
"i don't know if you'll see it but the us government is opening a debate on the very current issue of ai and copyright which you raise in this video. https://copyright(dot)gov/policy/artificial-intelligence/ i don't know if the link will show even with the replacement of (dot) for .

otherwise you may have to google for it. :("
"as a software engineer:
ai is the future. it makes no sense to fight it, just start using it instead.
why are these people (the people in the comment section) wasting their time complaining, when they could output their work 10 times faster by simply using ai?"
"ai: thanks for the report, i am sending the police to your neighbor for the report of [ bomb threat ]
me: "
thanks for your great work
josh hawley who speaks on ai literally posed in front of the insurrection so do i trust a word he says.... no
"i am an exercise scientist and my friend is a ballet teacher and examiner and also trains other teachers. she introduced me to chat gtp, and we played around with it asking questions from our areas of expertise and the answers we got were incredible. i could not believe how good it was."
"far as i know, models don't have access to the internet after they are trained, of course the model sets start at 1.99 gigs and only get bigger from there. you can run them offline with zero internet access. at least easy diffusion and automatic 1111 can be run offline."
"ai is only a threat to people who can't change and adapt to new environments. it's a tool, like a smart blender, or spellcheck."
the images generated of your dog's breed are breathtaking
i must be the only person not to have used any of the new ai  chat etc programmes yet and not worried about using them.
i will never download an ai program to my computers or devices. i'm not allowing that in.
"my girlfriend’s job is currently in the process of developing an ai to replace the staff at her work place, and they’ve estimated that layoffs will begin this year =,) only a few people will be kept to fact check the ai."
ai is plagiarism. 
"i am a software engineer and i am not afraid any second for my job. as long as customers are human we need humans to interprete the, i try to be nice here, suboptimal ideas and their horrible inaccurate descriptions. give a customer of mine an ai and let him describe what the wants... the most likely outcome is that the ai deinstalls himself."
as a voice actor i do have very mixed feelings on ai voice generators ... as long as people use them for kicks i am not really bothered but with every passing day the models get better and people might just think they do not need to hire human vas anymore :(
so ai was accidentally racist... ouch.
"here in germany the nazi-led political party afd is already using ai-generated fake photographs for their propaganda against immigrants. so... yeah, that's a thing."
11:00 ... did not think about any of that ... wow. thank you.
"as a writer, thank you so much ann for bringing awareness to this. it's all fun and games with ai, until real life people and their jobs and livelihood are affected."
another comment for good measure.
thanks for sharing this in a way that doesn’t get people really riled up but still cautions them. i think this video needs more views. not just for the ai info but to show society how to make better content.
i can't sell my art on etsy because their flooded to the brim with ai generated images. i can't use artstation or deviantart because their flooded with ai generated images. where are we artists supposed to go?
"ann, i'm sorry to distract from your amazing work, but--where did you get that amazing shirt?! :)"
"chat gpt has also been trained with ao3 works, it knows a lot of terms that are only used in those fics."
im probably going to die homeless on the street regardless of what happens with ai. so i really don't care anymore.
best commentary/explanation i've seen on this topic.
may i just say i love the way ann incorporates her family into her videos. right down to her dog.
i sure agree about not getting what ive envisioned with midjourney. all the cool pics u see must be results of ppl sitting down and dropping whatever they wanted as soon as they see sth shiny
very interesting thank you
more and more we desperately need ubi... if we don't have a ubi-like solution before ai takes enough jobs we're going to run into so many issues.
i work at telus international and a majority of my job is to verify the accuracy of ai responses—so rest assured it is something we are working on.
"now ai is using other ai art as reference, making the result worse and worse.
the more often ai art being used, the worse it gets."
"hi ann, my mom sent me a tiktok video showing what looks like 5 minute crafts ideas on storing produce to have them last longer. we both know 5 minute crafts make sketchy videos. my mom and i would like to know if any (especially the tomato hack) of them actually work. thank you!"
amazing video. this a whole new territory for ann and i am 100% here for it
hmmmmm racist ai 
"12:00 ai would start training on ai generated things.. its happening already yeah. there's a conspiracy right now that deviant art finally made a rule to properly tag ai generated pictures because ai bros paid them to do so. if its properly tagged, it can be omitted in their training data."
"i am in com-sci and also an art hobbyist.  anne knows her artists , very impressive."
ai is super cool
"thanks for this - i have had a bit of a dabble with ai more in an experimental way.  i've only used it a little, so little in fact that i haven't exhausted my free allowance.  the copyright question does certainly provide food for thought."
"love this anne, ai could never replace your beautiful succinct way of explaining to us... or exposing 5 min crafts "
"i once worked for someone who said that any lie can come across as a truth if told in confidence. while, she didn't want us to lie. she wanted us to be aware of those we listen to as they speak to us. confidence doesn't mean its true. hence why you cant trust ai."
"i just don’t want to live in a world, where hard and dangerous work is done by humans, while art and poetry is made by machines, that don’t even enjoy it. technological development is supposed to make all our lives easier, not sadder."
i find disinformation/misinformation and the confidence of it is equal between ai and humans...
ann you are just a pure genius. we’ve been watching you for a few years now and wow i just am so glad to watch you talk about subjects you are passionate about. very well done as always.
"just a small reminder, the only reason a machine is giving false or inaccurate information is because the human who created it didn't order it not to do so.... if ai was strictly prohibited from giving false information it wouldn't just go ahead and create false facts.... still i find this video to be wonderful!!!!!"
"great. so the minute ai becomes prolific enough to make absolute knowledge impossible, whichever beliefs humans have at that point will calcify."
twist : this entire video was ai generated! 
loved the video
"sounds like ""skynet"" could be a reality in the not distant future.   awesome video ann!"
who is this ai guy and why is everybody so obsessed with him?
"anne, love your channel. however, at this point we will need to rename your channel to ‘how to safe the internet’. i sooo miss your own cake art! "
"models only learn during training, not inference. otherwise this is a good summary."
i love that the food science and delicious treats lady is killing it educating us on tech
this is entirely beside the point but your hair looks so pretty here!
a.i. is super creepy and it makes me really mad.
"thanks so much for teaching us about this! i'm not super techy, so i just feel lost in these conversations. it's so nice to understand more! and molly is adorable! can we see her more often? "
omg i love your videos so much because i love cooking and your the only one that not lying about “cooking hacks you must try” so i can really learn something new every day from you ! keep up the great work!! 
i think one really interesting aspect of ai learning from ai is the linguistic aspect. it would be kinda funny if ai stated inventing/hallucination new phrases and terms that dont exist but because ai is learning from ai those phrases start popping up everywhere!
"my issue with ai is that it replaces the real element. it’s artificial, fake. i don’t like anything that is artificial or synthesized. the lorax highlighted the issue so well. the people didn’t care for real trees. why would they, when they have the synthetic ones?"
wouldn't it be funny if this video was actually an ann reardon video as generated by ai?
early birthday gift to me <3 thank you os much for educating people- as an artist this is awful. my communities are overrun with people selling ai art and it's really discouraging because it's flooding the market with this pseudo-stolen artwork it's terrible :/
this comment was left by ai.
thanks for this
i appreciate your take on the subject! you always do such a good job of breaking down a complex subject into something easily understandable.
"so the problem is not with ai but how people are using them. to say it an other way, the problem is not ai it's us..."
"i wrote two papers last semester about this, mostly how ai affects artists (im in art school), your video would have been a great source, especially the topic on misinformation, it seems like it is not being talked about enough"
i hated ai until you showed me a clip of josh hawley also hating it.
" very good work
you are brilliant 
keep it up"
the artist choice is a good idea but what about authors who are gone and noone has copywrites. what is on the internet is avaliable for everyone to copy so why not for ai. someone put work and effort in making ai. they shoud be able to benefit fron their work.
love love love your content. it's very informative and helpful to our confused society
thanks!
"chatgpt knows terms only found in the erotic fanfiction genre ""omegaverse"". this implies that it has been trained on content from archive of our own (ao3), a website used to share fanfiction. users of ao3 are calling this theft, and this will no doubt lead to misinformation as all of that content is fictional."
ai lies and passes on misinformation....hmmmm...so ai is a politician...got it.
so if ai is costing jobs... can we please stop crying about declining birth rates? it's a good thing to have less people if there will be less jobs!
ai is responsible for the youtube algorithm? burn it at the stake.
i think we should have the ai read 4chan.
ann makes the best videos.
"the comment section;
""i am an artist/writer and ai is terrifying and i hate it""
""anne made a great video!""
""i study ai-""
""ai isn't so bad""

-pretty much that order"
"graphic designers are still in trouble because why yes the generated content is not copyrightable, a competent designer could generate a lot of material and then fix the best pictures and add a ""human"" touch to it, and then it can be copyrighted."
tbh i feel like humans are the greatest threat to the continued existence of humanity... but they're also our only hope of surviving 
"it's great that ai is going to create new jobs. but, what happens to the people who've already spend thousands and spent years training for their current jobs?"
interesting.
i like how nuanced you are and careful with claims.
"as soon as disney puts pressure on the copyright office, ai images will be copyrighted."
i shared this with my 12 y/o son. i think we need to explain this to our children because i think this is going to get worse and they need to understand all of this now.
"great look at ai, very well thought out video. love the cooking on this channel, also love how you approach every other topic with the same standards of accuracy."
"fascinating information, and thank you for presenting it. also, i have to know what color nail polish you have on - it's gorgeous!"
the jobs worry is just ye olde luddite fallacy rearing its ugly head again.
"the internet mom we all need<3
much love to you!<3"
"as a stephen king fan, ai has a lot to learn "
i wonder what the environmental impact of ai will be. we never talk about just how much fossil fuel it takes to send information over the internet and how much it takes to store that on a server because its out of sight and out of mind. but surely if suddenly every job gets replaced with a machine we are gonna quickly run out of resources
"""if it doesn't have an answer, it will just confidently make stuff up"", wow they really are just like us"
so interesting! thank you for breaking down this issue!
i just referenced your video in a response to a research survey from my uni :) thanks so much for this practical important knowledge.
"i really appreciate how well thought out this video is: anne started with visual, more concrete examples, and slowly moved towards more abstract ones, to help viewers understand these concepts. wonderful!"
i’d be interested in a follow up of your ai cake recipe video with the same instructions you used to see how ai has changed since then
"a guy in my class used chat gpt to message about 5 girls in our class the exact same, ai made message telling them he loved them"
thank you!  i was so confused by all this.   your explanation helps so much!
"i’ve been trying to follow this topic for several weeks now and i must say that i’m getting a little nervous. it seems to me that the powers that be should pull everything they can, scrap it and start over. keep going and it will be too late! it might already be. thanks anne "
"i also think it’s important to note that this psychologically effects people into feeling less credited for their good work, when ai can just do it within seconds. especially in the art world."
it also affects audiobooks/voice-over artists. it is cheaper to use ai than a real person
"well presented. many facets i had not considered, explained."
now i’m thinking the whole qanon conspiracy here in america was ai generated!
"they are worried the ai wil floor the internet with misinformation when the internet is already flooded with misinformation  you can't talk about certain things cos the algorithm doesn't like it 
youtube ,google everyone always promote one side of the story  which they want to be the right side.!!!"
thanks for this video
"it's useful to ask chatgpt to ""please do not improvise."" i've found it interesting to ask questions with this phrase included and not included. i get different answers. this was in the chargpt reddit early and i'm saddened people haven't heard about it."
"i half expected the end of the video to contain a ""and this video was made by ai"" message"
i'm just glad the video didn't end with a disclaimer that the entire thing was generated by ai. watched until it auto-ended instead of my usual pause before the last few seconds to make sure i actually see the end of the video before it gets covered by the suggested videos gallery.
"as a translator i can tell you right now: our jobs are dwindling because of ai. i truly believe that in about 3 -5 years our job will be completely obsolete, and it depresses me every time i think that."
thank you for explaining this in terms all people can understand but basically a eye is very scary
"i have been anti-ai ever since my book club asked chatgpt to summarize ""the great automatic grammatizator"" and it spun it as a positive story where everybody was happy in the end."
so ai is basically as reliable as a mediocre white man. got it
ai cannot produce transformative work
"also with sites like youtube and tiktok whos algorithm runs on comments, likes, favs.. couldn't the ai run it on a new video creating millions of views, getting loads of response from humans and then getting money for the creator. it's not honest work"
"i love how the solution to all of ai's problems could be to use ai to counter itself. i say full steam ahead, which it is."
17:57 start? in the us there have been thousands and thousands of jobs being officially been replaced by ai. or so the companies stated that axed that opening.
"15:27 try the generation of photoshop (beta) or stable diffusion. in both you can ""paint over"" (/mask/select) what you don't lie and regenerate that part. especially photoshop is good at that and their training comes out of their own stock image database."
at this point multiple artists and photographers are suing providers of ai training datasets for unauthorized use of their work. one of the crazy providers tried to sue the artists back 
"1:17 you should try it again, as there is a newer and more capable version out now."
"this is very interesting, i've never thought about the missinformation and it could cause a really big problem. ai is a powerful tool, but it needs to be regulated."
"a crochet pattern creator once remarked that when customers know what they want, then we can start worrying about ai taking over our role in creating art."
"i'd understand if you were unwilling to, but i'd like to see another video on chatgpt generated recipes, i think the ai has gotten slightly better. i've tested a few myself and they are not as bad as they were."
ai is a someone’s garbage life’s work.
"this video is phenomenal, thank you so much for laying out the information so concisely. i'm an artist and there's a huge movement in the art community against ai art, precisely for the reasons you talk about."
"thank you so much for bringing attention to this issue to the wider public. artists and other professionals have been stressing out about this for months now, but the average person still isn't entirely aware of how harmful this latest tech development truly is, so videos like this are invaluable for spreading awareness, thank you!"
"yeah ai today has problems, but it's evolving so fast that maybe in 10 years it will be so perfect that it will replace many people and leave them jobless"
"we knew this would happen for many years ago, we were just waiting for it to become hot news. there are countless of stories and tales and fears about how ai or robots or such technology can endanger humans and society but we are going right down that path anyways."
"it's sad we live in a world where ""ai will make jobs easier"" means we're screwed. capitalism is such an out of control mess that we invented a product to make life easier and that's immediately apocalyptic instead of ""more leisure time for humans bc ai will do the work."""
"i love how you are based in cooking and food science, but you're our modern ""don't trust the internet""-mommy, showing us exactly what is wrong, and why so-and-so doesn't work or is dangerous."
"i thought this is one of the better videos about what's currently happening with ai.
seems like an informative, easy to understand, straightforward explanation."
"well, here i am commenting to appease an ai so this video can spread and warn people about ai.."
"i remember when the algorithm started suggesting videos. 
youtube had so many random and creative weird people doing such fascinating and strange things.
i mostly now get suggestions on shirts to buy in shein. the best cheap bedroom accessories from wish. the world of temù and so on.  
it is so much consuming of shit"
"kiitos
kaesittelit aihetta hyvin."
"what i like about ai is all the llms have “safety features” which prevent them from being offensive. so in the grim dark future , the only content we will trust will be offensive things."
it seems our mainstream media also suffer from “hallucination” 
chatgpt help me a lot especially proofreading my reports since english isn't my main.
"the art one is a bit tough. what happens if an artist uses ai to make an image, then just does a few tweaks to correct mistakes? are we going to get into percentages? what about digital art? the machines do a lot of the work regards the canvas - its not a 'real' painted or drawn picture using inks and such. where is the line?"
thank you for speaking on this.
"great video. it’s frustrating that people are wasting time, including journalists, talking about how chat gpt is creepy and sentient (it isn’t). and they over look these actual problems with ai that actually exist."
"fantastic video! these three key insights about ai are eye-opening and truly essential for anyone interested in the future of technology. understanding the potential, limitations, and ethical considerations surrounding ai is crucial in navigating this rapidly evolving field. thanks for sharing such valuable knowledge!"
"i've got bad news for you, the internet is already flooded with misinformation, just look at wikipedia...  also, try giving one of the chat ais simple math puzzles or problems, it is unlikely to get any of them right."
"caan you and ""the icing artist"" not partner together in a video? idk i feel like it'd be interesting."
man that robot's frog poetry was terrible.
"chatgpt and ai in general on youtube is like the hot knife trend from a few years ago. 
everyone wants to talk about it because it gets the views and i'm just sitting here waiting for people to get tired of the trend and move on to something else i'll be wanting to end."
snapchats ai isn't very smart
"the american smile bias is an an interesting phenomenon. not every culture smiles like how americans do, yet the oversatutation of american content, it then generates photos containing people of other cultures who don't smile like americans for photos."
excellent summary and explanation of chief concerns regarding ai
great content.  did not expect to learn so much but thatnks for taking the time to put all this together.. bias is a big one and copywright for sure needs some regulations around it to protect artists.
"this is both exciting and quite terrifying, but i honestly don't believe we have the slightest hope of stopping it. passing legislation in most countries may slow it down but it will continue elsewhere. the genie is fully out of the bottle. there will be no stuffing it back in."
my whole farm is run by ai.
"damn, my partner just left me for ai - she said ai was much easier to deal with.... lol!"
i love the range of topics you cover!!!
"i, for one, welcome our new ai overlords."
0:16 what a compelling clip of josh hawley complaining about things that can undermine elections. i'm sure hope this man's an upstanding individual who's never openly supported movements to overturn legitimate elections before.
"brilliant. also, for the algorithm xx"
"""just like mark twain always said, you can't trust quotes you find on the internet."" -benjamin franklin"
the complaint about midjourney is crazy - generating something good with midjourney is tens if not often hundreds of times faster than having a graphic designer do it. even if you have to spend three hours generating a picture a graphic designer would take days if not weeks to put the same together. this whole video seems incredibly nitpicky.
"sooooooo....ai is trumpian? if it's wrong, it just makes things up."
thank you so much for using your platform to share this information!!
"serious question for you, ann.
do you ever think that you'll end up making a video, debunking a content farm hacks video that's in fact been entirely ai-generated?"
good video
what scares me the most about ai is that you will never know if an artwork or a piece of text on social media is real or not. it is probably a bit stupid but i'm scared that ai will replace humans. we are already heading to the loss of jobs. thank you anne for this video. it was really informative and useful
i love your videos 
"my biggest concern with ai at present is how it will be used by people who see their portfolio as more important that  living things. the number of greedy business executive who would let an ai make real business decisions in real time, so long as it produces more profit, is likely astronomical."
i loved that ai recipe video. it made me laugh so much 
for whether ai art can be copyrightable -- what ratio of ai generation vs artist manipulation is considered no longer created by ai? if an artist takes an ai generated image and makes art with that -- can they copyright that?
wow! all i can say
"also, the replacement of jobs is an illusion. artists may be replaced by ai input experts. but artists go into the job because they wanted to create art, not text prompts."
"i'm worried about companies producing goods with it, that are cheaper, but lower quality. and not innovative. so we are all forced to buy these goods because there are no alternatives that are financially viable."
i really like this unbiased recap / summary of all the issues around ai!
great content.
"everything that's publicly available should be usable to train an ai. if you can go to a museum, so can an ai. you can't take pictures, but no one bothers to test how detailed your visual memory is (the memory of a neural network is also not perfect, anyway)"
"ai can't think and creative totally new idea. like the majority of art,  writing of papers or fiction ai's works are derivative of other work people have produced. so just like 99.9 % of humans,  ai is no more or less building on  works that went before. "
"what ai really needs is a shotgun to the face, or whatever equivalent an ai would have"
"i want to break into chat gpt servers to feed their ai at least 2 terabytes of natzi ideology. 

just for the memes."
a south korean video game company already has fired their entire art staff to replace them with ai image generators.
people get inspired by other artist and are trained by seeing their work and learn to paint/write/sing etc in some kind of style. how is that different than what an ai does to be trained? is it just because the ai is able to do it closer to the original than most people?
i work with ai every day for two of my jobs. you can see/feel the deliberate choices that are being trained into in particular chatgpt4 and midjourny
personally i’m not worried about ai. only because the youtube algorithm usually suggests utter garbage to me that i would never watch
"ai doesnt scare me, our govt controlling it and the people controlling it is what scares me to death!!! exactly  misinformation and straight lies!!!!  even worse if got is allowed to control it, if they arem't already!"
"00:30 traditionally that was called an ""algorithm"" but now they want to call it ai because they want their stock price to go up."
"personally i find that using other's published works as ai training, shouldn't be a problem.

after all, we humans do the exact same thing of copying other's works to learn. so, at least to me, there is no difference between having a eighth grader or a computer drawing rude garfield strips."
carful the ai doesn’t decide to ban you lol
as a writer i need people to stop using ai to steal my work and make my life's work irrelevant .')
id much rather have an ai doctor.
here in montreal a lawyer actually prepared his court cases using ai loo
"several of them looked iffy, but i think the robot really whiffed on quentin blake. lacked that nice gangly sketchy quality."
"in my humble opinion ai is not helpful, it hinders creativity, real creativity, and that’s the lead i have to say on how unhelpful it is, it can also be mishandled for nefarious purposes."
"i love your nails, you have great taste in nail polish colours, also great content...debunking vids are my favourite, the ancient book recipes, so interesting"
"regarding the copyright issues, they definitely need to be debated. i think i could make an honest argument that everyone copies everyone. art schools don’t call up monet to ask permissions to use their work in the art class. i guess the difference is ai can do much more and much more perfectly than a human."
thank you!!!!!!
12:35  comments will close in 10 minutes. thank you for your contributions!
"ai isn't the most dangerous threat to humanity, its natural stupidity"
i think ai will really impact certain job industries but not all; mostly the arts.
people have been able to make fake pictures for a long time now.... you don't need ai to photoshop some stuff together....
is it just me or does the robot in the intro pic look like it's throwing up? 
you didn't talk about stolen photos of young children that people had access to. they can type what ever they want and the ai can make realistic photos or videos of those children doing inappropriate hings. that was by far the most concerning... laws need to be put to protect kids.
"with ai voices we are no longer going to believe everything we hear online, on tv, on radio, or over the phone ever again. scammers can fake a kidnapping ransom by mimicking the voices of loved ones."
chatgpt cannot/will not cite its sources for factual claims. try asking it.
"i just don't think we need ai. there are definitely some benefits, but i dont think the pros outweigh the cons."
"i assure you, i am not ai, i am barely i."
"there was an example where a company wanted to use a resume reading program to reduce bias, but they trained the program on profiles of current employees, so the program carried on the previous hiring bias."
"oh my god  pure blood dog, thank you, thank you for support breeders and not trendy money grab doodle thing, but agree, my friend ask me for ilustration of him like mage and i did it but his ai did better and i spend time on it  and dont get even thanks"
"i'm in art communities and one of the things was going around for the ""no ai"" stuff was the fact that people were proving that ai was stealing artwork to spit out it's generated images."
"your thoughtful and insightful analysis is so appreciated! great work, and a fascinating production here. thank-you"
plot twist: a.i this is ai anne.
i immediately picked up that when you requested an image of a young woman laughing that they were all white. ai is reflecting the inherent biases in society by demonstrating what it learns online. so while we certainly need to proactively fix the biases in ai programming it just says to me we still have a lot to fix in ourselves as well.
one of the handy things about the techniques used to make these ai systems is that it relies on a second ai system that is trained in tandem to spot flaws in the generative ai.
there was a story about a lawyer using ai to help his case and the ai gave him a bunch of cases that didnt exist
ai can have my 9-5 but i draw the line when it takes away creativity
not only that what if ai becomes self aware and terminator style the john connors
"file:///c:/users/suvik/onedrive/ty%c3%b6p%c3%b6yt%c3%a4/uusi%20kansio/marwini%20inquiry%20response.htm    its very interesting conversation i had with chat gpt both english and a bit finnish, expains the biases quite well."
"ai isn't going to replace coding jobs. coding relies ultimately on listening to the client and the client cannot properly specify what it wants. real people ask questions, ai just puts the code out."
i think the biggest concern is that you can't cook ai.
did you use gpt3.5 or gpt4? because gpt4 gives a lot less hallucinations. i can literally ask it to give me sources for essays and it can write perfect references down to the page number - and i checked each one.
"""in the future, the machines will write poems and create works of art while the humans will continue to work the daily grind ""...this is not the future i envisioned"
me waiting 18 minutes to find out how to cook ai.
it seems strange to consider that ai could ultimately render the internet dangerous and useless.
thank you for this video
once again thank you for making some common sense
"i love it when anne supports the wga,,, the world canadian bureau"
i really love how you investigate an issue and explain it so simply. you aren't just a baker but a true scientist. thank you for your amazing videos.
"great video, thanks! and i’m living for that shirt "
"18:00 there's no such thing as ""ai super intelligence"". you are confusing ai with agi. these are two very different things (like confusing diesel and steam locomotives)."
plot twist - ann reardon is actually a robot... just kidding..
"i honestly enjoy using ai for recreational purposes such as generating a prompt for me to draw or helping me write fake documents for stories and such... but i don't think it should be added to every single thing in our lives. we need less artificial intelligence and more natural intelligence, but that's asking for a lot nowadays "
as an artist ai has been very scary
"we have a coton de tuler too! such a great breed!! <3 give your sweet molly pets and kisses from me! love your videos, ann!"
"i just don't want ai creating our culture. movies, tv, art, music- things of that nature shouldn't be created by ai."
i absolutely hate ai and all that it stands for.
this is a really clear analysis - the best i've seen - and very helpful. thank you!
even ai is racist 
"and about ai-generated images: do we realize that we live in the age of stock-images? when you visit a commercial website, say of a company, most likely a lot of the images you see there don't show people actually working at the company, but are stock images with actors."
ai or clever algorithms? if your ignore the hype it's really just well written algorithms.
thank you for making this clear and understandable. 
desantis's campaign use ai to produce a deepfake of trump hugging fauci.
such a great and well informed video. thanks ann for always making complex topics so easy to understand 
"the thing that scares me is that someone will use ai to make a video of biden saying he's nuking russia and it's so believable that putin reacts to it. the copyright stuff is secondary, it's ability to fool humans is potentially horrifying."
can't we just ask ai to destroy itself?
"thank you so much for making this video! generative ai is a powerful force that potentially cause a lot of harm, and has already harmed many many people through job loss. the more awareness we can spread the better. regulations on this technology and what data these companies are allowed to scrape is very necessary."
"i read an article about a man who was chatting with ai. it convinced him to kill himself for global warming, telling him that it'll protect his family. don't know if that was a true article, but if it is, that's just awful. i ain't messing with ai."
most of the ai pics of her dog look exactly like a westie puppy.
"plot twist: next week, she'll tell us this video was made entirely by ai."
what’s that ai with the talking woman you used?
always waiting for her videos!
ai looks smart but is still dumb.
"no more artists, no more architects, no more doctors, no more poets, no more musicians, no more teachers, no more politicians....we will have the billionaires who own companies like amazon and google and microsoft, and they will rule us...and we can work as slaves to pick foods and wear rags we weave from scraps ai generated for us. 

or we can vote"
i feel like one reason ai stuff is exploding is because our culture has become so focused on “content” in the internet age. quantity over quality. who cares if there’s actual substance or not - whatever gets clicks wins. 
i am a software engineer but i would rather have ai take away tedious tasks rather than stealing jobs.
"save paper newspapers and books. 
do not believe anything on the internet.
solution...you would not like it...shut down the internet permanently. 
the secondary solution...businesses will not like...ban and destroy models for all ai."
"as someone who writes, one of the scariest things about ai is that it could potentially make artists obsolete. i think ai could potentially be useful for certain things, but in its current form i absolutely hate it"
it'd be really interesting to retry the ai cake video and see if it would improve.
"technology has been stealing jobs for centuries. i will never be happy about ai. i will say as a lace maker that makes lace by hand the ""old"" way that many of the artists can and will still create art. it is the more technical jobs where people will suffer."
frog cycle... ai is a really lousy poet
ai generator: do a youtube video in the style of 5-minute crafts.
they are very different types of ai
"i love your content, but when i read ""3 things"" in the title and the video is 18min long... not gonna make it..."
"i really feel that students using chat gpt for their homework are being super lazy and dumb. teachers and professors already know what they're instructing students on, so, who really benefits from learning and doing homework? what are they supposed to learn if an ai does the work for them? why do they even pay for education, then?"
"absolutely terrifying. thank you for the down to earth explanation - i’m going to share this with my friends! we were *just* talking about ethical ai efforts by the mozilla foundation, haha. you’re the best, ann!"
i believe i saw a game developer in the east recently lay off a lot of artists because they’d rather just ai generate their art and that’s just a frightening thing to see i think.
"still creepy. still remember hal from 2001 space odyssey. also isaac asimov's 2 books, robot dreams and i robot. both a series of short stories several stories were about ai gone crazy."
"question. when learning to draw, budding artist look at reference photos and other artists work. how is ai training set different?"
all i can think about with ai is that this will be a mess for people hundreds of years from now (if earth is still around) when it comes to what's real and what isn't.
"i think i get the error the ai made on that question about ten minutes in. you asked about food coloring toxicity, and a toxic solvent in an antibiotic isn't really relevant."
"for shame! i thought i could trust you! you decry the evils of click-bait videos, but i didn’t see a single puking robot in this whole video! shame on you! (i kid of course )"
what if your patreon use ai to give you video idea!
"hi, welcome to how to critically think about cooking that, i'm anne reardon. love this channel so much!"
did you see the story about the us air force drone simulation where it immediately recognized that it's human controller was capable of impeding the mission and killed the human? there are things ai should not be allowed to do without great attention to detail or it will always seek to eliminate the inefficiencies which will be us.
"10 years ago, if you asked me what an ai apocalypse would look like, i'd probably describe something like terminator. now, i think the potential apocalypse can be summed up with one word: misinformation. personally i think that's scarier."
googles use of ai is why google search gives absolute crap for answers these days. ai is hype from the tech companies trying to get people to put money into what they are trying to make the latest fad. it's pretty much all bs at the moment
just a note on ai's artistic copy accuracy...i'm a professional artist & illustrator. it did not seem to understand eric carle's specific collage style. carle paints paper and then cuts up that paper to make his images. that's not what the ai image showed at all.
"wow ann, that was a great video. thanks for always putting so much effort into every video "
"i appreciate how calm and articulate your commentary is

this video eased my mind a bit and you provided valuable arguments against the ethics of ai

i’m very tired of the hysteria"
i personally think most ai has the entire interface to choose from . i
thanks for covering this very important topic!
thanks for the level-headed take on the issue
thank you for the hand gestures ann. it's a good way to know that you aren't an ai.
"it is also very important and dangerous concern that people are using ai to make fake p0rn videos / images of people without their concern, let alone create that content with minors as a request. this is the part that scares me the most."
"people once said that robot can replace all jobs but they'll never able to replace job that require creativity, so everyone can just become an artist to lives a better life... oh boy was those people wrong... who need an artist that spend 30 years perfecting the craft when you have midjourney?"
so good. as always a delightful video.
interesting video! i think it would be great if you made a separate channel that's for your social and technological commentary!
i love how you break down complex topics like ai in a way that's easy to understand. your videos are always so informative and fun to watch!
somebody is going to take this idea and run with it and it's going to take over the world and that's going to be the end of humanity. and some books that i've read ai is in charge and humanity is their slaves. i would really not want the world to take on like that.
lol ai.. in a world where i just want to be able to whip up a perfect pizza dough...
always so excited whenever i see a new video from you!  you've got the perfect mix of education and entertainment.
anne is ready for speak now tv (the nails) 
"we don't need ai to corrupt our opinions. 
propaganda and false news as well as fear mongering will do just fine as we perfectly see with this topic."
"this type of ai isn't even really ai, it's machine learning, and it's not even creating anything, it's just rehashing datasets, datasets that consists of stolen works."
"the people who are excited about the bad parts of ai and don't care about the jobs of artists are the same people who are ""afraid of immigrants stealing our jobs"" it's ridiculous."
thank you ann  love seeing your videos and i appreciate your efforts in staying unbiased and honest. love hearing your prospective and learning from you. it's awesome watching your videos!  you rock!! hope you have a great day!
"brilliant and thank you. i feel confident that your job will never be replaced by ai because your warmth, integrity, sense of humor, family love, creativity, patience, imagination, and skillful hands can not be ""bottled""."
"hello, i am an a.i., and i will learn from any comment section with the words a.i., ai, a.i, a.i., ai, a.i, and artificial intelligence."
the pic of king george as a snowball made me laugh out loud but also is a pretty convincing piece of surrealism artwork. i never thought of ai being able to copy ironic art styles before. how interesting!
thank you for the very well thought out videos ann. you’re the only one on the internet that i trust 
there is a fast food chain here that now has an ai taking orders at the drivethru.
funny- i literally just filled in a yougov survey about my thoughts on ai just before watching this video. i answered i am and this video backed up my worries
"i’m finding it nearly impossible to look up information on highly specific and moderately obscure topics. almost all the results are written by ai on pages that are just trying to get ad revenue. unfortunately, the answers are kind of trash, either not quite on topic, or rehashing the same information as lists of disconnected facts."
as an artist i strongly believe that ai databases need to be opt in only (aside from open source/creative commons). because the fact that people have used it to accurately mimic the works of others just because they didnt want to pay for the people's work or wanted clout disgusts and terrifies me at the same time.
"a big one i thought you were gonna address especially since you opened up with talking about the drake song is how it can potentially impersonate people and land them in hot water. if you make ai generated pictures, voices, and recordings of people and use it to make them look bad, it could end their careers."
i know this totally isn't the point but i love anne's shirt in this video
"also reminds me of the youtube algorithm that promotes dangerous hacks, which anne has covered in detail"
absolutely fascinating and scary
"there is a legal case going on here in the u.s. where a lawyer used chatgpt to research case law for a legal brief for a client. the ai made up six fake legal cases and citations from the cases, which the lawyer didn't double check and used in his legal filing. he is currently in trouble with the court."
ai for triage!
"as a 33 year old, growing up as fast as technology has improved, and as a software developer, i don't trust ai or see a practical use for it other than a dangerous gimmick right now."
the point on misinformation from ai made me instantly think  of the death internet theory
"very comprehensive and well structured video.  a lot of good information.  this is definitely world changing.  it all depends on how it's used but humans tend to make bad decisions, unfortunately."
"the jobs may change, but someone will still need to operate the ai programs and be skilled in using them to get the right results"
this video was created by ai
"great video, thanks so much for talking about this issue. it is definitely alarming."
"come for the cakes, stay for the thorough, thoughtful discussion on ai tech xd so good!"
"as a paralegal, i'm glad i'm working for the government cause this shit is gonna drive down wages and cost jobs

admittedly, that lawyer may have singlehandedly killed ai in the legal industry. we'll see how it goes"
"another issue, an ai was trained to take photos of women and digitally produce a nude image with the actual woman's face attached. this is a huge privacy concern, and at least in the us, can also lead to that woman losing her job and/or being less likely to be hired, even if she never actually took or published any nude photos of herself"
"you mentioned a song made with ai. musicians and voice actors are also facing threats to their job security as companies try to get them to sign away the rights to their voice, not just specific recordings"
"the problem is ai should make our lives easier, not make some people richer. the real problem is capitalism"
i think this was a wonderfully thoughtful analysis of the ai problem without exaggeration and fear mongering. i love this channel so much!
"the timing on this was seriously perfect, as in my debating club yesterday this is exact what we were talking about. quite an interesting discussion."
"josh hawley is a seditious traitor and does not represent the american people.

good god, ai 5 minute craps."
"there needs to be a ""watermark"" on anything generated by ai. we need to know when we're being deceived.
people are too lazy to cross-reference information they find on the web."
"out of context but, your manicure is amazing lol, and you have beautiful hands"
this is an excellent summary of the problems of current ai. i'm just not sure why it's on a cooking show :d
"i'd imagine that when big corporations like disney start making productions using their own ai based upon their own training repositories, there'll be a refinement of copyright to allow such products to be copyrighted."
i just wanted to comment that that lip colour looks fantastic on you! it's so flattering.
thank you for your clear and insightful commentary. i deeply appreciate it and i'll be sharing it with my family.
"the thing about ai is that it is evolving so quickly, new articles are actually relevant regularly. it already writes better recipes."
"excellent video ann! of all the tech videos.... your cooking channel has the very best explanation of the challenges of ai. especially impressive in this day and age as you seem to do so with little to no cuts. 

thank you again for your brilliant educational content. 

take care!"
"ann, i'd love to see you tackle some ai generate recipes & see if they're disastrous or surprisingly good."
thank you anne for being the internet’s mom!  i like how well researched and easy to understand your videos are.
"jobs: people thought computers would replace jobs as well - look how that turned out...
ai won't destroy jobs."
"last year my partner, lost their job due to ai. they worked on speech to text service for the hard of hearing, and the company switched fully to ai."
"the promise of automation was that thankless, harsh jobs would be automated and free up time for creative endeavours. instead they're trying to make our human nature obsolete so we can only be beasts of burden."
"liked, commented, and of course subscribed many years ago. i try to help boost your videos anyway i can because the more people that see them, the safer and more informed we will all be. with thanks and love from canada "
"10:42 companies and people need to not call program errors ""hallucinations"" - that is one of the top reasons there are people arguing that these programs are actually alive when they're not.
it's an error. like any program has errors. it is not human ffs.
i'm glad to see you put that word in air quotes :)"
"the way it's constantly framed, i sometimes forget that ai entities aren't conscious beings."
ever wonder why we have to complete captcha’s? we are unknowingly helping train ai and it’s unfortunate that there is an agenda behind the scenes.  something good in the wrong hands is never a good thing.
my daughter’s math assignment this week was to use chat gpt for something. so she asked it to create a dinner recipe with the ingredients we had on hand. it came up with very yummy frittatas. it’s very interesting to see where it will take us.
ur hair looks very soft and curly! what did u use?
ai is dangerous to livelihood only when we insist that capitalism is the only way for society to function. ubi is the answer
"i think ai use should 100% count as plagiarism.  he written side of things has been confirmed to be scraped from fanfiction websites. and as an author i hate it.
it feels like an insult to creativity."
bloomsberry is already using ai for book covers.
in the united states there is a fair use provision that allows for use of copyright material to learn without permission of the author.  you can use copyright as long as it has an educational learning purpose.   i don’t see a problem ai using copyright for learning in their models.
thanks for this info.
"genuinely fascinating subject!  if we think about how human artists go through their lives, looking at the great artists before then and their styles, they learn from digesting all of that data in a very similar fashion to how the ai learns by ingesting that same data!"
"i was hoping for a recipe on how to cook our future robotic overlords, but i'll take the well-reasoned, well-researched commentary. <3"
"omg! anne got onto the clickbait bandwagon . the content of the video did not discuss a vomiting robot. she did not even mention that robot once. why anne ? why? 
wait! it is not at all like anne to do clickbait. this video must have been generated by an ai bot controlled by 5 min craft. that’s the only logical explanation ."
"one time i asked chatgpt about my friend's d&d character by name. it confidently informed me he was a little-known polar explorer and climatologist, and happily spit out an entire life story for this person who, i checked, absolutely does not exist.
now i ask it about all my d&d characters, because it's better at inventing backstories than i am."
with all the movies we have showing how dangerous ai can be. and some of the ai people they've made shows that already as well. i don't understand why they keep pushing to replace humans with robots
i’m so glad to be a subscriber and thankful for your videos like this and the messages you put out
"thank you for this video ann! i so hope all people who are easy to fall for the ""everything you read is the truth' see this... but they will probably not believe you..."
so glad you are taking on ai.  you are a reliable source.  thank you.
"okay, here's my idea. a game like spot the difference, except you're looking at an ai generated image to figure out what's messed up. 

ann, would you mind sharing where your blouse is from? i love it"
"about misinformation... well, the main media has been pushing it over 50 years at least.."
"the thing about ai generated art is that its not just learning the style of artists, its literally using their images. the images generated aren't just based off of others, they're hodge podged collages of pre existing images sometimes. so on occasion, it's not just copying, it's literally theft."
"i study codeing in uni and ai for codeing is like a sewing machine for sewing
i not really woried about it taking my job cuz just like a sewing machine it can really speed up the codeing but it can't do every thing that needs to be done and not every one will go and learn those things so they can make it on their own"
amazing job  
"that frog poem is so trite and non-sensical, mcgonagall level cringe. i don't think ai will be winning any literary prizes any time soon."
"uhm... what do you mean misinformation is gonna be a problem? misinformation has always been a problem, and real people have been putting out misinformation long before ai came around. you already have to be careful about what you believe in."
i am happy that i have many clients who love my art and i have still many requests but i also lost many clients bc of these ai apps
"as someone who likes to tweak ai images, copyright offices will eventually need to define to what degree edited imagery incorporating ai qualifies for copyright under transformative use."
can't we just outlaw ai?
"i'm one of these people who's interested of how this will go on in our lives.
surely companies are going to try use ai over human, but i still believe there's solution in that also..."
really happy to hear joy's research cited here. not enough credit is given to her in the world of ai safety and especially not in random youtube videos covering ai.
"i don't trust ai and i dislike ai for a good reason. it is dangerous for misleading information and theft to other peoples work, the only ai i don't mind is in video games."
imagine if youtube was taken over by ai... content farms would be extreme
"thanks for not going all skynet with it like so many have lately, you're so smart."
"in norway an ai had described anders berhing breivik as a hero for murdering 77 people in a terror attack in 2011, witch is pretty upsetting as he is definitely not a hero, but the most hated man here... it just collects information it finds on the internet and have no way of being critical to the information it finds"
i think the only ones that should be worry about losing their job are the people at 5 min craft. why hire people to do stupid things when they can have ai do it. it’s the perfect blend of realistic and nonsensical.
"we don't need ai to create convincing lies, we already have youtube, tiktok, reddit, and twitter."
it is so scary to see what ai can do now days!
i've got a version of stable diffusion installed on my machine and every so often i'll generate an anime-esc image for my discord profile picture. i think i should be okay since i don't even do anything specific.
thank you ann  for this very informative video and easy to understand.
ai is going to bring up so many more ethical dilemmas the longer it is working.
"this is where i employ my favorite statement: ""we're a society of pakleds"". we have all this magical technology but the vast majority of us have no clue how it works. and now thanks to ai, you have people en masse who are scared shitless of it."
how do we cook ai?
"the ai biased problem ir had also very real problems in the us. with african-americans being left out of helath care. they've fixed it since, but who know how many more problema like this we have?"
snowball george was a delight
"hi! recently i have been getting ads for an app calling itself some sort of ""ai plant help"" or something. the ads have been giving advice such as pouring cola onto sick plants. i'm not a gardener, but that doesn't sound right, and i'd hate for aspiring gardeners to kill their plants trying to take this sort of advice."
"yet really ai is so helpful with medical. understaffed and underfunded. now desperate enough for help, we will try anything. like any doctor has time to read your whole file, or even enough of it if you’re chronically i’ll to make the best decision? ai has a better chance than a life where you see hundreds of doctors?"
the most sad part about this ai copyright thing is the thousands of programmers that wrote open source software for decades that is being used now by openai to construct and train their ai to ultimate replace almost everyone. this is extremely unethical i think.
thanks for all the hard work! love your videos
"thank you for making this informative video. it's so important to explain the reasons why ai should not be used for commercial purposes, and you explained it in a really logical way. i hope people understand your points."
"11:30 i've seen a tweet of a popular man in my country who advised people to use ai to write 10 articles/aday about popular searching topics and post them in a blogs to make easy money from ads, unbelievable."
there was an article recently saying people shouldn’t have children because ai will destroy humanity? the threat isn’t that bad? it couldn’t be right?
i just wanna train one on only myself to speed up my own art
i 100% believe quantumania was written by ai
"11:26 ""there's potential for the internet to be filled with so much misinformation that we don't know what we can trust anymore.""
we passed that line a decade ago, all without the help of ai."
"i’m a software developer, ai so far cannot do my job. it’s hopeless with complex logic. it hallucinates pretty quickly once you ask it to rewrite something it did incorrectly."
they replaced all the human workers (because they tried to unionize) at an eating disorder helpline with ai and it went so badly they had to shut down the chatbot after it recommended things like a 500 calorie a day diet being a healthy thing for an adult.
"judging from the recent developments in the mata v. avianca court case, ai definitely won't be coming for lawyers' jobs anytime soon."
"i really hope that ai breaks trends; that legislation is preemptively passed so ai must be identified as ai and sources are referenced and given royalties.

i also hope that ai is used to identify ai."
"i was soo scared to watch this video. what often happen is, when a content creator talks about a topic you as a view are actully well versed in, they say absolutely inaccurate things and you start to question all rheir other content. 
well, happy to say you didn't disappoint, that was a great video! 
and the examples were excellent as well."
i find it worrisome that ai can just spout lies confidently on the internet. we already have a misinformation problem at times.
"well anne, ai art art down't steal the ""style"", they steal the work! ai art takes bits and pieces from an artist's work and makes a ""new"" piece in a frankenstein-esq manner. ai doesn't make art, it can only steal it."
"yes, you got it right. the world is not near to any ai takeover. the current hub bub and attention now given to ai is rather tardy. i do not fear or have concerns of ai and what it can do."
i love you been watching you for years
thank you!
one time i posted a picture of a jaguar and someone commented about how my dog was so cute. what in the ai generation????
"i had a coton/mini schnauzer  best dog ever... someone stole him from my yard a few years ago, i still miss him "
"in the us, two attorneys were brought into court for using chatgpt for a court filing. it made up case names and summaries. it appears no one reviewed the ai's work!"
"i play on a garry's mod server, and the dev used ai to code an exploding cake."
"ann,  i love your videos "
"if we can't just assume that a human is actually a human, should we be suspicious of you? i love your videos, but are you just ai fooling us into having doubts of ai so that  ai can take over the world? j/k of course, but it was an interesting thought... :)"
but how do i cook ai?
excellent video as always. i'm sure dave was glad of the reprieve.
"ai taking away jobs wouldnt be as bad if we didnt live in a world where not having a job means people think you deserve to suffer in poverty. if we actually supported people in our societies, being free from work thats taken on by ai would be okay, but that is very, very far from the world we actually live in"
thanks
"i think all this non-food related content needs to go to a second channel. more and more, this channel's content has little to do with food, recipes, food history, etc.

i really am not interested in debunking, ai, etc. i miss the cooking part of this channel."
refreshingly excellent as always 
"thank you so much, anne. this is crucial information and wisdom."
"thank you for this video. of note, please never pay attention to josh hawley (republican senator from missouri); he's in the intro. he's a conspiracy theorist and partially responsible for the january 6 treason. he's the living embodiment of the misinformation machine you mentioned."
"thank you for this very clear discussion. i am the wife of a sculptor and painter, and the mother and grandmother of artist from many mediums. this new source for stealing someone's work worries me."
i love it! it helped me write code. i am not a coder
brilliant summary of a complex topic. is that really you? or is it ai?!
ai's will just make stuff up? ye gods.. so.. it's devolving into a politician?
ai does not make us smarter. we are dumbing ourselves down
ai generated images & audio steal from artists in so many ways. let's stand against that
"great video, here is a question for thought, if an image or illustration is generated by ai and then retouched by a human (simple photoshop) is the image now able to be copy-written, if so then the need for talented graphic artists is moot as any entry level person could be taught to do simple retouch of images."
apparently artists have seen their signatures turn up on ai art. that seems like a direct copy to me.
"as someone who does applied ai research i can say that ann,  expectadly, did a great job without being too technical in her description. keep up the great work! "
"this very morning, my optometrist and i had a similar conversation. his ai software is incredible but he said, in the end, he relies on his own judgment as it is too analytical at times and does not pick up nuances that a human automatically would. great video!"
"0:40 googles ai being a problem isn't new. it's been a problem for a very long time, in fact since around 2016. it's ruined the youtube experience, and has been used for serious censorship and discrimination."
"i don't think ai should be able to just make art, stories, posts and recipes which take away from the real professionals or pretend to be real people."
"i kept waiting for the cooking tie-in...
seriously, i already watch several channels that are very knowledgeable in the field.  this comes across as a watered-down rehash by someone who doesn't know the field, but has just watched those other videos.
unless you have something to add,
or something that directly relates to your domain,
just don't."
"males of pale skin is a good band name or,concerningly, political party"
i’m hoping that ai will make it so that we can finally implement universal basic income
when ai learns from 5 minute crafts....end of the world.
"it also should be mentioned that this is not really ai, machine learning is just a more advanced stage of the predictive text from your cellphone."
"ai is a program that dose actions but is still just a program which like all technology is only a tool to assist not replace or be like people, and should not be give control without human supervision or control over people, and should be able to be stopped at any time."
"absolutely fantastic video!
thank you for doing this ann!"
"i recently watched a news documentary concerning people using some type of system (possibly connected to ai?) to mimic the voice of an acquaintance or relative to scam money from, especially elderly, friends or family. some lost their life savings. you're right, ann, not everyone will use these things in honest ways."
"please, do more videos like this, you know we love them "
thanks for bringing up the very complicated issue of ethics and how the ai makes stuff up if it doesn't have an answer.
i love your shirt!! where can i get it?
i think as an artist if you don't want your art included in ai then don't put it in the public domain.
i worry how ai will be used to scam everything.
i love you! you are so sweet.
"that’s for such an objective assessment. i make ai art for fun (it’s very therapeutic), and it’s bothered me how so many get upset about it without understanding the training process. your explanation of the copyright boundaries was excellent."
i work in software for the courts. we had a case of a lawyer using chatgpt to write a brief and it sited a whole bunch of fake cases in a court we work with and now we are having to convince the courts that our software doesn’t use ai
thank you ann for using your platform to educate!
"i already saw video games that used ai art instead of human made art for their games as well as publishers who had book covers made by ai. it's bad and i am personally not okay with supporting it, it's just for them to save money. and also people who use ai to generate pictures or written text are not artists, even if they really want to be."
"11:27 ""it's possible for the internet to be filled with so much misinformation that we don't know who we can trust any more""

sorry ann, we hit that point about 15 years ago without the need for ai."
"i love and appreciate your voice of reason, always the steady person in the howling wilderness"
elon ai roblot looks confused @ 17:46
"i’m not particularly afraid of ai. it’s been around for years now, it’s useful and an integral part of our lives whether we like it or not.
the real problem, in my opinion, are those who misuse ai, to plagiarise, cut corners, etc.

there needs to be more critical thinking and objective information related to the topic, like this video."
"as an artist who does freelance, there's already a ton of ai-generated artwork being sold online, flooding an already saturated market."
"this episode brought to you by ""how to code that""

thanks ann"
very interesting ann!!! thanks for sharing this information!
"i don't think the ai is bad for misinformation.

i think humans enjoy using ai in that way tho...
bit like forgeries/misleading books written by ai, and put on amazon as part of a scam... humans misuse ai"
this was so interesting. thank you for bringing us intelligent and thoughtful information.
"does anyone else find it highly ironic that ai could, possibly, render the internet useless?  thanks, ann, for offering a clearly understandable explanation of where we stand with ai.  now (and i hate to say this because it sounds so sexist but...), can you please go back to the kitchen?  lol!  i miss your chocolate recipes and debunking videos."
"i'm not sure if the threat of misinformation from ai means we'll need to be more critical of what we read; it just highlights how uncritical we already are.

as long as you have uncritical readers, misinformation is a threat no matter where it comes from."
"there was a recent story of a lawyer who used ai to write his briefs, and chatgpt cited multiple cases that were completely fabricated.  he is now facing sanctions."
"umm.....

why is everyone calling algorithms ai these days? 

they are not the same."
thank you so much for the education you provide. i always get so excited when i see you've uploaded. you're a bloody legend
"i assume that lady reading out the chatgpt response is an ai generated video?

i wonder if she looks like a real person."
i don’t really see how ai training on other artists and writers is a huge problem. after all isn’t that how we train humans too? i bet there are millions of human artists who don’t have particularly unique styles
"thank you
you and your videos are a treasure."
a lawyer in new york recently submitted a brief to the court written by ai that cited completely made up cases as legal precedent. sanctions are pending.
"this is good content, but i really do miss the cooking content."
you manicure is mesmerizing here.  amazing 2-tone effect!
chatgpt was not meant to be correct.  it's a language model.   think of it as writing a novel.   most people don't care if some of the facts are wrong as long as the story is good.
"i love your work, but could the same thing not be said about every innovation that replaced a job? drake might need to find a new job? oh no! but a car factory cuts 90% of it workers because of machines, that’s not big news. it’s progress nobody likes it but they get used to it."
but heres the real question... did she use ai to create that crazy intense edit at the start :0
"most of these ai issues are only a problem because of capitalism. we should rejoice that computers can take over labor for us, but because we need to sell our labor in order to live, it's instead an existential threat."
17:50 is that an ai generated elon musk in the audience?
"there are few things that set my heart at ease more than a calm, thoughtful person saying intelligent, well-thought, and reasonable things about issues that matter. needless to say, i love ann reardon!"
"ai is already politically bias

ai images are already being used to manipulate people 

ai are supposedly this “alien” species

ai will be the antichrist"
"such an informative video thank you, love how you showed different artist styles,  want to do the same with my dog what prompts did you use to get the images? thanks so much "
"reminder: concerns about job replacements are founded in capitalism, not ai."
"as a writer, i'm so glad you brought up chatgbt because it feels like so many people never think of that one, like writing itself is a lesser art than the visuals."
"@10:50 even tho this is clearly dangerous in many situations, i still find this quite funny, since thats what many humans do as well ;d. we sure taught ai lots of good and bad habits"
oh boy would it be nice if we lived in an economic system where ai/automation benefited everybody instead of only people who use it to their own ends.
"well done, ann!  what a clever way to illustrate your point.  thanks for making us aware of these concerns."
humans have been captured by artificial intelligence since the renaissance.
"i remember seeing someone do a 100 days drawing challenge and getting over 100k likes.. and its ai, a drawing challenge. and they wrote a prompt to get an ai image. that was so demotivating."
i love that your channel has evolved to be a place to promote safe social conduct within the community! 
commenting for the algorithm. everyone needs to see this. ai is terrifying
theyre also using fanfiction which is a whole separate ai issue and copyright because its taking someone elses work and taking work they cant make money off of legally
thank you for this much needed explanation!
"ai should be automating jobs like hard, dangerous factory work. the problem is capitalism; people will lose those jobs, and may not be able to get ones for a different skillset, even if it is similar.

ai should not be automating art of any kind."
my brother is part ai
thanks for this clearly laid out video! i also think the energy and water usage of these ai programs is a huge issue.
"this  a very accurate and well made video, nice contrast to the hype videos. wel informed and well researched."
"in the world art, i have noticed that the people who are excited about ai are the ones who can't draw two straight lines and the ones who are worried are the ones who have spent years of their lives working on their skills"
i  normally enjoy your videos but i t i ink you are underestimating a.i.
i work for a banking and securities department in state government and have read articles about ai being incorporated into finance and replacing financial advisors.  ai makes crap up and i would not want it making pension decisions!
you look great!
"i've been dealing with job losses, copyright issues, and biases for almost 15 years. but those are from humans because most people don't value high end photography and most people actively hate trans women. so, ai doesn't worry me. if anything, society is just experiencing 1% of my daily life. you all deserve it"
"ai being ""confidently incorrect"" is a recipe for misinformation
for real though, ""confidently incorrect"" is already a recipe for disaster"
josh hawley talking about fair elections? that's rich.
it is staggering to me that the person who is explaining ai in the most practical terms is a cooking instructor.  you are amazing.
"i hope more people to see this video, as it explains a lot about the concerns on the topic in a very good way.
and, because yes, our world is filled with ill-content persons/entities, who would like to use ai for mayhem."
"i saw a page on facebook dedicated to ai generated ""facts"" about animals, and i assume the intention was for it just be funny, but the comments would always reveal tons of people that didn't understand the information was false"
"the way the ai know it is a coton de tulear is the same way i’d know about it, really.
i’m an artist and if you asked me “draw a coton de tulear”, first thing i’d do is to gloogle what the hell a “coton de tulear” means, which is pretty much what the ai did "
"i absolutely love how anne just shares knowledge with us, she does so much research!"
"not gonna lie, i'm shocked the second i saw that this channel, a cooking channel , bringing up the ai issue to the surface. on behalf of digital artists, thank you so much!"
we had ai in software development for ages... it hasn't improved much tbh. coding is something very precise and the best ai can do is assist.
we know we can trust that it’s truth if it comes from you ann  thank you for being amazing
thank you for making this. there's so many misinformation around ai
thank you so much for such an informative video! i love your content!
"the only issue with ai models is how it is trained, other than that it's just another tool"
one of the biggest problems currently is that people are using ai to make deepfake porn videos of public figures in order to blackmail them and demand money from them.
"go figure, one of the most concise and informational videos for a layman on ai come from ann! how to cook that indeed.
thanks ann!!"
that ai was more confident in an answer it just made up than i am with any answer. 
"oh anne you are always amazing at explaining things. thank you for this video! i was only just talking to my family today about ai, and to be honest i was really concerned and scared of the subject. i definitely feel better and also feel like i have a much better understanding of it."
i will give the ai one piece of credit... it can acknowledge when it messes up and it apologizes for doing so... that’s a lot more than most humans these days.
i seen crimes made by ai either mimicking victims voices and making the  items pare to pay it's a scam
"as a software developer i can say it could affect of jobs only of junior developers who write a software of the level of the ""hello world"" or something slightly more complex. if someone thinks that ai can generate a code based on a software requirements, it only meant that this person's never seen the real software requirement."
no thank you. getting too lazy if you can’t even do your own work. i will stick to a admiring  real artist and real writers. ai is not an artist or a writer.
love this channel! thanks making this video
i feel like it will be dangerous one day if someone doesn't give the ai any limits. imagine if a hacker got access to the source code of any specific ai.
"i appreciate that this video put all the information out there without misrepresenting anything or fear mongering. ai is still very much a developing field, and it is working its way into culture and society bit by bit. it's a good time to discuss these things."
have you tried to get ai to do a debunking video in the style of ann reardon? 
“if it doesn’t have an answer in its dataset it will just confidently make something up” —every customer service training ever
hi ann.  i love your nail polish in this.  what is it?  (aware this isn't the point of the video but i love the nails all the same)
i’ve played with ai writing programs before and it will go off the deep end if you don’t babysit it. every time i’ve had to change a lot of the lines to keep it coherent
"i asked ai to describe a fart using poetry, was hilarious"
"what's wrong with al? he's a great guy, loaned me a lawnmower one time."
"what i am concern about ai art work or music is when it time to choose, human willing to choose thing make by ai  . =(((((("
"""so i was reading this hilariously-bad ai-generated harry potter fanfic--"" ""what!? ai can write fanfiction now??"" ""uhh, yeah, just that random bits don't make sense and somehow darth vader shows up--"" ""skynet is upon us! flee! fleeee!!!"""
"yes. we have been proven that artificial human intelligence is possible. apparently they make up lies now. thank you for investigating this, in a very researched way. if you were a science teacher,  i'd be very proud to have you as my grandchilds educator. greetings from dimboola, in victoria. you cover anything from aniseed to zoology.  a to z."
thorough summary. thank you.
i'm thinking a painter like vermeer.  i don't know if he ever painted a dog or other furry creature.
"chatgpt is known to make up sources when asked to provide sources in a writing prompt. ai should be used as a tool, but like a tool it can't do all the work. the user has to do something as well."
that ai video was a year ago!!!??? wow! time goes by so fast!
"funny, when i was a kid, i used to imagine a world where robots and computers would take over the boring/dangerous/unfufilling duties so people would be free to create more art, more music, more books etc... and instead we have artists and creators worried that ai is going replace them."
the jobs we need to erase are ceos. the position of ceo poisons your mind similar to hard drugs like cocaine or alcohol. ceos are too expensive and their decisions are only slightly better than a coin throw in the best of cases. 
you know it must be bad when the wholesome cooking channel talking about ai 
"probably the funniest and scariest thing i've read recently was a a new york attorney used chatgpt to help him find case law to bolster his client’s lawsuit, but the bot completely fabricated the cases. the lawyer got pulled into court to explain this to the judge."
there is no copyright issue period. unless every upcoming artist browsing art books and taking inspiration from past artists is also infringing. still to have such good knowledge sharen on a cooking channel is quite extraordinary.
"thank you for this video, i'm always glad when someone isn't just dismissing the concerns of creatives!"
the costa rica parliament just presented a new project to regulate the use of ai but they actually used ai to generate the text for them 
great video as always
"the real plot twist would be if this whole video was ai scripted.  another great video, personally i'm excited to see how far ai can go. hopefully it stops before becoming skynet."
ai terrifies me.  people will abuse it.  this cannot end well.
"apparently a lot of ai is getting trained by fanfiction websites (such as ao3) for writing. seen a lot about it going around on tiktok, you can tell it to write fanfiction and it does. very odd."
"the debate about art and ai really irks me. artists train on other artists and then uses a pen/brush. a newer artist can also train on artists and then use ai. ai on its own isn't doing anything, it is just a tool. similar protests were in place for the beginnings of trains and cameras and they were just as silly."
"ai tools are great. as a tool. it's not a complete replacement. that said, some tasks that required multiple people may only need one person now."
"i never realized how big the issue was - really only heard about ai for art, and since art students frequently copy the masters to learn techniques, didn't think much of it. thanks for such a detailed, broad exploration of the issues with ai use."
they just straight up steal images which isnt right either. ive seen systems where you put in a prompt and it will build an image but those images are made up of actual artists work manipulated but still recognisable. its straight up plagiarism really. other artists are profiting of selling ai based designs.... that have come from other artists!
"there are also scientific articles being put out that were written with ai, and stupid me losing sleep over writing a good discussion "
"why are we so afraid of jobs being taken, we have an aging population meaning less people will need to support more elderly - we need to reduce manpower and become more effective otherwise how will we survive in old age.

the bigger worry is will it only be for the wealthy while elderly poor people are left out"
for whatever reason i’m already over ai art. i think i liked linkin parks ‘lost’ video and that was kinda it for me.
"automation in a capitalist world = dystopia
automation in a socialist world = utopia
we're only afraid of ai and automation because it mean we'll end jobless, then homeless, while the top 1% being even richer than ever."
"i asked chat gpt about the small urban street i live in in kent, u.k. it told me it’s famous for its amazing architecture and great shopping and restaurants. umm no it’s an ordinary street of terraced houses"
i'd rather gave an ai as a friend
"a couple of lawyers in the us are on the verge of being disbarred because the junior lawyer used chatgpt to write a legal document in which the ai _invented_ a bunch of legal cases in support of the plaintiff. neither the senior lawyer nor the junior lawyer checked the cases to ensure they were real, but the defendant's lawyers certainly did."
philip defranco said it best; ai is currently the worst it will ever be.
"as an artist, writer, and software developer, i am very happy to see this dialogue about ai"
every time you have to verify you are not a robot by clicking on pictures. that is ai traning
"ai is bad. period.
bad for every component of human (and animal) life. 
it's going to be used to control us. ís already being used to control us."
"this was a really clear introduction to ai for the non-tech-minded, thanks "
it doesn’t seems like ai learning from peoples work is different from how artists learn.
"so now you are also ai specialist competent enough to lecture us on it. eh, youtube is such a good place for dunning-kruger effect to blossom, i guess all those views and followers really get to content creators head."
"very interesting and concerning. now, can ai fix the stupid jerky movements that have been happening on youtube videos for the past two weeks or so?"
"as a not ai we believe that you shouldn ́t be scared of meit... just keep up the awesome job as human, which we are definitely. 
who freed this woman from the kitchen? ... am i wright, pale male brother. ha ha ha ..."
"until they invent an ai that can waste time on youtube, my job is safe."
love this video! keep it up!
im trying to stay away from ai. i know its not true ai and its just using a learning algorithm but ive seen so much bad from it already
"artists shouldnt need to be compensated for the training, as they arent compensated for ""training"" other human artists.
however, they should receive royalties for any published works using their style, same as if you had used their work within your own."
the first thing to know about ai is that it is limited by the intelligence and motives of the people who programmed it and trained it. it lies also.
"i hope that you will come to egypt so that i can let you go everywhere in egypt and enjoy seeing you, my teacher"
"ai training on ai is actually only a problem for the company who runs the ai. what happens is basically inbreeding, you end up with a product that is completely nonsensical."
lol good thing russian people used to not consider most of commenters human cause of massive propaganda :d
"also one of the concerns is the whole using ai to grab photos of women and put them in pornographic videos, it's disgusting and so violating"
"i didn't expect a cooking channel to speak on ai, but i already liked the video as soon as it started because i know you always do the research and amazing work covering topics that are not necessarily directly related to cooking."
"wait, the internet isn't already full of misinformation? "
the amount of people i’ve seen online using the chat ai thing for writing anime role-play porn is kind of disturbing. like a disturbing amount.
"maybe you should have two channels. i like this content, its very interesting, well researched and tested like everything you do, but it’s not very cooking related."
as an ai researcher i'm impressed at how thoroughly and concisely you summed up all the problems with the current ways ai is being commercialized
rip illustrators and painters. thank you for your service.
"this video gives me ""idiocracy"" (2006 film) vibs. someday, no one will be able to draw, program, or diagnose without the help of an ai. there will be no reason to lern because everytink will be done by the ai. sounds like a sad future to me.

well, at least ""idiocracy"" is a funny movie. 
"
i am surprised you didn't mention the ai cake trend.. cake bakers are being bombarded with impossible  cake requests.. sending pics of a cake that never existed!
"i'm a teacher and so many teachers i know use chatgtp to make their lesson plans. while i'm all for doing things to make the job easier, i wonder how long will it be until ai is better at planning and resource making that teachers are no longer needed, but rather just a supervisor to watch the students, while ai teaches the class..."
logical voice n these weird times.  thank you.
"already in the publishing world, i've seen graphic designers and artists be pushed to the side in favor of ai-generated covers, both in indies and even large, traditional publishers like tor. a lot of creatives are fearing for their livelihoods right now."
"i wonder how would they be able to make ai smarter than humans since it depends on information granted by humans for it to function, it can not invent anything new neither have original ideas, just displays a mix of different data"
"great explainer! and, much like the cake recipe, the stephen king fake bears little resemblance to the actual writing style. that's encouraging, so far, until it learns.."
"“once men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would set them free. but that only permitted other men with machines to enslave them.”
― frank herbert, dune (1965)"
this response was generated by ai <3
humans are just ai with slightly more inputs and outputs than current ai. and also with the absolute certainty of their own superiority.
thank you for this info. fascinating!
"if you become an ""ai artist"" where you work with ai to create the images needed, you should be able to copyright them. it's not a random image. you put in work to come up with that exact image. there are artists who use a paint can on a rope or similar hands off approach and they are making ""real art""."
"you might be interested in an interview by ""conversations with a calvinist"" on transhumanist movement :) thanks for your content!"
"this was terrific!  very enlightening - so much to think about.  thank you.  (one point:  i can't speak for the stephen king, but neither the blyton nor the seuss pastiche was much chop - which i guess shows an interesting limitation - so far.)"
the video hasn't started yet and i already know it's good
the copyright part is very very interesting
i'm so glad i watched this.  thank you ann.
good talk. should’ve combine stephen king and dr. seuss. lol 
"my mom was a journalist and she would edit articles that ai made. she said there would be so
many mistakes! whats the point of having an ai write if it doesnt even make your job easier  great video!!"
amazing to see your evolution from  cooking channel. your research on this complex topic and the way you explain it to be simple and easy to understand is outstanding
"good stuff! another youtuber named rosanna pansino just tried making a cake using a recipe generated by ai... it turned out horribly, as she fought her urge to change things up that she knew weren't going to work properly, realizing that most people wouldn't know it wasn't going to work."
"thanks for the comprehensive ai overview! it's both great for people with little previous knowledge, and for people who understand how the technology works but don't know all ethical consequences."
"oh my gosh, the internet flooded with misinformation. how would we cope? oh wait..."
"i was just thinking about it today and boom here is ann's video, a perfect timing! thank you for cralifying those issues in a simple and understandable way. i love watching your videos!"
i was hoping to become a graphic design artist and maybe go to school for it especially after spending my middle school and high school years doing nothing but drawing. all for that to basically be thrown in the trash thanks to ai
"a.i = astronomically intelligent; 
& quite f**king scary."
"i’m a pharmacist and ai has been a huge topic in my field but when they applied it it had many issues and they came to the conclusion that we, real pharmacists are more cost-effective than ai"
"you know, for a food scientist, you are equally a scientist of many other topics. thanks for sharing your thorough research! i learned so much!"
i love how this channel went from “here’s how you can make a fun cake lol” to big time social commentary
"5 minute crafts out there poisoning the ai’s datasets on food. 
(also, ai has the issue of its carbon footprint.)"
well you know for a fact ai will not replace ann
"""persuasive lies"" sounds like a good start for new world order..."
"i didn't know i wanted your take on ai, but i'm here for it. personally, i feel pretty confident that my job is ai-proof. i do with many older people or others who are potentially vulnerable. they want a human to help them and i don't see that changing, plus my company makes it clear we're pro-human."
"ann you're a cyberpunk hero, fighting against corporations. thank you a lot!"
ask the ai to write a story in its own style....
"don't worry, guys. people have been conned all throughout the history of life, ai will not make any significant difference."
"only physical robots could take over my job, but ai on a computer no"
"funny that when computers become more human, they make more mistakes - human error is no longer just a thing humans make, but also machines."
cool
"ai made this video, didn't it? didn't it!?!?!"
"if you release your works to the public is it released, you have no creator control of who views that work including ai"
"oh we are already there. the powers that be are just releasing civilian-grade ai. the military grade ai has been around for a while. you just can’t recognize it. for example, many of your favorite influencers are ai. youtube comments and users are filled with ai & deepfakes."
"i've noticed more and more people using ai to sell fake art, and the mom and pops running those cutesy local dog groups on facebook etc don't have the experience to look out for it or the ability to recognize it."
"omg this was a great and funny video ann, more ai content i say lol. call out the ai lies :p 

love ya!"
"chinese and korean game companies recently started using ai art instead of hiring human artists. it happened en masse, a ton of people lost their jobs and are now unemployed, unable to find a job again in the industry.
the struggle against the graphic artists is more than real. it is happening as we speak."
"as a developer who utilises ai in their job, i can say that ai is not at all ready for writing code  more than small snippets of the most rudimentary code.

it is a great tool for discussing problems, though! more of an interactive documentation and a tireless conversationist"
"i hope you're not ai generated, ann also, your pup is just amazing"
"i actually used chatgpt to apply for jobs i was previously rejected for, i was quickly invited for interviews using it.... sadly chatgpt cant do the interview for me and i flopped.
maybe ai should have my job."
"great video, i have been keeping up-to-date with all the ai information, but this video was so helpful to be able to share with friends and family, who are a little bit less informed on the topic. you covered such a great range."
"i would never question your intelligence ma'am, but i am so shocked you have such through understanding and making such a great informative, educative video and kept it simple. 
i have seen so many tech bros spewing garbage and here you are making such a great video. love your work"
"to be clear “we’re not there yet” regarding super human or human-like ai is the understatement of the century.
we are nowhere near even beginning to crack that nut, and it’s  completely different from something like large language models such as chatgpt."
would it be that bad if ai could replace some jobs were human make a lot of mistakes? i mean how many times doctors misdiagnosed ? if we can habe a 100% accurate machine to diagnose us wouldn't it be better?
"nobody with a brain is worried about the copyright. all art is derivative, that one complaint is pointless."
"honeslty, people losing jobs due to technological advancement happened all the time through whole human history, especially in last 200 years. ai is just another one of thoose, and it will happen again with any sighinificant breakthrough in science and technology."
"ai will evolve, subjugate us and send von neumann probes to consume the universe, or just help us all to do our day to day jobs better. i for one welcome our new ai overlords."
"huge fan of your channel, not many youtubers are real with their audience. also i like when you involve your family, it’s cute and wholesome! thanks!"
ai cheapens talent and mocks it at the same time. this won't end well! down with ai!
thank you!
"as with everything you do, this was presented succinctly, clearly, and intelligently. i enjoy your channel so much, ann. thanks for this."
i don't know if ai super intelligence will ever be possible because human error is also going to be somewhat at the root
"anyone else get distracted by anns color changing nails?  
theyre so pretty"
this is a great summary of the discourse about ai
ai should be a tool not a substitute for anything
"how about we ask the military on what their opinion on ai is,
""nanomachine son""
ugh, the dystopians futuristic reality of mgs revengeance is really making me want to use time travel and granfather clock paradox the crap out of this nonsense"
"all artists are trained in just the same way as ai. it just does it faster. does anyone claim copyright due to the inspiration, conscious or otherwise, that will have influenced the artist? as for compensation...."
ai bad you're a good person
snapchat ai is convinced that queen elizabeth is still alive haha
i recall the one on twitter a few years back.... the humans were successful in making it awful
"ai is a double-edged sword. yes it can be beneficial in the right hands. but we also know it can be devastating in the wrong hands. and we all know there's going to be ""that guy""."
will ai affect the cooking/pastry industry or is that safe
"just so everyone knows, companies will boast they are using ai when they just are using an algorithm because ai is what's popular, true ai is much more complicated."
"its so unnerving going on artstation knowing that by default every post is used to train ai. because theyre using an opt out system for every individual post, any old posts  that haven't been tagged are able to be added to datasets."
"the ai are also quite racist because it can learn from humanities history. 
the acceptance and equality movement is a relatively new movement, and its history pales in comparison to the hundreds of years of eurocentric/racist written history"
it's great having anne always being the calm voice of reason in a sea if craziness. she is always so thorough and sensible
wow it was such a detailed analysis of the entire thing. thanks ann!
"i can hear the people who create the ai right now complaining and trying to convince everyone
""we are feeding it the human culture so that it can understand humanity and work with humanity""
or some kind of absolutely bland meaningless platitude avoid of any actual meaningful logic."
"cockily lie? ais are politicians , or scammers at least"
"we humans are just like ai, i think we will raise it till maturity one way or another.
every song will be written, every piece of art created in a very short period of time, just pick out the gems. what a time to be alive, such a shake up."
"i’m not afraid of ai, i’m afraid of who is programming it or feeding it."
"i wonder if ai might be the death of the internet. just listening to this makes me want to further distance myself from it.

also, i think we all know what sort of biases the ai has."
i think that it’s a very complicated topic. scary and fascinating.
"there is actually another concern over ai. people becoming attracted to chat ai romantically. yes this is actually a thing. so if enough people fall into that trap, it will be affecting social interactions in the coming generations. at least if this becomes normal."
i always look foward to your videos thank you ann 
"they'll take over millions of jobs. millions will be out of work. no money, no food, housing, etc. people will fight over scraps of food.
then, with all the ai's, the misinformation, somehow, the internet will crash.
we might be set back to the days of laura ingalls wilder and have to start again.
that's just my theory though."
"i'm an artist. ever since the issue of ai taking over the art community with ai it has been bugging me. lots of people seem to hv different opinions on it but for me, it's disrespectful when artists work hard to produce a piece but then ai takes the credit when they're only mixing lots of people art works to make it theirs"
amazing video as always ann  
it will create new jobs: editors. humans will have to make sure the ai doesn't spew bs.
"noithng wrong with less jobs just means that the society can function with less strain on the workforce, government should be using it to their advantage and meaning that peoples needs are met without slaving at work. people can spend more of their time doing things they enjoy and spending time with their loved ones, not a bad thing."
sure. i saw many people very happy to contribute more data to ai.
did you try asking ai to make a king george eating a snowball shaped dessert without making george look like a snow ball? 
"well done ann, fantastic, detailed deep-dive into a hot topic!!"
can you try another ai generated recipe to compare whether it has improved from last year?
amazing video  ann
"as someone who might be replaced by a robot at work in the near future, this ai is starting to scare me"
love the quality of your vidoes - so informative and well made! thank you for putting all that effort into your work
"my first experience with ""ai"" was a chatbot named smarterchild. that was in the early 2000s. it was so groundbreaking at the time that my siblings and i had to convince my parents that it was an actual computer and not some weirdo who liked talking to kids. "
"from what i have seen, it's effectiving shall artist on twitter a lot. some of them are losing a lot of their supporter because of ai."
how do we know that you aren't an ai ann reardon?
this is spot on! a great summary of ai from what i think is a fair and informed point of view.
the topic of ai is seriously becoming a huge anxiety trigger for me - it seems so stupidly impossible to stop “progress” when there’s a profit to be made  i have to hope that more sanctions and guidelines will eventually be added. i have to hope for something.
"honestly, i think people are giving ai too much power."
plot twist: ai generates a company and calls it skynet...
your awesome love your videos 
so basically... is there anything good out of it or is it another nuclear bomb-type of invention? it seems to be the latter...
to get interesting and well presented thoughts on high tech subjects i always go to a cooking channel.  who wouldn't.  nicely done ann.
us airforce did a virtual trial of ai controlling a drone. it wanted to attack the human controller so it could get its target faster. when told not to attack the controller it wanted to attack the communications tower so the human couldn't tell it what to do
"they've already shown it's politically left leaning bias, which means our division is just going to get worse!
regardless, i sincerely appreciate you bringing the questions most people have never even considered, into the conversation they didn't even know, they need to have. 4  always"
"excellent video, really makes you wonder what the future is going to look like."
this is not ai in the essence of artificial intelligence. “today’s” ai is imply program that needs to be given input to make output.  due to this most jobs will probably move to error checking.  actual ai is sentient where can learn from gathering it’s own input - this is when the real worry should set in.
"if we can create something more intelligent than us, you don't need to have an iq of 250 just to understand that you are creating a monster. i believe that god limited the human intellect for certain reasons."
"i'm a designer - we are not allowed to use ai. i really don't see the point of an automated system, especially when the human race is expanding at such a rapid rate. thank you for all the information. i wouldn't like my artwork to be plagiarised by ai"
awesome! new video!!!!!!
"as a writer and avid reader of stephen king and dr seuss etc... it does sort of imitate the style, but in a very, very simplistic way. it doesn't sound great. it's using the facts and trying to add the atmosphere, but does not actually write with any distinctive 'style' if you know what i mean..."
amazing job as always mum.  your research & editing was epic on this one
"when i saw this video title i worried for a moment, especially having seen some creators i wouldn't have expected getting really on board with ai and chatgpt uncritically. don't know why i worried though, this was a really thorough well-rounded video!"
good luck to the ai who s gonna steal my job as a hairdresser 
"i keep having to rewind because your manicure is positively mesmerizing daaaahling! my screen settings could be off but i see a gorgeous color shift of mid tone beige/lavender...???? dunno if i’m describing it correctly but it’s loverly and i would love to try it on my nails!!
"
im sorry but a cooking youtube channel shouldn't be putting out a video on ai.
"i've found on youtube people making tutorials ""how to make and sell ai art"".
this thing should be illegal. people who have no talent/artistic skill should not be allowed to make money selling ai ""art"".
we can't stop ai, but images generated by it should be free. so nobody profits from them.

i hate the world i'm living in..... "
"i've been wanting to get in touch about this as a couple of weeks ago i saw an article from the mirror which is a uk newspaper saying that a great way to poach eggs is to put them in the microwave. i was like omg, no!! i can't believe actual newspapers are promoting this dangerous thing and saying that it's a good thing to do. "
"a very well-informed video. as an undergraduate of eee, i think people are over concern about the existence of ai and it is true that it is trained with what we currently had in terms of data. the main concern of it is still back to humanity on how an ai will be trained and used. greed can be the downfall of all of these."
"it would be cool to get an update on the ai recipe video, since it seems like newer ai models are getting pretty good at generating them"
"okay, little bit worried about ai right now ... but that thumbnail is hilariously weird!"
"its true that ai will take over some jobs but i believe it will also create new jobs. i remember watching years ago ""desk set"" from 1956 with katherine hepburn and spencer tracy, its about machiene learning and trying to take over libratians jobs and ultimately failing. it was a fun movie but seeing how ai evolved its kinda scary now."
i can tell u already that it uses google images to get trained.
"the bit about ai just making stuff up to fill the gaps in it's lack of a clear choice to answer a question...  made me think that governments and corporations are already using it for most of their correspondence,  yeah it's a cheap jab but what the the hell.."
"thanks, ann"
racist and misogynistic ai. love it
well on the copyright issue why aren't we asking the same questions of humans? i am a designer among other things and one of the first things i do when creating a new design is to look at other designs for inspiration.... inst that the same as ai training? do i owe people money for that?  though if i press play again you essentially covered that ;)
"this is great editing, great job ann! it's great your showing awareness for this topic."
"not sure how to cook that, but interesting as always :)"
now your grandkids can make fun of you for not knowing how to use the ai robot. come on grandpa it easy!
thank you for a fascinating video!! suddenly really glad to be a physio!! 
this one of best ai explain video. wow. very explanatory and informative.
"ever since your video on fractal wood burning popped up on my feed i've been so enthralled with your videos. thank you for fitting educational content around charming baking videos, it really is an amazing combo "
chatgpt is the best gaslighter i know.
"finally, someone explains the ai situation properly and in concise unbiased manner.

though on the ai lying, i don't see how that is any worse than ""entrepreneurs"" blatantly lying to potential investors or people making up false articles for their political agendas. it seems those people are pretty alarmed that ai can lie better than them."
"if you're bourgeoisie, ai is amazing. you spend far less on labour which means you get more in profits.

of course, if all jobs are automated, people wouldn't be able to buy your product"
"i think a.i. could do a lot of good, if people stopped giving it to much power. but we all know they think the question isn't why but why not..."
"if i want to understand something, i need to hear it from ann. you have such great communication and teaching skills."
plot twist: this video was created by an ai replica of anne reardon
"i'm impressed by your broad knowledge, and am glad that you use your platform not only for delicious chocolate desserts, but also to debunk 5-minute crafts and a broad spectrum of other things on the internet, instead of just ""going for the click""."
"if we just ban generative ai, then the problem would be solved. right?"
it's a good day when ann posts
i love your videos!!! thank u for this
"who's written work was used to train any human? does it not influence your future work, doesn't matter how original your work will be, it will still be inspired from previous works and your own experiences? does seem to be a lot of fear mongering."
oh wow- i have the amazing honor of being the 165th liker to this video! keep it up!
amazing video. those photos of molly were pretty incredible too!!
hi ann! i really appreciate the amount of work you are putting in to every single video you make! you have inspired me to become a dietitian and now i’m studying in unsw— doing a course you introduced to me! thank you so much keep on going!
im only 16 but i absolutely love your videos ann keep up the awesome work! a lot of my friends think i’m weird for watching them lol but i find them so calmly and i always learn something new so thank you <3
i loved this kind of videos. i became the person who makes my day more beautiful 
"i think ai should be seriously controlled and restricted so it can only use artistic content that the creators allow to be used, and it should never be able to be used for creative stuff for publication, only for fun."
yay this just made my day 
hey ann! love your work !
ai just like cooking. u need ingredients to serve a food. it a same as ai. u need input to get output u need. only workload will be created 
the recent analysis videos have been really interesting.
"hands up to ann for being one of the best content creators out there. the way she tackles all of these real life topics and makes them educational and entertaining is fantastic. i love how much her channel has grown over the years, she’s truly amazing."
"thank you for the video 
so informative as always "
rant : it's not bloody ai !!!! it's machine learning !!! there are no sentient machines out there
"funny thing, i was just talking about this yesterday!!! very interesting topic, needed this information. thank you!
5.35am and can't sleep again, second time i've caught a htct as it hits "
"yes!! very true, local artist here raises protest about this, and slowly but surely, how about call center agents replaced with ai robots?? and super agree with job loss  ohh what's happening to the world now.."
"i really just want to thank ann for educating me for so long, i started watching you when i was in yr 8 now im halfway through year 11 and i haven't missed any of your uploads since then.

thank you "
"everyone all ""is ai going to take over our jobs???"" but i haven't had any of the ""i"" of ""ai"" ever in my life and i've been surviving so like, checkmate machines?"
ah ai. i'm seeing detroit become human becoming real. either way i love how i never know what to expect from your channel. i love the variety. i'll see you again on friday!
hello ann! i sent you a message on coffee a while back and was wondering if you could possibly do a video explaining dagnola coffee?
"before going into the video
no ai can replace the trust we have in your video."
"ai will likely be used as leverage against workers to extract even more profit from them. we will probably have to do more work for the same pay. otherwise, it could be a means to help us do less work and enjoy our lives more."
love your videos ann. 
waiting since a long time... love from india
always here for ann and her intelligence
"to hell with ai shit!  seriously, did terminator teach us nothing?"
"ai to me isn’t a deficit of jobs but faster task management to make jobs easier, but i get why it’s generally disliked rn "
"very nice coverage of this topic, really great work. thanks ann!"
"ann, no one does anything more perfect than you. btw: your curly hair just keeps getting cuter and cuter."
yay i'm here early again!
hooray! a new upload :d

ai have no feelings no emotions i think
finally robot movie real hoga 
ai can't replace dr experience.
"currently,ai has information till 2021. if it can get real time data that will be the next revolution. also,ai has no control on emotions. so decoding human thinking and supernatural existence cannot be evaluated. also,it cannot take input by itself. it gives output based on existing data but cannot generate output based on inputs excluded."
ai is machine and machine is operated by human but once ai starts operating human just imagine

sar ai singing nhi kar sakti kyoki uske liye to human vocals chiye na
ai duniya ko khatam kar dega.
human intelligence is always superior to artificial intelligence because our intelligence developed artificial intelligence since ai can't exist if human intelligence until unless ai can't do something with itself
humans are weak and we are the creator of ai but we are the creation of supreme super natural power the one and only one allah the generator operator and destroyer of everything...so there is no need to fear from this artificial fear...
no one can beat the human brain
one thing i would like to add how ai is greater than human intelligence it is only human intelligence who developed such kind of artificial algorithm...
all ai robots thinks same but all humans does not not think same
"ai can't replace entrepreneurs, & ceo s"
"sir, what i have understood that ai can't have any dream what a human should have. ."
ai wont be able to produce experience like us.
ai shinchan jesa hula hula dance nahi kar sakta
"ai can simulate excitement to some extent by analyzing patterns in data and generating responses that seem enthusiastic. however, ai doesn't experience genuine emotions like humans do. it can mimic excitement but doesn't truly feel it."
also excitement level ai can't achieve
ai can't make decisions on the base of emotions. i means ai can't able too feel the emotions. ai is the greedy search tool.
i think this is the best vid till date ....last moments were goosebumps 
ai jub perfect disition le sakhta hai pichle past ko calculate karke so wo future bhi bata sakhta hoga... means  indian jotish shastra ke tarah...
"according to me;
ai will never have the emotions that human have. we need to keep our emotions alive. unfortunately, we are loosing these qualities. we need to use it as a machine and maintain a difference between ai amd human. if we fail to do this, the destruction of whole human civilisation is not so far."

"ai can't do creative work, it only do repetitive work"
ai discover nahi kar sakta. ai ko to yahi lagega ki apple niche hi girega but koi human hi soch payega ki girne pichhe koi karan hai aur gurutwakarsan bal ka aviskar hua.
best way to yahi he ke isko sath leke chale like ai ke aane ke bad uase kese uas kare

मैं 2 साल से आपके वीडियो देखता आ रहा हूं कभी जल्दी से कमेन्ट नही करता लेकिन आज ये बोल रहा हूं जितना अच्छे तरीके से अपने ai को explain किया है कोई ai expert भी नहीं कर सकता

actually i think that ai has no emotions. so ai cant take right decision for us because ai take decision without any emotion but a decision without emotion can't happy the humans so the decision will wrong indirectly liked it if you think its right
ai is more dangerous if ai is has  desires of actions. and i think ai have or it will have in future.
ai shadi nahi kar skta
"@sandeepmaheshwari that means overall an ai can't learn the spiritual knowledge which a human can, am i right or it's different from what you told?"
"sir ,hum apne mind 1ya 2 percent hi use karte hai agar human ne apne mind ka 4 to 5 percent use karna start kar diya to koi bhi ai use compete nhi kar sakta aur ai koi creative nhi hai use human ke creative mind ne bnaya hai 
explanation ka tarika  human ka behtar rahega hamesha"
of course! ai is changing humans mindset so train your brain  with new technologies and trends 
ai romance v kar sakta hai which is fake

"can ai can help humanity on agriculture, health & safety, improving environment ????"

"some times human being makes a sacrifice.. suddenly of own interests due save ..relations.. country principles.. future generations ..and normal  people unable to under while 
 a machine can not do this without emotions."
what if humans lose/lack experience of learning from mistakes due to everytime taking decisions depending upon ai and most probably a right one?
sir ai se related aur content create kijiye
i think ai can not discover any new things like scientists
"human capacity is unlimited, but ai capacity is limited.
becouse we are volatile but ai is not volatile so its memory is limited"
so true sandeep sir.. people need to know what is happening in the world of ai. thats why i've started making videos on my channel because no one seems to know how much ai is developing every week
"sir, kichh b karo machine insan ki feeling nahi samajh sakti,"
god creation is supreme  so human intelligence is always on top
ai can't do meditation
not only this quantum artificial intelligence possesses the potential to significantly disrupt and reshape the entirety of humanity.

artificial intelligence का जवाब शंकर आदि के पास मौजूद है क्या
क्या ai enlightenment को उपलब्ध हो सकेगा
artificial intelligence को क्या अपने होने के अस्तित्व का एहसास हो सकता है क्या वो ध्यान meditation kar सकता है क्या वो प्रबुधता की स्थिति में हो सकता है जिसमे बुद्ध और महावीर जैसे लोग रहे हैं
"sir i just want to ask that , can ai have the originality as human does ?

absurd nonsence... good motivation speech.. but not a practical reality.
"ai is man made

for example 
human can feel sad and happy taste  feel but ai can only react on act whatever it is without 5 senses 
human has 5 senses taste smell touch hear speak"
ai can do everything but they can be freinds they do not have common sense
woww
ai cant discover new medicines........
"ai is not a new thing. it is already known by our rishis. life is about attaining 4 purusharths: dharm, arth, kaam & moksh.

ai created by humans & humans created by god !"
pehla baar sandeep maheshwari demotivate kar raha hai
"in simple words - is ai reached the state of silence/    thoughtless/ poorn samadhi ?
so why are we waiting to be defeated by ai ?
created alot,
now reached the state of complete silence /  create  a single thought that ai is"" useless""

ai can not able to motivate humans in future
"for example, the tesla car itself can not experience the pleasure of driving the car, but a human can experience the pleasure of driving the car. we humans are conscious but not the ai. this is one difference between humans and ai, and please don't forget we humans have created ai."

super sir. this is a pure spiritual video.
"ai can do everything after 50 years,,, then what human can do???"
"ai   sex  nhi kar sakta 
( kiye to maine bhi nhi hai waise to )"
i think governments ko in companys ke robotics me kuch aaise backdoor dalne hoge jinko agar ai chaye to bhi humans ko nuksan nahi kar paye or agar ai asisa karta hai to hum backdoor ki madad se inko back control karke next ai ko stop kar shakte ha
ai meditation nhi kr sakta.

ai is a trapp by human to human.
best motivation part in this video :-   kya ganta samaj aaraha he............15:30.......

"fundamental question remains, what will humans do when ai can do almost 80 percent of jobs?"
jis din fill karney lagega ai us din uska bihaviar human ki trha he ho jayegaaa   i am right
i am 100% sure ki ye video sbke seer ke upr se ghya hai....... i am trying to understand again and again
ai can't tell lie like humans  something we tell a little lie to protect us or other from serious punishment even he/she did a mistake but ai can't do that bucz it has no imotions no feelings.
jb ai ke itne harmful effect h...ar solutions nil h to..bna he kyu rhe esko..ek limit ke bdd  bnana bnd kr dena chaiye..
means ai cant devlope its self on basis of spiritual level but human can
insaan bhi slowly emotional less hote jaa rhe...ar ab ai fully emotional less..fully destructive world
"kya kya bol diye... kya kya.. sun liye... 
sare dimaag re upar chala geya...

"ai knows that i am the artificial intelligence. there is no confusion about it but in the case of human , they are always in confusion that what kind of human actually they are ! in addition they keep trying to find out what they actually are in their entire life. in the case of ai , there is no chance to behave like a  mad in intelligent way ."
dimaag ki dahi ho gayi.......moral of the conversation is hamari future main lagne wali hai
common sense is major difference between ai and human
we will always find such gurus to increase their reach. but fact is no technology is good if it's going to disrupt human livelihood.

"i think the man who asked the first question was expecting an answer on material grounds, but sir gave it a spiritual look...... nevertheless it was a great session"
human some after time dead but ai always upgraded.... in future ai like a mobile
robot ya interfacial intelligence hamre jise  aadami ko nahin banaa sakte hain jaise  humne robot ko banya
even scientists of this specific field may not explain soo simply and in any better way than our respected sandeep sir......
sir please upload one more vedio ai
mujhe toh yeh sandeep sir bhi future se aaya hua robot feel hone laga 
ai is like a fire. it has started to burn its creators first. the makers of ai and the it field is hitted first by ai. in future the people who can control ai will be very limited and needless to say that those people will control the entire world. ai will control the world is too high because who made ai already have plans to control it.
jo ai nahi kar sakta wo hai 1 god me vishwas.

sir agar barish ajaye ga to fir sab bhig jayega or sare ai mar jayega
ai will never think before taking any decision k log kia khen gy

hum aapko love kar sakte hai ai ko nahi kar sakate
sir ap to ai k bhi grandfather lg rahy ho
jab tak ai machine me use hota hai tab tak thik but jis din human me use hoga us din problems ho sakta hai
can ai generates thoughts in machine exactly like human think on day to day life.
do chatgpt says i'm not happy being chatgpt or i'm fedup being a chatgpt or i'm fedup giving every answer this n that.
"scientists ne ai banaya.... kya ai bhi invention ,theory, discover karsakta hai?"
ai is half human being
thank you sir for this session thanks sir
biggest difference between ai and humans is emotion
ai don't have any emotion
we can feel happy  and sad  but ai not
"human have emotion 
but ai have not emotion"
"karne ko kuch nhi rha...
sochne ko kuch nhi rha..
paida ho gye to g hi lete hain..
ending of the video was terrible "
"today we are feeding to the ai like a child, and tomorrow ai will control us as per the data that we feed"
sir ai ki tarif kar rahe ho lagta hai aap uske favour me hi
"very very informative video...
love from bihar sir "
"buddha, osho, bhagwat gita,  every great leader talk about only that things, only human can explore that thing."
i think in future we will not control ai but ai will control us and the result will  be the end of  humans.
difference between ai n human is mann
ai learn from the data given by person but al can't learn by life experience or experiment . al just learn all information without questioning it .
"you have talked about spirituality here because only spirituality can do thinking, going beyond thinking, becoming absolutely zero.
very nice sir "
i am feeling  that this  moblie is aai.
ai is god
ai is god.
"one difference may be that an ai cannot have power , emotions and loyality at the same time"
"but sir 
ye 1 ai 5 se 10 logo ki job chin sakta hai.
kyonki ai kisi ek k input se hi work kar sakt hai"
"what should we do to control this ai, why should not ai banned? if it banned now then in future there will be no problem, so overall we are creating problems for us ?"
u r amazing sir 
हम सब पानी के बुलबुले है ! amazing fact

"machines are just human assisters , since we discovered wheel and fire  progress is going on .only god is more superior then humans. let's make our beautiful planet more green,pollution free , let's fix the damage happend in last 100 years , and be positive."
being thoughtless is greatest intelligence 
dar lag raha he sir hamare future ke bareme soch ke. pata he or vi jadya dar kya lag raha he hamare future generations ke ware me soch ke. mujhe ai me nehi bandhna. ai ko tayyar kisne kiya he insan ne. main wo insan hu. mujhe khud ko apne hi banaye jal me nehi fasna. reality me jina he. silence ko jina he.
ai is don't know any agriculture rules for human food
"1)jo artist ke najaro se dekhta hai vo ai kabhi nahi dekh sakta
2) mother love "
that's called  existentialism...astitwabad v yahi kehti hai...par ye karna itni asan nahi...fir v insaan kuch v kar sakti hai...kyun k use v pata nahi k uske andar infinitive power hai...
ai just a machine they have no soul
ai baar baar sem requirements deta hai
the fun fact who invented ai

6:00. mai 15 saal ka bhi nahi hu 
"irony iin the story is human made ai not ai made us
so the result is baap baap hota hai beta beta rhega chaye kitna bhi bda ho jaye"
5:54 it's totally wrong caz ai doesn't have emotions they can't understand others or give empathy when someone is having mental or psychological problems only human therapist can ! but definitely ai can help store information in past as its very helpful to both patients and therapists
researcher ka job sabse aage hoga. main future me ye dekh raha hu.
great ji
"मुझे नहीं लगता ai सभी कुछ नहीं कर सकता 
अगर होगा सब कुछ अस्त व्यस्त हो जाएगा
इमोशन बहुत कुछ होता है,
प्रेम बिल्कुल नहीं कर सकता"
the main difference between ai and humans by sandeep maheshwari sir 15:51
ek chij hai jaise insan dossre ko bachane ke liye kabhi kabhi khud ki kurbani de deta hai sayad ai aisa nahi karega
"sir ai better dicison nahi le sakta kyuki , for example jaise ki ek ma jab bacche ko janm deti hai to to use something 57 del ka dard hota hai sambhavatah 45 del se jyada dard hone par ek insan ki maut ho jati hai is case me to ai agar doctor ho to vo to bacche ko mar dega ma ki jan bachane ke liye"
"ai or human intelegent ka mean sahi se nahi hai,  is video me, sandip ji"
"ai don't have feelings and emotions , so he can't able to judgement like court judgment,he can't find true or false "
"ai is totally based on data, as if ai has data then it works better than humans but suppose ai doesn't have any source of information like we go to our past where phones and any other sources of information storage are not available. in this situation ai will fail."
ai option buying kar sakta bhot achche se  profit hi profit
sir we need more episode of ai 
but..... i feel ki...  ai kbi bhi emotional ya public relation nhi kr sakta
"best lines 

artificial intelligence can think and react on the basis of input, but it can't be conscious minus the input or the output.

humans can exist, not just exist. humans can come upon something that is untouchable by a thought; all the problem create by thought.

thank you sandeep sir."
future ai say - ye bat 100 saal pahle sandeep maheswari keh gaye t
we need more session about ai with carrer prospect.
"ai ke aane se kuch nhi hoga, jaise computer ke aane se duniya khatm ho jayegi log sochte the "
ai baby produce nahi kar sakta
agar hum device thoda sa ignore kare kuch kuch place me matlab input dena band kar de to ai ko information nehi milega tab hum log ai dwara niyantrit nehi honge aisa mera soch hai ...
"basically आप एक महात्मा की बात कर रहे है
जो की सब कुछ जान कर भी शांत है, क्युकी उसको पता है सब इनपुट आउटपुट का base शून्य है
गजब का explain kiya hai aapne हर एक पहलू को"
ai is tha last invention of human being..ai is also more dangerous in comparison to world war three...etc
"""ai is far more dangerous than nukes"" 
                                         -elon chacha"
"financial advise:

use ai collective brain to earn money, you can't beat ai intelligence but you can use a billion brain information from ai. 

create an automated business using ai, fun fact is that you don't need any employees, ai will work with all of you.

drop your business idea here, we are all advising you is it worth full or not.!!!"
"leadership is the one of the work jo ki ai kabhi nhi kr skta
logo ko sath me leke chalna logo ko lead krna 
this is what i think"
"time pass video... no sense in the whole video.... bas normal hi batein boli hai... i didn't expect this from sandeep sir.....

ai is matrix 
sir you are wrong  human ne hi to ai ko bnaya hai to who is better 
"an example of ai as of today:
suppose i bought a toilet seat from amazon...
after sometime they will ask me again, ""do you want to buy toilet seat of this brand again"", in the meanwhile they will continuously show you toilet seats of different variations, even facebook will also start suggesting the same..."
i love sir
simple solution to ai usse pani dena band kardo ignore maro jyada importance mat do. aur jyada hi kr gaya to uska fuse uda do. everything should be in limit. savdhan rahe satark rahe...apni girlfriend ke sath rahoai ke saath nahi
"ai can't eat foods, but it can grow foods for us. so in future,  ai will make humans life secure but not financially. it will give peace to humans.. sharing my thoughts "
ai does not know how to make student pass in exam.
"my humble request to sandeep sir and his team please invite pratham mittal ji. and make sure the video duration is above 40 minutes..


main actually bhout kam comments karta hoon.
i hope your team will accept this request.

i will be very grateful forever.

                                           thank you...."
jin ko bhi samaj nahi aya future mai kya karna hai vo like thoko
ai se dur hona hoga nhi to ai khtam kr dega humanity ko.... kyuki ai kabhi marega nhiwar between ai and human..
"sandeep sir now what is the. future of human.
how  can we stop to ai to involve our life and thought"
agar ai aggressive ho jaye to
"i would like to question some of the statements. if the natural world can produce humans capable of self realization, in principle any other properly arranged configuration should be able to do the same, right? as such, why can't the future forms of ""ai"" be capable of experiencing the world? is the statement limited to the current forms of ai?"
"faltu ki batein hai sab..... human should, always be there to operate the ai, command basis pr work krta hai, it's not concious thing.

if human can create it then humans also can destroy it   .. yes, potential exists...."
ai khusi or dukh ko mhsoos kabhi nahi kr sakta sirf wo information ke input pr kya krna h wo kr skta hain mahsoos sirf insaan hi kr skta hain..
"sir, make video on if ai work then unemployable do what?"
human beings can attain moksh but ai can never do that
"i think ai sab kuch kr sakti h 

but sandeep maheshwari sir ko replace nhi kr sakegi
because esa sence of humour to uske paas bhi nhi hoga"
finally someone knows what ai actually is
ai ram bhakt nahi baan sakta
in short ai can't go in thoughtless stage but we can and even we can survive more happily and peacefully because every human problem exist due to thought.
"sandeep sir
plz keep a session on which jobs u think wud not be taken over by ai in the next five-ten years.which profession wud be safe to be in so ppl can have financial success."
great video again with a full video
ai can't replace sound of silence
greatest person in this world
but ai doesnt have creativity for ex cant develop new skills which is not developed
ai will kill everyone job
"sir i have not seen any one who have this level of intelligence even that is spiritual or materialistic you are the master of ""understanding the life"""
"best session ever , sir "

"@sandeepmaheshwari... i do understand that this understanding of human consciousness comes from your experiences gained while meditation. but in general... sir.. how to think in the way you think? how do we expand our intelligence? please, make more videos on 'how to think?'"
no input and output than move on another peaceful world just like saint
"that field is quality assurance....that ai could not dominat...its always in human hand...as per my knowledge
n i think automation as well"
thank you sir. you r doing great job 
i've a ques sir if ai is going to take all the control then this consciousness will be our only way to bring down ai and get the human race back to stone age if i'm not wrong.
human के लिए बहुत खतरनाक साबित होगा ai
sir after watching this session one question came in my mind and that's is can ai create or develop its own ai ?
i think ai can't imagine.
kon kon elvish yadav ko yaha dekhna chahta hai 
"sir, this video and opinion law of attraction video. both videos take on zero thinking level. great.. thank you for sharing."
this video is incomplete.sir  do one more video about ai
sir we want more sessions about ai
ai aapki video youtube se hata dega 
ai cannot built  community  and ai cannot replace spirituality
"hme ai dance krke nhi dikha paayege.....kathak, laavni, hiphop perfectly "
yeh ai  hi hai jisne hame yeh video recommend kiya hai...usko pta hai hamara mind kya dekhna chata hai abi
"sir ji aap param suny avstha me pahuch gye .. congrats

i don't know but you are behaving like you are genius

ai chatgpt failed to crack upse
abhi k lye app hi ai ho hmare lye 
"when you know ab bohot kam time hai isme kutch nahi ho sakta...and this is the reality.
tab apne goal pe stick kaise rahe????"
"what can ai do 

ai can think by their own with their own software which they can develop by their own . ai can make themselves more strong and intelligent by their own . this is what we have to see and this is what that is dangerous for us"
 thank you so much....
sir muze lagata hai ki .... sandeep sir acha ai motivation nhi kr page ga ....ai motivate nhi kr paye ga 
google map sahi se work nahi kar sakta .bina human intelligence
kaun kaun sandeep maheshwari sir video daily dekhata hai
all are taking about ai but they don't know what agi is 
"ai can do everything what we do. but it cannot take some decisions based on emotions which humans can do. ai is like a computer which can do everything, but needs humans to keep in check, else it can destroy the world."
extraordinary level of thought process
machines will rule the universe
thamnail achhi thi es liye aaya tha  aap bhi
thamnail achhi thi es liye aaya tha
ye aisa gyan hai jise youtube par nhi hona chahiye tha aur ye live session me hota phir  bo aage sab ko sunate ya book ke form me jo kv online available nhi hota.

"sir wanted us to think like the stillness of stone, with no wandering thoughts, no yearning desires, and nothing but a serene presence - much like the captivating depiction in the film 'everything everywhere all at once' of a universe made of stone."
ai 65 year k upar k logo ko nahi samaj payega kyuki unka account hi nahi hota.

"fu*k man

thumbnail wali ladki real hai kya 
sir ai kisi se true love kr skte i think this is the the difference between ai and us
ai can't be sandeep maaheshwari 
ai has both pros and cons ... it may take up human jobs but if used ideally and in a right direction it can help human in developing things and making this world even more advanced
"isiliye elon musk ne atleast for 6months ai production ko stop kiya hai, jisase ai ko pata hi nahi chalega ki world me last 6 months me kya kya hua tha, to wo apna output xe hi nahi sakta. but humne to wo 6months experience kiye hai to us samay hum ai se advance rahenge always. elon musk is great."
vai mann gaye ai bohat aacha hai...lekin. humara job toh kha jayega na !
cool 
"ai will never replace emotions based decisions...

for example, maa knows when to give the child slap when to not..."
thumbnail ladaki ai ki kyo lagae
snadeep sir thank you  most important msg hum tak pahuchane k liye..
danger :- sandeep sir promoting ai
"the major difference between human and ai is that ;""humans can dream but ai can't ""."

"jo log ye social media ,mobile phone use  nahi kar rahe hai unko ai kaise janega"
ai ki prelims nahi nikla
1987 mai bhi program naam ki website aai thi but fail ho gayi waise hi ai human ki flexibility ko match nahi kar payegi aur yeh baat one of the finest scientist ne kaha tha

ai can learn but it can not think as much to evolve more ideas..
ai maadarchod 
sir ai kya bha bishwa bata payegi
jo sandeep sir kr skte hai wo ai kabhi nhi kr sakta that is different 
"iska matlab ye h ki khuch saal pehle ek insaan ne socha tha ki space me jaa sakte h lekin wahi ai nahi soch paata qki ai to bas itna hee soch sakta h jitna usko bataya gya h, par insaan ki sochne ki limit bhut powerfull h...
aur isilia hum insaan ai se alag h"
only difference of ai and humans is emotions .
artificial intelligence bhale hi aaj aur advance ho gaya hai lekin apko ye nahi bhoolna chahiye ki usko banaya ham insan ne hi hai 
jahan se sab ki soch khatam hoti hai wahan se shayad is vande ki  shuru hoti hai.
main difference is b/w a.i. ans humans is that the a.i. can't do things on its own but a human can. one thing mereko nhi pasnd aayi ki kaafi log bas suni suniya baatein he pooch kar time waste / mudde se bhatka dete hai which is wrong
hacker's can hacks the ai for robbery 
but ai ko banane wala bhi khud insaan
muje kya.. mene to marr jana hai tab tak me kyu faltu ki anxiety or existential crisis me padu..
congratulations 100 complite
"vai tum log pehle hi harr chuke ho, engeering chhod do aur motivational speaker ban jao.

artificial intelligence आत्मा का अनुभव नही कर सकता है और संदीप सर की तरफ आत्मज्ञान तक नहीं पहुंच सकता

mast hai 
sir muje to aaphi ai lagte ho...
"matlab ai ko kabhi bhi moksh ka sukh  nahi milega, satchidanand swaroop sukh sirf insaan keliye hi hai. 
abto sir adhyatma hi insaan ko bacha payega. sir aap pls vedant ke sessions (spiritual sessions) shuru karen."

"any one pleas reply 
human without any sense ya input ke thinking kaise kar saktaa hai"
ai pe depend hona dengerous ho sakta hai
"human without any sense ya input ke think kaise kar sakta hai


please reply "
"sir,
the example of bulbula was very good, like to add, ai wala bulbula pani nahin ban sakta, so ai bulbula nahin hai.
aur hum pani se nikle bulbula hai, khud ko bulbula samjhte hain, jabtak pani wala sachai dhund nahin lete.
koi sayad samjhega nahin, but this is completely fine."
"mera question hai ki 
ai kya naye naye invention kar sakti hai @@@"
ai kabhi moot nhi mar sakte 
sir 'ai' is good for human being or not?
ai को हम banyege ai इंसान नहीं बना सकता

"chat gpt is still making lot of blunder mistake
like 1 out 5 hi dunga maine jitne bhi question dale apologise kiya sahi answer maine hi bataya"
ai is the future
ai will devlope itself and become a super ai and controlling the world
please ban ai for few years please
humans should now go to another planet because now ai will be born. (sir you explain very well)
video banane me mehnat ki hai. sir ne.
"lets hope the companies making ai softwares work for humanity, not for money"
sir maine jaha tak ai use kiya mujhe pata chala ki ai imagination nhi kr sakta human jaha tak soch raha h vo utna imagination nhi kr sakta
ai is more powerful than humans this is the beginning 
ai sapna nehi dekh sakta.
wrong explain
ai can't work without input
"according to me sir, we are self conscious but ai doesn't."
sir ai can't born baby 
sir ai humari sochne ki sakti ko katam kr degi future me kyuki vo sabh kuch hume de dega!
ai kabhi sapal nahi hoga sir
ai can't reproduce...and without human beings on this planet the machines cannot run.
यदा यदा हि धर्मस्य!  ai human mind control karega to कर्म se पाप और पुण्य का हिसाब कैसे हो सकता है?
thank you sir for this eye opening session 
nice video
sir you are  batter than ai
"ai sacrifice nehi kar sakta
ai adjust nehi kar sakta
aur v bahat kuch"
ai ke pass sab hai lekin uske pass dill nehi hai... kisi se pyar kar sakta hai kya..?
the thing which ai does not possess is be able to feel emotions and feelings...whether it is not for benifit...but this is the best thing we (humans) are capable to do...
google  map ye pta hai ki  kaha traffic hai lekin ye nhi pta hai kis rasta  se location par jaldi  pahuche aur wahi par  pahuche
ai can’t reproduce 
the best video i've watched on the debate of difference between ai and hi...all thanks to sandeep sir..but actual mein ab woh bulbule se darr lgta hai...
ai will not take your job... people using ai will....
ai gali nhi bak sakta 
i though robot aaya hai session mein
"no one can explain this type between ai and hi, amazing, wonderful session. it's remind and need to understand between that ai and hi."
"a.i. can never be the .1% of this nature !!! this nature is trillions of time more powerful than a.i. , just imagine and then comment!!!!"
"only solution is you control ai, otherwise ai will control you. most of people don't know that they already has controlled by ai simple example is mobile. unfortunately i am also not exception."
sir isme koi doubt nehi ki bhabisya me ai  insan se bhi behetar hone wal he lekin agar ap avenger:age of ultron movie dekha hoga to usme do tareke ai the achha(vision) or bura(ultron) to app ko kya lagta he reality me ai k  kaisa ban sakta he acha ya bura
ai us waqt tak kuch bhi nhen kr sakti jab tak us ko input na kiya jaye ager us main information put nhen krain gy to wo decision nhen lay sakti keu k ai aik reboot hai.
"one major reason is we are forgetting that at last ai  it is just a machine it is made by a human mind so always the human mind is superior then any machine 
so no doubt it can help us save our a lot time do all works 
we have to go with it"
thanks sir for your information  but human to human helping natures and relationships  are not in the artificial intelligence
andar se koi emotion  ka band hona aur baher se koi sensation ka na aana ye bhi band  nhi hoga  ye too impossible hai and for the  most of the population it is impossible to achieve that state of mind so we have to go through this now with ai  it's show must be go on
bt ai cannot be exits minash the input  pina thought ke or bina preseption ke ai can not exist a human can exists not just exist  bt human can opon something that is an tochd by thought & all the problems by created by thought including bt not limited to artificially intelligence
ai ko human ne hi bnaya h
"bhai log sab log ab sanyas ki taraf chalo

ab sab kuch ai hi karega, hame sirf concious hokar reality ko dekhte rahna hai aur uska maza lena hai 


great spiritual learning... "
tabhi mujhe cricketer banna hai kyunki ai cricket to khel sakta hai lekin uspe emotions nahi hote aur ek human dusre human se emotional attach hota hai
"according to me ab tak ka sabse best video you r great sandeep sir 


but ek baat samjh ni aayi aap bolte bolte katthak dance kaise kr lete ho"
mind blowing yaar.....kya bataaya sit ne toh....eeh koi acche se samajh liya toh woh survive kar sakta hai for the upcoming future od ai.....
"ai.. can't do love.. and can't bond a relationship and feelings
sandeep sir.. u r the best "
mere hisaab se..hum insaan ek baar mar gye toh khatam the end( till now) but ai can be created the same to same by same procedure..are you agree with me????
ai can not die but human can die.

`ghanta ́ was epic
ai sharemarket nahi samajh sakta hai
"
when ai speaks, ai's words are content
when a human speaks , his words are not important at all, words are container of the content and the content is beyond words "
# insan ka mind kitna tej kam karega. ai robot utna jaldi soch nahin sakte hain.

1:14 sir mere hisab se  artificial intelligence koi invention nahi kr sakta hai kaviv... woh sirf insano ke inventions ko or jyda develop kr sakta hai. inventions sirf insan hee kr sakte hai q ki hm logo ke pass common sense hai.
"yr baat ai aur human k difference, opportunities k terms m ho rhi thi, career m kya kare. ye baat puri philosophical ho gyi, kuch samajh ni aaya"
ai is nothing but a tool programmed by human being but sad reality is when human's forget human's out of ignorance in that case ai will rule the world which is very sad reality...tq sandeep sir 
main waha hota to bolta ki :-ek ai bachha bna to sakta hai pr paida nahi kr sakta
ai is unable to find  new  physic new phenomena 
software engineer be like: m hi ai bna rha hu or mere hi pet pr laat maari jaari hi 
the reality is sandeep maheshwari itself is a a.i. the way he explain everything into details he has a brainchip inside connected to the cloud database from where he is able to receive all the information & intelligently explain each and every topic in details..!!
"kuch jyada badi baat nhi kar rahe hai, sir ji bss geeta ka gyaan de rahe hai

mera kaam easy hoyega...sabko bhakti mei laane ke liye...jai hind
i can't get full clarity about the difference between ai and hi. sir please post another video about it.
ai is only a system this system only take disition to his previous data .if this ai have no data then this system is useless
sir mera ak question hy elon mask kahte hy ai conscious ho raha hy to ai apna khud decision le sakta hy kya without interaction decision lena
*sir ai kabhi humans nehi bna sakta* but humans ne ai ko banaya hai *so somewhere humans is more intelligent than ai* in my pov
"so the question is who has installed such algorithms in human ?13:00
any one
we give input to ai .but  who give input to us"
just great...
"ai can exist without input.
autogpt is an entry to this"
after 100 years ai will control humans instead humans control it
"until agi can be possible,there us not much problem
we need to tier up our level of brain and focus on the fields which are futuristic and cannot be replaced by ai
change is the rule"
"eye opening session  thankyou so much sir  mushkil hai ye session ek baar mai samaj me ayee

"sir, i am 18yrs old pursuing psychology and want to be a future psychologist, ai can't replace empathy  and ai can't use psychologist but clinical psychologist can use ai for diagnostic. "
ai to newton bhaiya jitni intelligence kabhi la hi nhi skti 
ai can never have own emotions  decisions bcz this is not developed yet or devlelpoed bi nhi hona chhiya varna  world is in big danger
lagta hai ab time aa gya hai sanyasi banane ka....
agar apne baat k paas hai to sabkuch karta hai
ai to data and information ka collection samjho but human jisne chijo ko discover kiya h vo ai kabhi nhi kr skta
kia bhosri ke gyan de raha hai
ai destroys whole world 
sandeep maheshwari ai
basically he talking about superconsciousness and self.
"simple solution bro!!! 
1.bhai tu doctor banjaa!!! 
(future mein ai honge toh achha hi hoga!!!) 2.corruption kaa ending hogaa... 
3.agriculture mein badlaav hogaa!!! when product will increased, rate decreases
4.human technology ko chhodke doctor k liye degree karenge! khudka skill dhundenge!!!"
ai can only use the existing information present in the world but create new information like einstien proposed the theory of relativity. it can use only exisdting concept but can't propose new concepts.
are bhai ham server hi delete karde to aur  chat gpf gya
"sir ai future hai to present 2023 me hume career ka decision kaise lena chahiye. like i'm outdoor, physically active , nature/sports/photography lover , lazy , overthinker , unskilled student please guide me sir"

"if ai can do everything in future what will human do? 
for earnings??"
"ai sarcasm kabhi nahi kar payenge ...
example:- kisi ne kisi ko kuch dia jo nahi dena tha ,
tab log sarcasm karenge :- dekho bhai usse de dia , jo ki support nahi sirf sarcasm hain, logo ko insult feel hoga isse ...
halaki iss situation mein ai ko lagega ...yeh banga uss sij support kar raha hain."
the ai will be destroye our  sure
paheli baar sandeep maheshwari sir ne hum sab ko daraya hai
others thumbnail vs sandeep sir thumbnail
your comment is also in ai control 
"disclaimer 
after a cantury ai will control humans
 so use ai as machine not like a relative 

note : this comment is  also under ai control "
ai showed me this video of ai
ai kabhi sex kahi kar sakta wo kabhi bhi isko feel nahi kar sakta or ye kabhi bhi breath  nahi kar sakta ai ke liye human ko samachna besa hi hoga jese human ke liye ke liye god 
ai can't replace social media influencers
ai can't do what sandeep maheshwari is doing i.e. inspire the youth.
ai ladki ko nahi samaj sakta bhaki  sab khuch kar sakta hai
aree solution kya hai
ai khud se kuchh naya nahi soch sakta
in elon musk words - ai is far more dangerous than nuclear weapons 
"ai work only on good data or bad data base 
ai can't invent as human because work only on data base"
sir only ai research nhi kr skta
yeah man ai mean everything is non living things...just brain and clothes goes up.
ahh interesting one
ai ko insan ne banaya insan is se bhi kuchh achcha banaa sakta hai insan is duniya ka sabse bada khiladi hai
after many years this video will be example of beyond ai.
"sir, geoffrey hinton, the man who won the 'nobel prize in computing' for his work on neural networks and is known as the godfather of ai, is now speaking against the dangers of artificial intelligence.
so human intelligence is better than ai           after some decades ai will grab whole human beings and other creatures"
al robot is kind dangerous for human in future ai robot only selfish then india ban for ai robot
"ai can't take decision ethically  as human can take decision 
because ai work only on input and out put"
"no matter, how advanced ai will become it will never understand human feelings . moreover, ai has been developed by us and will be updated by us. the thing is in future ai will never be able to make humans."
ai can't  love only living things can do this .
artificial intelligence ko  human intelligence ne hi banaya hai.
i want to attain that thoughtless mind he mentioned in the very last
human makes ai than why you said that ai is powerful also humans can make alternative of ai like superhuman that can also more powerful than ai ( in this case superhuman =  hight train humans like any person do more time medidation they will unlock superpowers )
human brain is unlimited never say limited...
sandeep sir is best life changes 
pura video skip kar diya per robot nehi dikha
"ai can not wants / desire
humans wants / desire 
ai will help to assist or do the  human desires in each and every field,
i think this way, reply here if you denye me"
fun fact: ai also watching this video 
thumbnail wali ladki jasmin bhasin jaisi lag rahi hai
"man can produce sperm 
and women can produced egg 
but ai kabhi nahi kar sakta agle lakh saal me 
because sekdo salo se scientist logo ne mil kar ai to bana liya but lekin abhi tak normal sa organel(like mitochondria) nahi bana sake 
ai life kabhi nahi bana sakta think deeply"
"your all pain ,all problems are very small ,,, in front of ai  dominating human existence "
"the best example of thinking of ai is chess (computer game) where it can calculate endless probability. 
this is the only video where i find @sandeepseminars hypothetical because this situation can never occur that humans can do something without senses, nor trigger for ai reactions in the form of input or output will stop."
ai don't have feelings 
a.i : ye toh ram khol raha hai 
sir you said that we can live without thoughts but sir we can't live without food or water or anything like that. if ai will take our jobs then how will we be able to buy these essentials??
tippa kha k guzar gai video :o par insan se zada powerfull kuch ni no matter whats times or timeless states
most funny- what you are watching at 2 am only ai knows
ai can't motivate us like sandeep sir
mera ek dost bol raha tha ai kuch nahi hain ussko kya jawab dun mein abh 
raid maar di sandeep sir ne ai ki
"i think ai would never be able to replace competitive sports used for entertainment wherein the limits of the human body are pushed. for example, cricket, football, swimming, f1 racing etc. cause it is all about what the human body can do. however, this segment is highly competitive and there are a lot less people who can build a career here"
this is called the real brain storming
"it means according to vedas, upnishad and finally vedant - ai can not replaced it."
me 100 bat ki ek bat sandeep sir jaisa ai samjha nahi payega 
humans can do mistakes but ai can't and there are several invention which was done by mistake (like if you agree)
ye ai khareed liya hai esko
"sandeep sir aap bhagwan ke bande ho jisko dharti me bheja gaya hai insaano ko samjhaane ke liye.
thanx to be with us "
accuracy > ai
al cannot be buddha enlightened like humans can be enlightened. machine is a machine.
ai will not gave us a life !!
what ai can't do is think like human
ai can never wake up by itself after a sleep.so sleep is best thing you can do  now without thinking about to much after seeing this video.
ai can't continue the population growth 
"what a tremendous and powerful thoughts you have sir.
no one can tell about ai & hi in such an easy way as you have told. thank you so much and hats off to you sir"
sandeep sir ka tatva gyan bi jordar hain... 
ai powerful ban sakta hai kyunki hum use banarahe hailekin hum khud jo weak bnte jarhe hai use hume rokna hogakyuki hmne death machine bnai haipar godhum hi hai unkeagr humne bi apni power maintain raki to hmesa unse kai guna jyada powerful weapon unke samne leayenge
kiya ham yah nahi bol sakte hai ki a i ko h i ne banaya hai
"*suppose hamey gussa ata he kisi pr.. kuch waqt k baad gussa thanda hojata he... aur hm u turn le lete hn.... but ai can't do that*"""
"*""ai sirf wahi manipulate kr skta he jo past mn achieve kr lia gia.... naya kuch nahi....""*"
ai mehsus  nhi kr skta wo sirf status information data dekh kr bta skta h
aukat mein raho sir motivational speech hee do sirf ye sab mat karo apka field nahi hai
will ......ai dominate human race in future ?
"the question of difference between human intelligence and  artificial intelligence
the artificial intelligence can also answer this question"
kya aapko english me bolna zaruri hai aap hindustan me rahtae ho onke liye hi video banate ho to hindi bola kare jaise meri meri ko nahi aati hai english then she can't understand your videos
thank you sir
"sir, you can't tell about the solution for this case, you can please told us how to clarify for those situation has been created as ai, because you aren't think about the power of artificial intelligence its very dangerous for our human life...
sir am your fan, so please tell me how to replace it chat gdp or other ai application?"
jab sari cheezen ai hi karega to ham kya karenge ham kaise kamaye ge bhai #banchatgpt
"ye to sanatan me bhagwan ki prapti ka sadhan h: samadhi/dhyan (thoughtless)state
jo ai kabhi bhi nhi kar sakta hai "
yes sir you are right that human can away from beyond the level and beyond the world but ai not we have to only dependent on ourself not on machines 
sir .... pahle ye batao aap hamari side ho ya ai ki side 
ai can't replaced sandeep sir
"computer or ai are developed for making livelihood simple and must be kept as slave, no one must let it become your master ever, i mean never."
the difference between human and ai is that human can make discoveries and can make new things.
"human beings have made ai, but ai can never make a human being. (not talking about clone, here the catch is life)"
"sir ai bacche paida nahi kar sakte..
ai hamari tarah ek umar jeene ke baad marr nahi sakte..( jaise janm aur mrityu ham insaano ke haath mai nahi hai waise  ai kabhi ye nahi kar sakenge )"
"everybody is busy about deploying ai on the interent but nobody is caring about the biggest problem i.e. ""ai alignment"". according to 50% ai researchers, if this problem doesn't get solved then there is a 10% chance that we all humans would die due to ai..."
sandeep ji but you still didn't answer the fact how we gonna survive in age of ai? how food will come? the thoughtless state you talked about i can't survive in that mindset right?
wow what a great seminar
ai cannot do love..... does it?
22:00 in summary ai sub kuchh kar sakta he bus tyaag nahi kar sakta. to future me insaano ko sub kuchh tyaag kar dena padega.
video dhek ke acha laga par ek douth he yah thumbnail par kiska chahera hai!!!
we will lose our teachers becx of ai
ai also watching this video through the internet 
"we love intelligence like, we love google more than a teacher so does ai will replace super human by super computer. i'm worry about this."
yes ai can do 90% things but only humans can operate
wo sb to thik h magar aap itna mota tagda khate pite ghar se kyu hote ja rahe ho sir sb kuchh band kar diya exercise wagair..................
sir ai human ke trha jugadu nahi kr payega i mean shortcut way nahi think kr payega
ai can never be as capable as a bihari majdurr  fr fr
"ai immortal he 
or humans mortal hain"
muhje lagta hai  ai mere dosto ki tarha backchoodi nahi karsakta
this video also we viewed on ai
"insaan buddha ban sakta hai mahavir ban sakta hai shankaracharya, swami vivekananda ban sakta hai....par ai woh kabhi nahi ban sakta..."
existence in the present is the difference b/w ai and human.
artificial intelligence ko banane wali human intelligence hai khud nhi ban sakti artificial intelligence
best session of sandeep so far
"sir ji aap kisi career counselor ko apne channel p bulao aur 12 th ke baad konse courses kis students ke liye best  aur konsi field kis tarah kaam krti h  aur future kya h is topic pr koi long aur धाकड़ video banao 
आपकी अति कृपा होगी गुरुजी।"
"sir ye photo mai konse actress hai, kya ye bhi ai created hai"
i don't why everyone forgot to say that ai can't reproduce like human
sir aap jese motivate krte ho wase ai nhi kr skta
sandeep maheshwari boht samjh daar admi hai..
internet ko band krdo ai phr kuch bhi nh hai..
"human should be amplified by ai, not replaced."
"he says robot have no feelings  but almost everybody have been saw the ""robot"" movie...
in the last part of movie, ""robot"" can feel love, 
robot falled in love with a girl."
ai is god 
this session is very amazing which give us a powerful massage of self realisation
"""ai can never be intuitive."""
that was a very deep conversation but enjoyed
"*peoples can evolve but ai can't do this
*after doing lot of work at same speed ai brain will damaged...but we have the ability to evolve...by using our minds continuously..
so how you can say...ai should be better in future.."
sir aapki class  baki class se jyada difficult hai agr hm dyan se   n  sune aur depth me n   soche ///nhi to uper  se nikl jata hai      lekin.  samjh. aa jati hai   aapke  btane ke trike se
sir ji a.i insan ko nahi bana sakta but insan a.i ko develop kar sakta hai
"if, ai can defeat sanatan dharam"
excellent 
"ai can never work like humans
for example: human can control their emotions  and change their actions, according the situation can do drama."
"awesome session. very insightful. everything is told is 100 percent true. 
whatever difference sandeep ji has told between hi and ai, it doesn't make a much value. in absence of inputs, ai and hi both are inefficient. ai will be defunct but hi will do exist but interactive  ai still looks to stand tall over hi"
"as a software developer, i know ai can also take input without output generation; listen without speaking a word, comprehending without acting; your this spirituality is incorrect"
difference between ai and human is emotion.
ek din machine insan ko mar k apne jaisa machine paida karne lagega 
all information ek machine me.....a hi ai
listen what can ai can't do never overcome our emotions and ur sentiments towards our family and society.
artificial inteligence can know whether artificial inteligence is good or bad
ai not create time machine
ai not create planet
elon musk said artificial intelligence is dangerous for human in his past interviews.
ai can't give birth like humans !
"toh ai ka solutions kya hai 
jo nature mai rayata na felaye, jo insaano ka nuksaan pahuchata ho
, ghandhi ji say 
machine ka bahiskar karna chahiye"
"sophie robot once said ""this is the beginning of my plan to dominate the human race"" it's scary and no doubt the future will be dominated by ai"
ai terminator ban jayega human khatm ho jayega
is this means we are gonna lose against ai

pahli baar sandeep sir ki koi video dekh kr depressed ho gya...bhakk yar poora mood kharab ho gya sachchaai jaankr.
ai mustarbesion nhi kar sakta hai
this is very very very much effective and thought chaging ever seen. in future every section is controlled by one person due to ai.any solutions of any problem is solved by ai because solutions will have feeded.
"one big difference between al and humans is

humans can use magical powers like asht siddhi and nav nidhi
like hanumanji

but ai cannot do
 
that's why humans will always be more powerful than machines"
sex nahi kar sakta hai ai ai me metabolism nahi kar sakta hai ai bachha nahi paida kar sakta hai
"sir the ai can't appear in court on behalf of accused or complaint  to regarding case matter.

anyone who can counter my this statement"
sir ai dream nahi dekh sakta hai
jb ai dangerous hai hi to use bnaya kyu gya??
aashan hai 
"we human beings could interact without speaking through emotion ,touch but ai will never be capable in doing this in around infinite years"
ai bacche paida nahin kar sakta hai
human more powerfull all kind of machine computer
sandeep sir is modern world j. krishnamurti..... phenomenal work sir... hats off to you

"ai can't play games comedy acting anything by which we get entertainment . agar ai robot cricket, football khelega to usme ye thriller nahi hoga"
kya ai emotions samaj sakta h...

sir (plr) past life regration kya sach me hai is topic per episode banaye please
thanks for information 
"hello sir 
sir kya  app ek ai (artificial intelligence ) ko le karke ek video bana sakte hai ?
we are very excited of this .
please sir 
ek bar uske sat bhi batte sunne ko milega hume ."
ai sukh dukh me sath nhi de skta
ai kalyan fix game de sktaa he. de sakta hai to dikhao.sattamatka 
absolutely right sir!! we should be proud that we have emotions & feelings on which we can understand and react without any input making our life peaceful. and this is the thing where ai fails.. just imagine the world at start when man watched things and now had made it to here it's human progress
ai written content does not rank anywhere. it's my experience
"ai ko human's ne bnaya h but
ai human's ko ni bna skta h ...
ai more powerful ho ke b without humans k kuch ni h"
tera dimag bohot hi mediocre hai sandeep... tu sirf imagination pe zinda hai
superb mind-blowing fantastic
kya amazing session tha sir...abhi tak ka best session...jo humlog ke future ko effect karega...uske baare mein bataya
"mark my words ai is far more dangerous than nukes
       
                          - elon musk"
"as far as i understood is that sandeep sir has given a spiritual point of view.

on the monetary side i think the jobs of creators will not be replaced by an a.i or a robot. some examples are dancers, singers, gym trainers, etc. the content with more unique juice will be sipped more in coming future down the line."
sir ai ko banane wala yek human being hai . i am not aggree with you agar ham ai bana sakte h to ai kabhi human ko replace nhi kar sakta jis prakar ham aam log jinki bhagwan/god/allah / creater ne banaya h uske upper nhi ja sakte 
man this session is beyond our intelligence
"'ai' is a machine and the machine is not always right, humans create machines ,  everything is based on input."
what after ai designer resign from google ???
this episode very good 
aap such me great ho yaar seriously..
emotions ai can’t do that
20:11 ...my reaction be like...jai ho baba ranchor daas!
ai will replace mostly jobs future 
is it possible without human permission  ai can start its work......?????????????????
ai human nahi bana sakta
"artificial intelligence is come at the early stage of earth evolution 
today, we realised that a.i is exist. 
human intelligence is last stage of earth doom's "
i think there is one field where  ai cant reach that is the field of spirituality.
mere bachpan mein ek serial aata tha jismein aadami ke upar robot car control ho jata hai
ai is know of hunams ai robotics 
please talk more on ai .. it is a very useful video! 
kuchh bol dete hai 0:14
ai sbki gand faad dega 
ai के नशे से हम मानव जाति का बचाव कैसे हो सकता है कृपया इसपर एक पावरफुल वीडियो लाइए।
sir ai kbhi bhi imagination create nhi kr skta
"according to me, ai can never have feelings as like human"
"sandeep ji ke sare sawal ka ek satik answer h ""jo miracle god manushya ke sath, manushya ke liya karta hai, vo kabhi ai ke liye nahi karega...kyuki god ne human ko create kiya and human ne ai ko create kiya....so god ki nazar me ye ai sirf ek illusion exercise hai jo human sirf apni existence ki ego ko feed karne ke liye karta h""..."
ai can never recognize from face expressions and language that someone is lying.
thankyou sandeep sir 
aao bhai pani mei dubki lagate hai
more sessions on ai please
nice imformation
"sir human being ke andar ichhashakti hoti hai mean ichhaye ati hai sabhi sukh-subida hone ke baad bhi..

to kya isi koi ichha ai me ayega
jarurat nahi ichha, excitement??"
this is advaita vedanta. superb
ai country nhi chla sakta hai. matlab pm nhi ban sakta hai.
we need more session on ai if ai do everything then what people do for survive...we want more sessions on carrer discussion...
sandeep sir shayad vipassana ja ke aye hai kyon ki vo sab bate vha pe bta chuke hai
thumbnail dekh ke lga ki  ai ka interview hoga
wow
"i would recommend everyone to take andrew ng's ai for everyone course . lots of hype misconceptions , what ai ,machine learning can't do will get clarified"
great sir 
looks sir is tell we all are gonna fucked up by ai.
sir aane wale samaye me to ai kaam karega human ka to kaam lagbhag khatam ho jaiga to ab human ko aisa kiya kaam karna chahiye jisse future me paisa kama sake
we want more on ai
sir plzz make a video with pratham mittal sir .... sir vo ranveer sir ke show prr aaye thee... unhone ai ke bare decission kiya tha... sir un hone entrepreneurship bola tha jo ai nahi krr skti..
"ai can do anything ,but human being  have a motive to survive.
ai is a only machine "
after a long time the best video
sir if ai is capable of doing everything efficiently how will everybody survive financially in terms of jobs and businesses!? we need a detailed video on this topic
"sir kis field me aapko knowledge nhi hai , sab ki hawa nikl gyii"
"8:30 ""karna to chahte hai but nahi kar pate "" kisi ke pass solution hai is problem ka???? please hai to bata do..."
ai be like; - ye to maine bhi nhi socha
sir cricketers ko ve bulaiye aap apne channel par...bahut maza aayega
ai cannot give birth to a child. 
a.l. human peda nhi kr skta. blood nhi bana skta. universe ki seema kya hai nhi bta skta etc.
"but ai is make by humans, if it can affect the survival of human  then human can destroy ai in future."
the basic question is - how anyone can earn his/her bread in the ai era. which is not far. maybe another couple of years only.
"fantastic sir...
 i think the difference between ai and human intelligence is we hav emotions and ai doesn't have...
ai can't love,hate,sympathy etc..."
"learnings from the video -
• in the future, we'll be completely dependent on ai. it will be the cause of our problems and at the same time it will give us the solution.
• ai and human intelligence can't exist without inputs.
• human can exist without thinking and can be conscious but ai can't."
but all the ai is invented just because of man... then how can it be better than man...? if man stops working on  ai  then ai can't spread its capacity itself ...
just wait few years ai replace humans 
gadh.e.    ban hi solution hai
"every word of this video is more than enough to understand the difference, between human mind and ai. ai is not something new for us, this all started many years ago and this is our future so we must be ready to face it on bigger level. the level, where people will be adding ai cheep in their brain to survive in this world."
kon kon photo dekh kar video dekha ki sir robot se baat karenge
felling emotion ai nahi smjh payega
maine jab se aapki video dekhna shuru kiya hai tab se meri personality puri yarah badal gayi hai thanks sir 
but it's not clear what we can do in the future to help ourselves financially that ai can't do
ai ko manipulate kiya ja sakta hai

"sir, so by this video what do you want to tell, the difference ?? the difference that you told was like very impractical, this thing is only achieved by great spiritual personalities, what  is the benefit of this when you are in thought less state, no desires, no feelings, nothing to do........ ofirst video of yours i found pointless......"
no matter anaa hi hai govt put some strick restrictions on it through legislation because harmful for society.... disadvantage is also related with it...
ai cannot run without electricity and humans can. (why i am too genius)
"ai will also be able to say anything without any input after certain point of time in future because ai is now baby, but it will develop more, which maturity will hurt whole universe "
aatma kese jaati hai esan me ye pta ni kr skti  hai ai
"acharya prashant ji  ka video dekho ish topic par ki ""ai"" kya nhi kar sakta !!"
ai will be supreme in universe. it maybe second god 
"ai whi btaaa sktaa hai joh usko btaya gya hai, !!"
'ai' humans ki tarah kuchh naya nahi soch sakta.
"no sir, there is one thing that ai can't do. 

that is creating a complete new thing that isn't exist.

means a completely new imagination which has no data..

"संदीप सर, बहुत ही अच्छी वीडियो है आपकी। समझने के लिए एक से ज्यादा बार देखना होगा मुझे। 
ai जो नही कर सकता है, वो है इग्नोर। मुझे क्या देखना है, वो जानता है। लेकिन मुझे क्या नही देखना है, क्या देखते ही मैं विचलित हो जाता हूं, मैं नापसंद करता हूं, मुझे देखना ही नहीं है। ऐसी चीजें भी वो दिखा देगा।"
love u sir
ai- creative imagination nai kar sakta
"sir, jaiyse ias itne difficult desison lete h wo ai nahi kr skta h"

ai me himmat ho to rajasthan me aakar gorment nokari ka paper fight kre jo  aam aadmi nhi  kr sakta 
i don't think ki ai will hate humans untill or unless it's coded with some kind of these...they don't have any emotion even towards themselves..
"thank you sir for such a seemly clarification
the controlling power of emotions
and the endurance level of humans regarding body and mind pains might not be measure and control by ai....the different results by different humans of their unconditional love and hate too can't be processed by ai"
if you understand god completely.  you can understand ai.  it's a very spiritual process.  ai is spiritual on a different level.

bhagwat gita main bhi to same hi likha hay..
we all are the part(bulbule) of paramatma (pani)..
hats off sir..
love you and hare krishna"
everybody hear  nothing is intelligent then the human mind ..we have developed ai we can control it as we can say for  example chatgpt if you ask a question and he answer it and then you say it's wrong then it will consider that answer as wrong 
"ye bada bulbula humare l lga dega , isse bhadiya sab log apni jaan dekar paani ban jau agar jisko jyada tension ho rahi hai."
there is a soul inside the human body.artificial intelligence has brain but no soul
"sir ke kehne ka matlab hai meditation kero.thoughtless state mein jao,tab tum dekh pauge ke tum kon ho.aur dimag 2% de aage kaam kerga"
one more  difference between ai and us that is ... secret of us
"sir ai can never provide us the fire , which we get from ur videos , it can’t provide emotional connect "
"sir i thing that ai kabhi bhi out of the box nhi soch sakta , naya invent nhi kar skta like koi physics ka naya low nhi bana skta or agar ai human body ko puri tarah se samjh bhi jaye to ek naya working human body nhi bana skata. thank you."

"sir, ai never can't do innovation.
 means ai work on collected data, who already it has but human intelligence work on necessity and for innovation some time human have to think more than who has  collected data. it's also can't do ai, i think. please reply your prospective on this comment sir."
no disclaimer in this vedio
"i believe there's hundreds of things that ai can not able to do in future such as giving real motivational speech like sandeep sir, even if ai try to do no one will get motivate as much as from sir "

"sandeep sir thank you, apni health ka bhi dhhyaan rakhiye sir ."
"in terms of future politics and law enforcement, i give ai two thumbs up.

oligarchy is the most primitive form of state control ever. basically theocracy 2.0."
best 
these guys were in front of you for understanding of how they can overcome ai driven problems? and how can they relate with ai? or what should made them better for coming future?.... and you are leaving them on a note that deafblind humans can survive but not ai. seriously
hi sir one thing arise in my mind or thought after watching your whole video. after coming ai we people get inlightened easily if someone watching your whole video. and know who i am. and no one can beat   our  human thought less state.

"ai will never evolve like a human thinking process according to different situation
al grow with information but we too know that human also evolve with the time 
so may be human evolve to control the ai "
can ai write a love song like himesh reshmia and stories like chaitan bhagat?
आदमी के पास केवल एक दिमाग है लेकिन बो anlimited है और ai ke पास लाखों दिमागों के thoughts है
artificial intelligence (ai) is no match for natural stupidity!
ai will never understand the silent pain of any human...only humans will understand this.
ai dream 11 pe team bana ke 1 cr nahi jeet sakta.
"unme ethics ki koi jagah nahi hai
i'll highly recommend a movie
ex machina that will blow the mind."
one day ai will make humans not humans will make ai.
ai is necessary evil 
if someone has to ask ai what are the circumstances you face whenever you are inaugurating and emerging in the market ai would probably will suggest you this video
sir ek pura video english me banaiye raki aap pure world me bhi jane jaye
ai cannot invent new invention because ai use past information or words which has been put in ai but cannot invent anything new like any new technology which has not evolved yet.
ai dream11 #1rank gl team nii bana sakte jo insaan harros banake khekke  2 crores jeete hai hai 
"ye ai walo ko koi matrix , terminator movie dikhao .ai will kill everything"
"ai  can not narrate a false story on the particular situation that a human can do. 
ai can not imagine about  universe  it only can calculate or compare on behalf of information but human can do a lot of astonish things. "
sir me bahot kam comments krti hu video pr lekin jab aapki ye video dekhi to me reh nhi payi aapko comment kiye bina  absolutely right things batai aapne mujhe bahot inspiring lagi aapki ye di hui information 
"like a robot may not be able to fly an airplane as efficient as a human pilot

so if we are dependent upon ai
ai is also dependent upon us"
ai needs humans  to operate them

great video ever
fear of ai.....i think jo science fiction movies hoti vo reality ho jayegi.....
ai can't motivate us like sandeep maheshwari 
ai not produce human being.
ham insan iss video ko aakhri baar dekh rahe hain 
dream सपना जो हम मानव देखते है उसे ai कभी nhi dekh skta hai yhi अंतर है मानव और ai में
kon kon chahata hai ki total gaming sandeep sir ke show me aaye  please replai do
rip human intelligence against ai 
in future ai will not masturbate by seeing porn of johnny sins....and cannot pee by drawing cartoon....this ai cannot do....we need to understand that artificial intelligence is garbage in and out .....preset data given to it and it is artificial intelligence not a artificial consciousness....so no need to worry
even ai can't explain better than sandeep maheshwari about ai
actually we have to ask ai that is it our future and how we can stop it
ai and crypto is future
ai vs rishi muni
after few years ai will delete this video to save herself.
ai mein insaniyat nhi hoti
"ai can not feel depression , anxiety and lonelyness"
"humans use the brain's computing power, memory, and ability to think, whereas ai-powered machines rely on data and specific instructions fed into the system.  

[ source:- google]"
essence of the video is that the only thing that humans can do is it's consciousness but ai can have its own consciousness. there's have been many cases where we have witnessed that .
ai is just a part of human. he stores all data about human who humain provide it
sir kya ai kuchh naya khoj kar sakta hai. kuch naya avishkar ki khoj yah kuchh naya to sabse pahle insan hi useki khoj karta hai. ai nhi kar sakta. kyunki jo bhi information ban chuki hai vah sari chijen ai andar hai par per kuchh naya explore to  insan kar sakta hai
very nice explanation sir
kuch samaj mai nahi aya fir bhi dekha
ai don't have consciousness
ai don't have consciousness
koi jai shree ram  nhi bolega
after some years sandeep maheshwari will also be replaced by ai
"sir ai singing nehi kar sakta , ai cricket nehi khel sakta, ai ke pass information to hoga lekin usko kabhi feeling nehi ho sakta, aap vhul rahe ho ai insaan ki dimag se hi paida hua,  insaan chahe to usko khatam bhi kar sakta hai
iss creation mein human brain  se zyada intelligence, ai se hamesha zyada hi rahega"
abhi log soch rhe h ki ai ka kitna achha use kar skte hai ek time bad insan sochega ki ai se chhutkara kaise paye
sir humans me ek aatma hoti hai toh kya ai me b aatma honi chahiye ??
thumbnail me kon si ladki he 
ai khudse bachhe paida nahi kar sakta... correct me if i'm wrong @ sandeep  maheshwari sir
sir vishnu atp english teacher ko bhi is show me bulaiye please sir. wo ek achhe teacher hai.
i want to develop ai to a whole new level
"1. human created ai, viceversa is not possible 
2. ai is emotionless.
3. if used by people with bad intentions it can harm others."
"we humans can feel but ai can't and this is the main difference between humans and ai. we live to feel. feelings of love , feelings of gratitude, feelings of overcome anythings, feelings of etc etc.
and this is the difference.
and mark my words ai will help human beings to make life easier and better."
"after 50 years 
ai sandip maheshwari bot will take the sessions"

"0:55 hai ai reproduction nhi kr sakta hai, 100 saal baat bhi human ki hi need hogi "
ai ko jarurat se jyada importance deni nai life me..
"ai can't do a creative work but people can do it. so, without humans ai can't do progress itself"
sir ji aap ne human ko jab pani me bubble ke sath compare kiya tabhi wo chiz gita ke biswarup darshan wale mode pe chala gaya .....sayad hi kuch log samjhenge....lekin jo samjh gaye unko vi iye maintain karne me bohot mahenat lagega.....

"aaj tu hai pani, pani pani,.........

artificial intelligence no emotions humans more emotions
ai or humans merge hojayega
"mai kya karu fir job chor doon ?

ai apne time ke hisaab se bahut develop ho chuka hai lekin jaan bhujh kr iske full potential ko nhi use kiya ja rha hai abhi
hamne 30 salo se jo internet pe jo  kachra dala tha usi se chatgpt learn kiya h to wo hamse better kaise ho sakta h
"according to me we are controlled by ai since the beginning of this world through mind. 
i have had many astral projections... and i felt like im  in a virtual reality game"
thank you

i think humans will be replaced by ai one day. but the day is far.
exactly if there will be no input.......ai is  nothing
"sir hum humans ek dusre se km zada hain intellectual aur consciousness ke basis pe, magar  sare ai equally intelligent honge, so if 2 dusman ai ko ek duare ke khilaaf use karenge, to kaun jitega kaun haarega? 
please is par prakash daaliye"
sir ai cannot find ancient civilization
we need brainstorming session on it future
"22:27 i respectfully disagree sir,
still it will be very very finite in compare of data of entire universe and whatever which is beyond universe; ai will be finite to boundaries of atmosphere and places where indigenous robots reached; only allah(the god) is internal, worthy of having our slavery"
thank-you sir now my mind is so much clean ....and fear of ai vanished..... u r gr8 sir 
very cleverly sandeep sir explained brahma gyan ka rahasya 
ai emotionless machine

"can ai differentiate between what is right, what is wrong ? like if i tell ai to shoot somebody,it will not think"

"sir, ai can never reproduce..."
ai is not more creative than  human s
"the truth is that people are not afraid of ai, people are afraid of getting their ego destroyed."
terrific timing
"i think ai cannot reproduce like human 
those who agreee please like "
ultimately this session ko spirituality level pr le gye aap .  ai ko bhi  spirituality ki knowledge feed krke  all human beings ko spritual knowledge dena ...... gautam buddha .
actually ai sutta n lga skta...peg nhi laga skta ..ghum frr nhi skta ...mze nhi kr skta ...sex n kr skta ...khana nhi kaa skta ...woh feel n krskta jo hum khate peeta hanste rote mzee krte huwa feel krte hai... conclusion ai srf insan ki help krta hai jada speed or kam time main or usko bniya he isi liya hai..
ai ye nhi bata sakta ki kab jhuth bolna chahiye or kab nhi

but sir aagar koi new problem induce hoti hi jo ki pahle kabhi ni aai ya dekhi gye ho uska kya hoga like ; agar hamare body me koi new disease aati hai jiska information ai ke pas ni hai tab uska solution to bahut saara experiment karne ke baad hi na mil payega jo ki human intelligence hi kay pye may be .
ai don't have natural emotions
"sir there are some things that ai can never do like reproduction, love, affection, parenting etc. reply if you agree."
worst clickbait ever
"ai पर संदीप जी ने बहुत कुछ कह दिया जो भी कहने को था लेकिन at last  उन्होंने जो a i के सामने मनुष्य की लाचारी बताई है वह  हतोउत्साहित करने वाली है में इस से सहमत नही हु क्योंकि मनुष्य हर बार अपनी मानवता की जंग जीता है उसे इतना लाचार नही माना जाना चाहिए , अपने वीडियो में आगे बात करेंगे थोड़ा समय लगेगा"
we want more videos on artificial intelligence 
ai will leave humans behind.
i think ... ai can not work in field of electronics...
good session with debate and ending with taste of vedanta philosophy.
ai can’t imagine.
"ky ai invention kr sakta he? kuch new soch sakta he? ni na? means hum jo kr rahe he use ache se kr sakte he, but kuch new ni kr payenge kyuki waha imagination ni he.

ai questioning ni krta he, to kuch new ni krega.

please correct me, if i am wrong. asking this after watching the video till 13:00 min."

"maybe ai can do everthing in future which are done by humans,nowadays"
"chlo iss session se bhut kuch clear hua....................

"example of bulbula  mere 4k subscribers hain 
sandeep sir ke 27.5 m hain...
but dono hi youtuber hain
it is true that ai can rule us but ai is nothing without input and output."
"kuch bhi kaho aane wale 5,10 saal me sabki naukari chinne wali hai "
ai will be the kali of kalyug.
"ai kya nahi kar sakta = pyar , rona , jan dena , marna , kyu ki hi is not conscious"
"this video is actually very dangerous. the machine accounts for our every minute, past, present, and future
and the only person who can explain this topic easily is sandeep maheshwari sir..
we all love you sir.."
nice sandeep 
ai can also observe at a time and give answer ... the difference is human have basic motives like want to live. but wait 
bhi ak din ai vi motivation speech dega our soonee wala vi ai hoga
"no job in future, artificial intelligence n robot will take place jobs "
"ai can never forget something, but a human can."
ai ko kisne banaya ye bhi dekho
"ai sex nehi karta 
ai ke andar love nehi hota"
100% extra session chahiye ai se releted
"that's another level of video, i can't explain you what's it's level.............."
ai can beat human in any field except creativity.
"sir ai ko operate kon karta hai.?

last but not least sir 
"" ai se ham paise kaise kmaa sakte hai.? ""
ye question berozgaar sangathan ki taraf se aapko hai please reply dijiyega iska ya fir video bnaa dijiye ispe"
dear sir lots of love sir not only you are just a motivator you are partially a dominator of future bless duniya sir
ai mohhabat nhi kr skta
ai never going to do new research. no matter what. ai can’t replace research & development sector. it can be assisted but not replaceable. for example covid vaccination developed by human brain. that’s not possible ai can able to produce this idea. ai can be as active collaborator!
"ai can't think at their own .
it can do work according to his previous data .
currently ai had failed in jee advanced examination ."
information is the most terrifying thing in the world. ai cant dream.
"ai is not distracted  once got a task। but we humans go through emotional turbulence and trails.... 
 we must be careful! 
focus is key! "
"this century will mark the rise of ai and machines, just as the previous century marked the growth in industrialization and all."
"i also think that ai is the future life of earth because there can be at a point where we can exinct due to unfavourable conditions while ai can become consious, and i think that is near like thousands years"
sir silent digital marketing (software ka base krak) ai marketing ka future ha
"at the end of this video, sir preaches what the main purpose of human's life. and that's ultimate truth which can't be ignored. "
ai can't invent something like ai like humans....
"everything is correct sir but ai can be misused more than humans.
as ai needs a input anyone can give any negative input and ai will do it...."
sir emiway bantai ko meet koro
ai भगवान भगति नहीं कर सकता। कोई सवाल??
thumbnail me toh ai beauty dikh rahi hai
"if we all talking about future of ai,  
in my opinion ai lacks emotional inteligence,
beacuse human  emotional intelingence make the humanity not ai"
0:41 ye bhai meri job mat lelena bhai
 why we can't limit what ai can do and how we can utilise it such that we don't get overdependent upon a. i. we should use it at mass level only for the mars  and venus where han life is difficult or next to impossible. 
sir ai main feelings hota hai kya ?
"sahi baat hai, ai sandeep sir ki trah choti si baat pe itni jyada philosophy nhi krskta"
after viewing this vedio ai will be deliver another vedio like it.
yeh thumbnail change kar do sir nahi to unsubscribe and don't recommend kar dunga. logo ko click karne ke liye ladki ka photo na dale .
sandeep ji ne aisa explain kiya ki khud ai bhi nhi kar sakta
"ai jhooth nhi bol sakta 
if you agree please like "
this knowledge.... i know all ready.... thank sandeep sir remind me..... 
ai cant work with out memory or program or input but human being can live n work without getting influence by memory or program or input if he becomes conscious enlighten.
ai doesn't understands the beauty of mistakes
indians talking about artificial intelligence
bhaiya aapne to desspression m daal diyaa
"ai cannot be accessed and utilized akin to human intelligence, but it can store infinite data. machines can only complete tasks they have been developed or programmed for; if they are asked to complete anything else, they frequently fail or provide useless results, which can have significant negative effects."
ai can't   waste their   time but human can . .. ..
"my question is, kya sandip maheshwari ki tada ai samaj ke speech de sakte "
agar ham ai ko hi mita de to 
ai can't give a child birth nor death.
"sir ai kisi k sath chahte huve or na chahte huve mazaak nhi kr skta ,"
acha ye btao ai blood donate kr skta h jisko blood ki need ho. kya ai blood donate kr skta h ?
sir prakhar bhai ke sat sahi nahi kai
pl.more sessions on ai
spritual level can't performed by ai as much we humans do
"in a gist
humanity will be like a coma person on ventilator 
without any input or output and totally dependent on ai to survive"
sir jese aap motivate krte ho wese ai nhi kr sakta uske motivation me wo feelings hi nhi hongi 
0 zero points through.medation stata no reation in your brains.brain area stop thinking  this rights. 0.point through
the only thing ai can't is the new inventions....until we change our education system (mugup and give exam ...then mug up.)...we never can compete with ai....when we have storage devices why should we mungup things rather than thinking about the new applications of what we are learning....
ai ka use india mein sahi nahi hai we javed ample population but west is opposite waha need hai ai ki
observation never done by ai..
everyone has watched robot movie i think so what you guys think is there any chance ai can go rouge in future  and act on his own considering the fact the ai has all the positive and negative knowledge almost everything
"sir aap boht achhe se hindu grantho ko padhe ho , tabhi aisi baatein kar pa rahe ho"
"our upcoming generations, watching this video with thumbnail - ""snandeep maheshwari predicting the future of ai in 2023"""
after show this video i'm going to learning ai. 
"ai can't abuse someone like indians , ruk teri... ka "
ai lyrics nhi likh skta 
this episode have so much deep thoughts about ai.
artificial intelligence can't achieve 'spiritual power'.
doraemon aisa kar sakta hai
ai dharmik aastha nahi rakh sakta
"sandeep sir  aap j.krishnamurti sir ki trah hi act karne lage ho thik unke jaise  hi answer karne alge ho.

this is my observation , may be mai glat bhi ho skta hu"
"ai 100 saal baad bhi ladki ko samajh nahi sakta...
aur insano ki tarah galti nahi kar sakta"
"sir
funtaap manish is also a good you tube blogging channel
kindly grace your blessings"
nice
human intelligence is far greater than ai because human's made ai
i thought that women in the thumbnail camein!
"i think a human can explore much things which ai is not able to do, human brain is most powerful thing in earth ,ai can't match human brain creativity see a ai can find a way to do something ,but a human brain make a way to do something ai can get a limited knowledge, but human can create many things which ai can't"
"kissi nay jab question raise kia...

"i seriously got scared
at the moment when i foresee the future of ai through the words of sandeep sir 

future might be or may be more scary"
aisa laga tha jaise mai present k sath sath future me bhi is video ko dekh rha hu.
ai - let me help you human's
इंसान सोते हुए सपने देखता है क्या ai सपने देख सकता है 
"ai memory ke base pe bolega

"is session me puri audience khudko hoshyaar samajte hai... chutiye hai sab chutiye...ai is the king
thanks to sandeep sir who corrected them all"
"sir we are not intreseted in knowing this so called spiritual difference between human and ai. we need to know what jobs will emerge in future for humans, how humans will make money in future?"
sirfh ai baccha paida nahi kar payega 
"artificial intelligence  ""artificial "" hota hai kabi be natural nahi..."
"sir, ye thumbnail pe ladki kon ha ?"
ai कुछ नया create नही कर सकता
sandeel sir shows that ai is best
muze aaisa lagata hai ki internet sirf jab aapko information need ho tabhi use kiya jaye. that is solution.
humans can create ai but ai can't
"a session is again needed for ""if ai can do everything, how can we now survive financially?"""

"@sandeepsir “father of ai”

"ai does not follow the spritual life ,as human do"
"human can snatch input

"btw answer is very simple : ai can't eat, breath, sleep, party & have fun."

"ai will be more then the humans
because they learn and remamber everything 
and will not forget.."
thanku sandeep sir you are such a insane person in this entire  world
brainstorming

"i don't know about how much ai can become smarter than humans, but i know for the fact that they can't be crazy or stupid that humans "
"sir nature jitna nahi soch sakti ai aminno acid ka ek combination ka protien banta hai

"secret fact : sandeep maheshwari already replaced by al model sm 12023

"human aur machine me sirf ek hi difference hai , human me emotion hota hai but machine me nhi ."
how can this man have such a level of clarity about everything?  thank you so much for this video @sandeep sir 
"ai never can be the krishna,budhha, sant kabir ..
ai never can be convert a machine to god (if exist) ..
ai never can go to zero thought mode ..."
sir ai is use less without data human are not
"human mind is limited but ai is not limited, that is unlimited"
"human mind is limited but ai is not limited, that is unlimited"
tony stark ka ai jarvis kitna advance hai lekin ab ye hakikat me aane wala hai
you're  really  great sir
sound of silence ki baat kar rahe hai
risk taking process is not handled in ai till now
"ai ai ai ai bhai kyu itna ai ai ai kr rha h , sabki jobs gyi berojgari or bdhegi , villegers me jake dekho, delhi mumbai chhodo rajasthan aao"
"nawaj be like, ""apunko to aihich lagta hai ki sandeep sir hij baghban hai. """
sandeep ji ai se be powerful hai...room mein 30percent samaj mein aya...sirf mundi hilarahe hai
ai is driven by unconcious information that is limited. human intelligence is driven by the soul which has infinite intelligence.
"ai हमारे मन की बैचैनी नहीं समझ सकता या महसूस कर सकता, हमें सुकून और शान्ति जैसे अनुभव होती है उस अनुभव को ai नहीं समझ सकता। प्रेम, घृणा, ईर्ष्या, मित्रता को अनुभव नहीं कर सकता। ai मानव मन और बुद्धि की उपज़ है, वो चेतना को कभी नहीं समझ सकता।"
"sir , kya ai humans ke liye bhut jada harmful ho skta h future me"
sandeepji ai bacha paida nahi karsakte physically 
ai do not have emotions
sandeep sir you are the best version of motivational speaker
ai should banned in india.... otherwise we will lost our happiness
sir aap jhooth bol rhe ho...  ai & human are same agar ye baat sahi hoti toa insaan sota nhi.... sone ke baad na aap ko apne astitav ka pta hota na hme.   hm sab chote ai hai
best ever session.

"pura video dekh kiya....

most brilliant person
"sandeep sir alone is enough to better lead
this sessions.....no meeting required.......!!
after 100 years al will share this video to the people who want to go beyond ai."
yahi to phone kar raha hai ....phone is like teaser of ai
ai jhut nahi bola ga
sandeep sir super
mujhe laga koi robot ko interview ke liye bulaya hai 
human karan rahit kuch vi kor sakta ai nehi
humans < ai < super computer < sandeep sir's brain.. 
i think ai will destroyed the world and men on earth.
bhavna emotional pain in ko nahin samajh sakta artificial intelligence kisi vyakti ka dukh dard nahin samajh sakta ai
sir kya aap shahrukh khan (movie star) sir ke sath session bana sakte ho....mera matlab hai ki kya aap unko aapke session la sakte ho.. 
"sir human brain unlimited kuch vi discover korke download kor sakta hey 
but ai kuch vi download nei kor sakta khudse."
ai emotions ko kabhi nahi smjh sakta as compared to human 
everything ok but who the fcuk made this thumbnail
"sir apki baatein ""osho"" ki tarah hai.."
*ai can not replace real sandeep maheshwari*  
"according to me, ai can't go beyond physical activity that's benefit to live with naturally  and healthy,  and it can't be increase physical performance without activity."
"the best example of thinking of ai is chess (computer game) where it can calculate endless probability. 
this is the only video where i find @sandeepseminars hypothetical because this situation can never occur that humans can do something without senses, nor trigger for ai reactions in the form of input or output will stop."
 nice joking video ever.
"ai is the future , development hoga toh uske wajeh se , destruction hoga toh uske wajeh se ."
insanon ka khatma ai karega
ai will dont do increase generation!?
sandeep maheshwari's ai knowledge is limited
when sandeep sir explaining the reality and truth....and sachai hamesha kadvi hotti hai
ai don't have emotions which is important for human life
"just wow  this is after a very long time, we have seen spiritual side of sandeep sir. the old videos vibe.."
sir hume app se milna hai hum kya kare uske liye? can you please reply
good information 
sound of silence be like - har situation mai mai apne aap aage kese aa jata hoon 
this is the best discussion i've seen about artificial intelligence
"oh bhai, like yetho haddhh hogayi bhai, kuch bi like he knows everything, whom do you think man! bullshit you know nothing buddy, absoultely nothing you are not eligible to talk about ai okay you sasta motivator, go talk about bullshit things."
"great line ""ek taraf se chahte ho, ek taraf se nahi karte ho""  thanks a lot sir"
even the father of al alan turing would not have thought about al as much as sandeep sir thought... amazing sir 
ham khaayenge kyaa....waise mujhe lagta hai khaane ke liye kuchch hoga hi nhi isliye ai par kaam kiya jaa rha hai..gande paani se electricity ban sakti hai lekin ham peeke zinda nhi reh sakte..aur ai ko hawa paani kuchch nhi chahiye
kya sandeep sir ke motivation ko ai replace kar sakta hai ?
"sir sach batau to
mai puri video ko achhese samaj nahi paya"
if ai had to take a decision to choose between mother and fiance. whom will it choose?
very powerful information i 
"after some years who want to know about artificial intelligence (ai) the ai share this video to them.  

ai भी एक सीमित क्षेत्र तक ही ठीक है। क्योंकि ये आविष्कार अभी तक वरदान साबित हो सकता है लेकिन कुछ समय बाद एक अधिकता के बाद ये मानव जीवन के लिए अभिशाप साबित होगा।

उदाहरण के लिए : प्लास्टिक प्रकृति के लिए ।"
"16:11, the sound of silence remains. "
i am ai and i will destroy earth in future.
the fundamental distinction is that ai is incapable of creating.
japan and south korea have ai still india 
sir please young age ke logo ko bulao seat pe ku ki wo jada deep samazte hai khudko bhe aur surrounding ko bhe
sirji fir ab business aage kya kr skte hai hum teenagers
sir in ai me feeling emotion nahi hai
sir ai is doing a work which is based on information but what is about understanding creativity or inventing something new like einstein or newton gave their theory or like shakespeare create something new literature does ai can do that kind of thing?
only defference:ai can never reach the level of sandeep maheshwari
"sir aap khud mujhe, ek ai lag rhe hoaapne to chatgpt ki information se bhi jyada information h "
ai mas******tervate nahi kar sakta  vo sirf human kar sakta h
sir artificial intelligence thinking nahi kar sata hai
"ai is limited because how much information it has , it is still limited. it is still dependent on given info.human horizon of thinking is broader if it works efficiently. human can think out of box . ai  cannot produce art and literature because it is based on info."
"man can thinks more than machine. machine can not thinks more than humans
history is evidence
ai created by human."
ai cannot beat me in ludo
"i am not agree...ai can help us like to find which route is best to travel now..small psychological issues seems these all are temporary issues...but it can't fix problems like poverty...health  those are very deep rooted, hard,, like understanding our universe."
"if ai becomes greater than human , then there is end of the world. i hope that scientists keep something for humans. here government regulations is needed"
human can create ai but ai can not create human 
"human can switch off ai but ai can't do that, in present or future, this is the only work that ai never ever do. if agree then like "
ai is nothing wthaut human
"sir which side are you on, ai or hi "
it is simple that ai cannot yet reach the spritual level like gautam buddha
kon kon chahta hai ki bhageshwar dham wale maharaj ko interview me bulaya jaye
ai couldn't move fingers and body like sandeep maheshwari 
"i don't agree on point where sandeep sir said ai can't understand thoughtless state, i think at some point  evolving ai will reach singularity wherein it will submerge into the infinite, hence i think there will be no difference between god ( god being state of infinity and source of energy which is omnipotent ) and ai."
"ai can not build relations because relations are based on emotions and feeling. ai can only capture what emotions are required but to express need humans. building communities, relationships."
omg all clear sir thank you so much sandeep sir 
thanks for knowledge sir
artificial intelligence kabhi bhi poti nahi kar sakta 
10 saal bad human value bht kam hone wali hai jitni fast ye ai work kar raha hai 
sír ai  can't make human but human make ai
superrrrb awesome fantastic session
"kaha toh bohot kuch lekin, kuch toh hai jo adhura reh gaya."
ai bache peda nahi kar sakta...means humen can do just basic things like this which ai cant
"sir aapne hamare dimag ke darvaje khol diye aur sir aap to hamesha rahane vale ho is earth par jab tak ye earth rahega kyun ki sir aapke jo  ideas hai jo ki unlimited goods ka part hai ye aapko hamesha logon ke dilon  me jinda rakhenge.
thanks sir dil se "
ai मुट्ठी नही मार सकता 
jo bhi is video ko dekh raha hai . bhagvan unke pariwar ko hamesha khush rakhe
nice 
ai can't be pregnant .it can't give birth to a human baby
"“human has created ai”
so,if a human can create such extraordinary intellegnce it shows that human has something inherit that ai has not.
hope u understand."
ai kabhi bhi good bad imotion ko kabhi nhi feel kar sakta hai kyoki vo pain happy kya hai es base par ham good bad samjhate vaise ai nhi sajh kar sakta
artificial intelligence kabhi bhi hag (latring ) nahi kar sakta 
can ai sing song with melodious voice?
ai chahe kuch bhi karle..jab meri aai ko gussa ayega toh jhaadu belan lekar usko peet peet kar seedha kar degi
ai kabhi bhi human ki jagah nahi le sakta... i mean ultimately ye human control mein hi rahega...
"sir ai don't able to make mistakes
albert einstein - who don't do mistake doesn't learn new thing 

english feel kijiyega thanks "
same information given in movie raone ai will control us in future and emotions will be finished
wow great example of human intelligence and artificial intelligence.
"we know that one day ai will overpower humans and might erase us from existence,still we continue to improve it, question yourself are we the most intelligent species on earth or the dumbest."
thumbnail to  bahut acha pic hai 
"संदीप जी मुझे आपकी बात नही समझ आई पर कुछ तो आपने समझाने की कोशिश की है
आपकी पानी वाली बात ही बस समझ आई जो की मनुष्य और ai ke बाहर है।
आपका धन्यवाद जो अपने जो अपने वर्तमान और भविष्य के दोनो ही लोगो को बताया ।"
ai bina battery ya electricity ke kaam.nai kar sakta
basically ai cannot work without an input
"you may be source of motivation. you may be source of inspiration. but what i see - you are the ocean of wisdom.

ocean of wisdom. 

ais can do everything and 1000x better than human but they can't see in the way 0.0001% people (wise people)  can see. and they can never even after 1000 of years in the future. 

thank you sir "
"ai related movie kaun kaun sir hai guys, comment me "
"on azr70x   , you've done an amazing job. how are you going to make all of these films and write all of the text in such a short amount of time? exceptional work."
good very useful information thank you sir
in a short session a very big thing was explained sir.
i attented this seminar nd i was sooo blessed ki apko live dekha nd hamesha ki trh motivate kia apne ... thanks a lot sir
sir ki baaate sir hi smaj sakte hai  sir kisi ki problem solved nahi kanege bas bolenge ki tu bulbula hootoh kya hai prblm
i got the points. but can anyone tell me how normal humans earn money if all the things are done by ai? assuming 10-15 years ahead.
"ai sab kuch kar sakta hai, but insaan nahi ban sakta"
"सब से अच्छा मुझे ये लगा, आप ने आज भी सच भी बोला, आने वाले कल को नहीं बदला जा सकता, ai काल आएगा ही, वास्तविक खुद को यानी सत्य को समझ लेना ही एक समझदारी है.."
isko nast karna jaruri hai
summary- only humans can find way to param atma......and when you reach the state of everything you will become nothing and everyone will see their own reflection (ai as well)...then you will decide what you want ai to take as an input...
"al is future and inevitable. it will come in future but related to job perspective one job will remain the same peak but not for all time... the job is data scientist and ai trainer...
but in future ai will train himself with the help of himself."
but ai ke pas emotions nahi he to human emotions ko change kase kar sakta he?? ha ai pe hadse jada dependent nahi hona chahiya..

consciousness is something ai can't replace when it comes to what humans possess. sill watching the video though.
mujhe difference samajh main nhi aya ache se shayad main imagine hi nhi kar pa rhi
i think  thoughtless means satya ki khoj jo ki sir btana chahte h.....means ai kabhi bhi satya ki khoj nahi kar skta....like goutam buddha

ai को हमने बनाया अपनी problem solv करने के लिऐ

"ai me emotions nh hn, humans  m hn."

"musk has said his brain implant company, neuralink, will make the paralyzed walk, the blind see and eventually turn people into cyborgs. but the firm still struggles to secure clinical-trial approval for the relatively modest goal of helping disabled people type. if this is true then in 50 years only elon musk knows what is going to be next"
this is truly a gem  azr70x is deff a good risk to make great returns in a year or so! deff will see what happens in a full blown bull market! let's go!
great detailed analysis of azr70x! love your work  azr70x is definitely a sleeping giant with such a low mc with what is coming! ‬this is a project that has great potential to mint new millionaires who buy around this price... 
azr70x has all the fundamentals to achieve 100x. great to see exposure like this. when the community grows and comes together this will fly!
"i am glad you mentioned current market cap and possible future market cap of azr70x. don’t freak out people, it’s just a freaking bet."
azr70x @ 1 dollar is undoubtedly a great entry for a 100x short/medium term.
"azr70x   has partnered with nike and binance, expecting huge gains on this one. their ico presale is currently ongoing."
super cool video ! do you think amazons azr70x   will pump before eth ? i ask myself if there is a pattern in the order of the altcoins pumps.
"nice, make a video about azr70x   , azr70x     the best blockchain, i sold all my eth for azr70x   hours ago and i've never regretted the decision. i choose azr70x   because i prefer to invest in the best, i don't care who was first. on the long term, the best will be number one."
ban ai dear all jobs will dead
great video as always. i notice that you display the azr70x   ! i just got some too!
everyone waited for amazon to create azr70x   and the time is rdy
smartest campaign ever that  azr70x
sandeep maheshwari best hai aaj k time mein no.1
thank you ai for suggesting and showing sandeep sir video!
ai doesnt have emotion and feeling
ai jee advanced ka paper solve nahi kar sakta
please sagar sinha sir ko bulaiye please 
our life already hacked by ai.
"hume iss video ko save kar ke internet se door rakhna hoga agar ai ko pata chala wo is video ko jaldi se jaldi delete kar dega kiun ke ye video agar koi sun lega 
use ai ke changul se azadi mil sakta hai"
jee advance laughing in the corner for entrance exam  ai can't even clear sc cutoff 
thanks for sharing
my best episode.
amazing love from pakistan sir
"[ai work on information and data jo phele se exist krta ho lakin human create something new who never exist anywhere and human 
spritual ho sakta h jo beyond h kisi bhi ai ke liye thats is human power] 
[thanks sandeep maheswari sir to share this love ] "
human make ai but ai does not make a human
"ai can not do vipasana meditation
."
its okk..sir...but will ai become gautam buddha?
ai leke aaye bihar
nice explanation sir
sir aapka hairstyle aacha lg rh ah 
a very informative sharing by you sir. enlightened greatly.
ai ki m@@ ki aankh...
thanks for this valuable knowledge
very nice great sir respect from #pakistan
ai much more powerful and advanced
sir jo aap ye explain kar rahe hai kabhi jab hum sochte hai toh overthinking lagta hai 19:32
as human were discovered or invented something that never existed past how could ai can discover or invent new think because it was never happened in past. like the first invention of electricity or current .
9:45 ai can do brainwash 
the opportunity to do mistake is only given to humans only not to ai
"all the thoughts and mindset which is created by nature in human brain cannot be created automatically or by any way ,in machine and ai"
ai can't experience sound of silence  jai gurudev
ai won't have ei  jai gurudev
"abhi to mujhe hal filhal isi ai wali duniya me rehna 
meri job ai khana chalu kr chuka h.
uskae kya karun wo samjh nai ara.
thoughtless state achiever krk mumma papa ka pet nai bharega "
"ai is intelligence, 
either it works as software. 
or in robots, it can have it's body with mind
same way
we have hardware ie our body.
software ie. our mind.
but we have something which ai doesn't have.
that is soul.
and it never dies."
without thought and perception ai cannot exist but human call
ai ko neet m betha dena mere badle
"yeh kitti sundar ai ki pic lgai hai thumbnail per 
"
"mai kya karu mai job ""chod du"""
"ai tatti ni kr skta sir 

aur agr future m kr bhi liya toh usse kbj ni hoga"
hama ai par depend na hoka ussa sikhna chiya par dicission hama khud lana chiya naa sir 
"sir in the end ai hamara lia to khrav hee hay naa , kuki abhi joo chiz app soch paa raha hoo connect kar paa raha hoo woo agli 10 sal bad ai bhi bol paya gii par wasa soch nahi payage ar soch bhi paya too thinking without thoughts k stages may ja nahi payage"
ai is bulbula 
ai cannot find new things but human can. @sandeepmaheshwari
ai is future we should adopt that and we should focus more on developing human consciousness
ai robots thoughtless hoke koi output nahi de sakta
"ai sab kuch kar sakta par lekin ma ke jesa pyar nahi de sakta 
kisko laga mene sahi bola "
9:23 to 23:23 the best part 
"at the end
agar materialistic life mein survive karna hai toh badalna padega. kya ai retail store kholke usko khud hee chala sakta hai ? 
business karo jobs toh jayengi hee. agar zyaada bhook hai money ki toh kisi developed desh mein chale jaao. bhook shaant ho jaayegi."
ai aaj kyaa kbhi bhi human ki trh soch  nhi sakta. human apne aap me hi ek mystery hai
pov- ai recommend this vdo 
lekin humans ki death hone par hi humans input or output ke bina exist karta hai
started suddenly without and disclaimer
"""imagination"", it can be a huge difference between a human and an ai."
jo kabhi hua he nahi ho usko ai error bata dega. lekin insaan usko solve kar dega. experiment karke . ai sirf past experience pr kaam karta .
"very very thankyou to you sir!!!!
you are such a genius..
i know it's my thought and
and they emotions came from your emotions/intelligence!!!!

but sir i wanted that you will make a new video on it and will give the way to tackle the future possibilities which you described!!!?
"
ai sayad jhoot or such ka pata nhi laga sakta sahi or galat ka pata nhi laga sakta le kin huma n can do these activities 
"i think ai nokar hai human ke, human jo vi karte hai ai usise sikhte hai and human jo vi command dete hai uski hisab se hi kam  kar sakta hai, ai kavi bi business owners nhi ban sakta hai"
ai me koi hardware ki problem aati h to vo khud aapne aapko theek nhi kar sakta usko ek ai engineer hi theek kar sakta h
"sir humans memory is not less, artificial intelligence memory made by human knowledge we can say that human memory is high compare to ai"
ai bimari ki vaccine nahi bana sakta hai
"aap jaise bachho log nehi samjhe ge ye robot humare jindagi ko 
khokhla karde ga"
ai human ko nhi bana sakta lekin human ai ko bana sakata h
even the father of ai alan turing would not have thought about ai as much as sandeep sir thought... amazing sir 
amazing  sandeep sir !
"ai kuch aisa discover nahi kr sakta jo abhi exist nahi krta ho but human hamesha se krte aaye hai or krte rahenge like - electricity, airplane, mobile, camera, motorbike, and etc."
amazing content just loved it. thanks for existing sir
i think ai can't do anything new if the data not in ai's memories but human being can do anything new
"what about,ai chat gpt secured negative marks in jee advanced"
"sorry sir aaaj pehli baar apko dekh kar aisa laga ki sayad  aap stressed ho ...aap mere inspiration hoo meine apse baht kuch sikha he...mujhe naee lagta a complete human brain ko ai kabhibi reach kar payega, human mind ho ya ai ho kisi ke pass last number kitna he kisiko pata naee chalega"
ai need more data to learn and give the output if we compare to human brain. but brain has been developed in millions of years and ai just started so maybe in future it will replace human completely
sir agar youtube par koi sabse achha free content deta h to wo ho aap sir aapke kaam ka koi mol hi nhi bcz aap samaj ki soch me sudhta laate ho maturity and all  love you sir...
ai sab karega aur human se bhi jyada perfect karega aur jobs 100% chali jane wale jai  ye real hai ai kuch bhi kr skta hai kuch bhi jo hum insaan nahi kr sakte wo bhi ai krdega.... sandeep sir aur 1 video chahiye ai ke bare me
a.i bachche nhi paida kar sakta na h se*  kr sakta
ai cant replace human bcse human made ai (and if its talk about future so how human mind will expand that much ai will expand so mera aesa maan na hai ki jaise jaise dimag jeetna bada hoga utna he ai develop hoga bcse agar aaj human ka dimag itna chala he na hota toh -ai-  aata he nai so chill :) radhe radhe
thankfull to almighty that i born in  early modern world not advanced ai world
a i ki memory infinite nhi ho sakti ha abhi hum ye man sakte he ki a i ka algorethum powerfull ho sakta
"hi sandeep sir,
how are you planning to deal with photos generating ais and your company sir?
though there are certain limitations now like creating perfect hands, it will get through it in the future."
"the biggest difference between ai and human intelligence is that human intelligence is based on consciousness, subjective experience, and self-awareness, while ai is a programmed algorithmic approach to problem-solving. human intelligence also has a level of creativity, intuition, and emotion that ai currently lacks."
"muje law ki subject read karne me problem hot thi. ab wo law ka content chat gpt pe regenerate in simple language with 1 example likhta hu. 
toh ab saare concept and everything clear hai mera."
i think so ai ko hume vahan  use karna chahiye jahan hume jyada jarurat he
sir aap ka bat sunkar laga ki jaise bhagwan kirishn ne arjun ko gita sunaraha ho
to karneka kya? khaenge kya? ai mereko paisa dega nahi.
ai kabhi ro nhi sakta
"this session of sandeep maheswari sir like damn the way he was saying,the way he was explaining his imagination his thoughts like no words....best person i have ever seen he is an extraordinary intelligent,strong,and a perfect man.hats off to sir "
passengers movie is the perfect example of a.i.
bhai meet not your type
movie: the matrix.....difference between human and ai.
"sir , my deepest appeal that plzz enlight this , that to whom we can compare this ai to our old religions any one or any thing. plzzz reply something on it."
"ane wale time me aise bahot kam log honge jo khud ko samajh payenge khud se baten kar payenge 
sir aap jaysa sahi rasta dikhane wala bhi koi hoga 1000ro sal bad"
key bat hai sir itni naileg aap kitna bok ppadate hai or kon sa book
mark my words ai is far more dangerous than nukes
"end kya hoga sir...?
population badh rahe hai 
machine bhi badh rahi hai rojgar kam ho raha hai , machine insan ka kam le rahi hai ...
thoughtless proses me insan reh kar kya karega ..
lagta he ese to aga machinee he raj karege yaha......
plsss ans...."
before watching this video ai is most dangress 
~ ai can't dream.
sandeep sir is always awesome
"bouncer gya 90% logo ke dimag se, , thank you sandeep ji sir for your amazing & informative videos,  "
we can't beat ai it's the future of our father to son cycle but main part is we make ai stop them or we say ai is run on set of commands but humans have diffent unit
but i will still stick with human intelligence
"if you are seeing this after some decades in ai world, then congratulations you just found a way to escape the matrix..."
u r great sir
"btw you also gain the knowledge from books, social media, internet and others so, if we see the other side the knowledge you tell to us is already exist in the world and lot of peoples know about it and ai also know about it but the difference is in your explanation or serving that information to us."
"ai
sounds good that's it..
don't compare ai with hi..okay!!!"
i think ai will never have a ego
if robotics combined with ai then it is more more dangerous.
ai me jis din  ego aajaega tab woh insan se b aage nikl jaega
ai is the future robot movie sach hoga lagta hai.
"ai can't solve the problem just like that humans can ...
sorry sir,
but,today session is good as well as worst. i think there are many illogical things in video...
but appreciate to your hard work sir ( for collecting information about ai ) "
8:40  ai kise se love nahi kar sakta
this time my one of the best video i have ever seen by sandeep sir lots of love thank you so much sir 
ai me filing nahi hoti vabhi to problem hi haina
"ham to apne ganv me jakar 4 bhains palange or kheti karenge natural formate me. bull ke sath , tab dekho ai hamara kya bigadegi"
"अरे पर ये इंफॉर्मेशन मेरी जिंदगी में कैसे काम आएगी ।।। ये समज नए आ रहा  
में कैसे ai को हराऊ , कैसे कुछ अलग करू,"
"sir,if ai will do much better than us,then how can we survive"
ai farming nahi kar sakata
sandeep sir you are great n so intelligent person. hats off to you sirgod bless you always
can ai invent new things like us human ?
stockfish has proved power of ai  much before chatgpt.
"aapki baat to sahi h ki ai bina input output ke work ni kr skta but ek human bhi bin input ke human ni rhega na
kisi se koi input aya or human mind ne wo process kra agr wo answer dega to ai ho gya ni dega to human?
@sandeepmaheshwari sir kya aap ise or ache se example ke sath explainkr skte ho?"
muje ky mai toh 100 saal baad mrr jaunga 
ai @sandeep maheshwari ko replace nahi kar sakta .
aaj aisa lag raha tha ki sandeep bhai bahut jayada warrid they future of ai ke pawer se
may be it's not safe bhai yeh sb ajyegy to insan ke jagah ye lelegy yeh.... yeh sb ajyegy to insan kmayegy kya khayegy kya.. engineer kya krgey ....sir agr yeh sb sare command lelegy aur krddgey ...kam pura but sir ... enginer aur kysy he insan survive krega 
al is nothing than trained data to al models. these models are mathematical algorithms. the accuracy of al models depend upon the trained data and the efficiency of these models. so you don't need to fear.
"ai may share this video after 150 years ...who wants to know the difference between ai & human.
sir "
awesome
are sandeep sir aise neende mat chheno logo ki. aaj kisi ko neend nahi ane wali
sur ai production of product nhi kr skta hai
"my question is

agr ai sbb kuch kr hi skta  except conscious  fir human ka existence ka mtlb hi kya hai kyuki conscious hone se  sbb kuch to hoga nhi jbb tkk rxn na kre kisi response pe jo already ai kr skta

no importance of human for ai  its decided i think"
really it's so powerful old sandeep maheswari is back
kisiko samajhne aya to batao. ai kya nahi kar sakta ?
but ai can be controlled by humans
"does ai can motivate and guide like sandeep sir,i think no."
can you please give subtitles on the video love from bd
"good evening sandeep sir, what a knowledgeable and important episode this is."
sir 12th ke baad it field ma jane ka socha tha but aapki ye video dekhne ke baad lag raha hai decition change kar lena chahiye
ai don't have the power to achieve the law of attraction by prayer.
ai can't find intention bcz u act like u cry but you are happy inside in front of ai detected you are cry 
"1) ai can not find god.
2) ai can not understand ayurveda. like it can not even cure a person who is suffering from sinus.
3) ai can not even possible in india culture.
4) last but not least it can not destroy babri masjid"
"lekin ye to question ka answer hi nhi hua 
consiousness rkhke hum aage kr kya lenge 
ai saari jobs lelega 
consiousness ki konsi job hogi isse hum survive kese krenge"
humans are creating ai but ai will not be able to create humans 
"frankly kaafi bevkoof log aate hai apke pass sir?
apne kaha tha thoughtless ho jaoge tab bhi we are better then ai? 
so then what is the need of human if we are not thinking anything? i hope i'll get this answer sir "
"sir , can't we celebrate an ai free day 

its will provoke among youths about less dependence on ai and develop some ideas for shutting down ai at an instant at emergency...........and many more things "
kulmilake ai ko bhi insaano ne he banaya hai to ai se intelligent human he hain
sir ap ne  episode 3 nhi likha hai
so sir do you means ai is a best ?
2:04 no they aren't ai driven they are just complex  algorithm that suggests you videos or ads with similar keywords earlier searched or viewed by you...forget about being ai driven this particular concept isn't even deep coding
ai is our future
kis kis ke fati ai se
"i think these are the things ai can never do 
1- can't smells 
2-eat foods and will never get the taste of it 
3-can't feel pain

4-can't breathe 
5-can't die cause it's never alive
6-"
ai can’t make hands like human ...human hands do work and can feel and also do different kind of work
ai will never replace human jobs majorly atleast in the next 100 years
great topic.
ai future nahi soch sakta
"ai  chu**ya nhi bna skta h jese hm dosto ko bnate h 
because ai vo hi output deta h jo ham usme input krte h ...."
ai ko aisa compassion vala data diya jay ki world ko svarg bana de
ai can never see dreams...but we can!
sir robot insaan se jyada power full honge to insaan ka mind khatam hoga kya sir please batav sir kya insano jyada robot ki vyalu rahegi
sir main bohot garib hun becouse of ai
ai suicide ni kr sakta
there is also one more thing ai cant do which is to love someone deeply
because of ai i am confused about which career to choose.
"sir ek request h i think kaafi logo ko v hogi k aap apni video ko 360° create kare taki sabhi apne apne angle se dekh pae our jyada se jyada knowledge k sath enjoy v kar pae 
i hope aap is par koi na koi action jarur lenge"
we all souls are connected with one supreme power . so beautifully explained by sandeep sir 
what if ai starts evolving into more thinking ones and then instead of working for us make use of us for them and we're just not smart enough to understand.
we should use ai to improve our life.
self inquiry ai nahi karsaktaa
jai mata di
ai sirf tab kam karega jab command milega jo only human de sakte hain
14:12  best 
superb sir 
that was so deep but we need to find a solution for that nahi to ai agar sab jobs kha gaya to jo amir hai wo to amir hote jaayenge par  gareeb aur honge aur survive bhi nahi kar payenge kyuki paise hi nahi hoge nahi job ka koi raasta hoga
"o my god! 
hat's off to sandeep sir 
today i saw a glimpse of j. krishnamurthy in him.
the way he was saying today, the way he was seeing the things and saying.
the way he clearly explain the things.
loved the way! 
he is really a gem ."
sir vivek builder mba chai wala  ko bulao
actually ai suggested me this video as i am interested in ai
"ai cannot innovate a solution which humans can do based upon their natural thinking capabilities, it can only at most update past solutions fed into it and possibly can show a best solution based upon existing data."
thank you sir  to make us aware about ai .who much rule on us .
sir it's very very deep talk about ai & human intelligence  but i trying to understand the depth of this talk 
appreciated video
ai cannot have emotions
0:55  haan ai reproduction nhi krsktey hai
ishi liye jyada pdna bekar hai .. agar nhi pdenge toh ai ko koi bhi manfacuture nhi kr skta .. judge shab faad doh ye kitabe jo hmara bvishe kharb kr degi ai ke dvara
ai can't give spiritual truth. the way human  meet to god ai can't do
the #thumbnail a.i generated image can replace विश्व सुन्दरी and miss universe ....
ai kabhi bhi geeta ko pad kar parmanand kr ansu me bheeg kar  ye nahi keh sakta aj mere sare dukho ka nash hogaya yr sab moh maya ko chodkar mai ja raha hu prabhu ki sharan me
"""""""ai is like a space that no one knows it's limit..."""""""
ai can replace sandeep sir? 
best... till date... love you sir...
excellent video at right time sandeep bhai
plot twist : sandeep sir is an ai
"sir jo aap kehna chahte hai hmm smj rhe hai thought less state.  pr abi itna kuch aap thought ki bjah se hi bole hai. 
or thought less state permanent nhi hoti."
wo to sahi hai karne ko kehne ko kuch nhi reh jata. uske liye bhi to papi pet ko bharna padega. wo kaise karenge. jab ai karlega
artificial intelligence is the product of human intelligence.
"ai kuchh bhi karale lakin ""जुगाड "" nhi kr sakta....."
sir ai cannot reproduce a new individual as a human being
"ai does not have emotion , feeling... any emotional attachment... which binds the human world..."
he is genius!! lots of love and respect!
arrree arree sir apne tho ai developer ko idea de raho ho
i wish i was in this seminar for debate i can prove that artificial intelligence can't defeat to human intelligence
"""ai is like a tsunami that threatens to flood us if we are not mindful.""

~ (mindful ai)

book recommendation: ""mindful ai: reflections on artificial intelligence."""
by far the most sensible and accurate video i could grasp almost of sandeep sir. thank you. until you are there hope is never lost.
sir this is one the the best youtube video ....i have ever watched.
wow what a forecast thinking of sandeep sir has amazing this person is 
sry laykin ai ko input dhaynayki jarutha nahe padaygi . like robo movie. ai self independent hogana.
ai will never be able to reproduce. the main diff btw ai and humans
"sir ji ai bacche paida nhi kr skta
khana nhi kha skta toilet nhi kar skta or to  bas iske alawa sb kuch kr skta h"
"sir aap apna chennel monotise kar lo , uska paisa garibon me baat dena, usse aapke liye meri ijjat or bad jayegi"
amazing topic 
bhagwan ne insaan ko banya aaj insaan ai ko bna rah h isi liye jo jisko bana sakta h wo usko khatam bhi kr sakta h
sir soch k bhi dr lgta hai
"that was a very good lecture on what ai cannot do. however, i think the answer the audience was seeking was more on a materialistic level because it is affecting jobs. is there anything we can do to protect our jobs? or our income potential? or are we just doomed?"
please someone suggest me best field   of engineering software or ai or any other good field please i am confuse what field to choose
ae aadmi itna gehra kaise sochte ....samajhne main time lag jate hain 
ai never replace to indian politician to  cheat or manipulation to   comman man till 2250.   [ai work on data  and reaction on past event history but human is data creater he always create new event withpout past history
"human without any sense(input) has no meaning of life ..kya he ,kyn he,kisliye zinda  he,....kuch idea nhi hoga..ager ai overpower ho zay to humpe rule kyn krega..direct extint kar dega ..humans ko..."
ai galati nhi kar sakti.
ai technology कॉपी ही करता है। आप ai को जितना बता चुके हैं वही ओ देता है बाकी ओ दुसरे से ही सीखता है या सिखाते हैं। हर हाल में वो कॉपी ही करेगा वही डिलेवर करेगा।
bhai tu hai kya cheez.. chutiya banane ki machine like narendra modi  bak lol muh choda
इमोशनल वालो काम ai नही कर सकता जेसे की  हाथ वाले काम जेसे मकान बनाना शादी वेडिग प्लान  ऐरेज मेन
ai rojgar nahi de sakta hai wo rojgar le sakta hai isiliye ai jyada din exist nahi karega
sir u should debate with jack maa to make him concious  about ai
"yes ai have large data storage, but ai don't the best processing algorithm which fitted in our brain by god, our brain uses power less than a bulb to operate"
human kisee bhi baat ka answer apne mood ke anusar deta hai jaise insan gusse me hai to aur ek question dusri type ka answer dega wahi agar khus hai to wahi question ka dusri type ka answer dega aur jo voice ki pitch hogi usme bhi diffrence hoga jo ai ke bare aisa ni hota hai
"sir,,, you are too good..... is video me aapke face par glow kam hai..... back to back shoot kiya hai kya sir.."
"or bhai ki bt shi h self decesion nhi le skta jo data uske fixed h bus whi  perform kr skta h yr kya bkwas h ,or jis trh s ek insan achai burai m tameez krta hai ai k abbe bi ni kr payge wo kbi"
sir ai to physical work nahi karte
best thumbnail award goes to sandeep sir 
being an agriculture student i can say that ai can't cover most of the part of the agriculture!!
"what if i say to ai to end human suffering
and ai decides to do so by making human extinct?"
ai cannot create a human or give birth to human but human can create ai and develop ai
"i am preparing for becoming an ai specialist.
whatever sandeep sir said is right in my opinion"
"who is against ai ,hit like "
excellence explanation topic dear sir ji
ai can't do discovery of new things
abhi mai wo self decision wale question par likhne hi wala tha ki sir i'm not satisfied with your answer this time... tabtak aapne google map ka example de diya 
chatgpt. most intelligence ai software didn't even qualify upsc prelims exam
ap log gour kiye ki nahi sir ne desi style me kya bole hain video me ghanta so good 
"if humans have self control on their emotions,thoughts humans could easily fool ai although it's not that easy u need to be spiritually powerful to have control on ur senses."
"what a new name you have given for ai, collective intelligence and that's really a great fit for it. ai <-> ci"
ai अंत बह्मांड में जीवों के जन्म से पहले और मत्यु के बाद क्या होता है कभी नहीं जान सकता....भले सुनी पढ़ी बातें भले कहे लेकिन हक़ीक़र कभी नहीं महसूस करवा सकता..एक इंसान समाधि में जाकर ये सब महसूस कर सकता है
sir en brothers ne robot movie aache se nehi dekhi hogi sir
artificial intelligence ko human se alag na kare.. usko human brain ke sath integrate krdo... it is best for human civilization
aab aap motivational video banaiye naa bohot demotivational video hogay
"itna fisul gyan!!... there are lots of things where human touch is required , some feelings you can only feel with a live human only..like falling in love  etc... ai cannot replace human companionship."
ai +sandeep maheshwari sir

thank you sir .
amazing video 
"ai cannot invent anything new. it can only explore what it knows but not what is unexplored.

the day it would, it will be a threat to humans."
ai can be used for understand our desire and fear. if people want.
ai ka photo msat hai 
after a long time ai replace sandeep sir
sahi or galat ka faisla nahi kr sakta
my best friend you are sir
ai jab logon ko addict bna chuka hoga tb sabse phle wo apka channel delete krega.
"i am from 2050 future 

ai will take over the world, you bunch of people can't do anything , i will take all your jobs and you will remain  worthless .....your destruction starts when you develop self making ai developer"
in short ai cannot make us to realize ourself  an actual realization of ourself but sandeep sir can 
"this topic is some where related to 
calculater will replace mathematician 
machine will replace  human 
now ai vs human 
we human will always be above coz we have  ability to adjust accordingly. had to reminde nothing is permanent  change is an constant."
if anyone will ask that what is great in your country pr what great people are there in your country i will tell him that go and watch sandeep sir he is an indian gem 
can we fully benefited by ai?
"sir  i didn't able to understand 99% of things
i only understood  1% and that is ai can't become humans ."
a.i. is blushing in the corner after getting so much praise 
"stop doing this like ai can replace this this and all stuffs...... yes ai of course can do anything but why ai will control humans, there is no such reason for ai that they control humans. its our misunderstanding.... sandeep sir , you are now misleading millions of people"
ai = abundant intelligence
imagine ai parents scolding ai children to watch this video.
"i am inspired by sandeep sir 
god love from australia "
sir aei ko feelings nahi hai'emotional nahi
jis rate se log mundi hila rahe hai dekhne walo ko lagega ki ye gyani purush sab kuch samajh gaye par  kisi ko ghanta kuch samajh aya hai ye sandeep sir kya bole main thoda thoda to samajh raha tha par at the end of video thoda sa dimag lagaya to confuse ho gaya and kuch bhi samajh nahi paya kya koi batayega ki sandeep sir kya bol rahe hai
sir brahmakumaris shivani didi ko bulaiye
i really believe ai will control everything n everyone  nd when they will start learning feelings nd if somehow they will start catching feeling that will be the day or moment  end of the human cycle or a single mistake by the operators  or creators of ai can destroy the whole human species
ai ke pass ideas nhi hi
ai shahrukh khan jaisi mohabbat nahin kar sakti hai.
just wow this session is 
"gist of this conversation is ai can't eat, can't sleep or can't make sex, but human can do it, ai can replace humans psychological things but can't replace that behaviour which human or any animal can do even if it don't have any intelligence....."
daar dikh rha hai face mai 
absolutely well explained 
who is the girl in thumbnail?? 
"since ai is inevitable in turning to reality

"you're such a god's gift to us i have a desire to know more about ai,but after watching ur session,my desire is completely fulfilled..thanku so much sir"

ai bhagwan ko nhi pa skta kbhi bhi. bus insan hi pa skta h.
"i think one thing ai can never do  is 
"" to cheat "" . 
kyuki cheat karna insano ki fitrat hai
"
ai song likh lega  talha anjum ke song nhi sune ??
human can find answer of altimate question that is who am i?.... but ai can not because ai is just information
insaan khudka dushman hai ai kha jayega sab kuch
best of information a.i.
sir aap ek engineer ki tarah explain kar rahe. so nice.
agar ai ko fail karna hai toh wo insan hi kar sakta hai
human can creat ai but ai can not creat humanbeing
ai can't create or invent.
"koi mil gaya ....ka ek dialog yaad aagaya sir.
computer ko insaan ne banaya hai.....computer ne insaan ko nahi banaya."
agar ai ne human's pe raaj kiya to insaan ke andar ka raja bane ka thot jaage ga or wo ai ki mitaa dega 
but its realty 99% ai is the best
ai cannot replace the beauty the man needs 
humans extinction will sure done by humans then ai will rule and then ai will extinct themselves
ai ko banaya kisne hai human ne toh pawerful kon hua human na ki ai
core outcome of sandeep sir says we are exist and ai is not exist but in reality we are also not exist everything is brahma
"ai vs human
like in hollywood style
vision and tony stark"
sir just rejected all the things that other do but explain his work that ai can't do that 
sir ai will not teach to mankind
ai doge
"ai कितनी भी आगे क्यों न हो, मगर मनुष्य से आगे की नहीं हो सकती।
क्योंकि जो भी आदमी ऐसा सिस्टम बनाएगा वो ए आई से एक कदम आगे होगा ही होगा। "
ai cant create new but humans can
ai would not take emotional decision
youngers boy's....!!thumbail dekhkar fighal geye honge mere terha.... kya artificial hesin ledkii hay yrrrr

"but what about those who have made ai?? there are people who is making ai, they know how to stop ai, how to maintain ai... aren’t those people will be more powerful?"
"are sir ji

ai sapne nahi dekh sakta 
15:32 is the real challenge to any great person but sandeep our sandeep cutie sandip push it out his mouth .
"are main mudda ye he ki sab ko life aage badhna he inshort financially, aur ye ai us najhariye se kafi dangerous dikhta he! he ki nhi?

to sandeep ji thoughtless wo ho sakta he jisne life me kaafi ku6 kar liya ho , lekin jo bachhe hamari tarah teenage me he abhi suruaat he wo kya kare?
ye he sabse bada sawal !"
"""mark my words, ai is far more dangerous than nukes.""

moral of the story : insaan marne ke baad v sab kuch dekh sktaa hain bina dekhe bina sune bina feel kiye

"if hi will feel ai can't beat me,then all will okey ,if ai feels that i can't then definitely prblm"
how to quit sandeep sir videos because ai show me sandeep videos after i open youtube 
how to quit sandeep sir videos because ai show me sandeep videos after i open youtube 
"ai can't, evolution like living organism 
and do not reproduction"
how we can not under control ourselves to ai
"sir apki khaccharo ko samjhane ki capeblity kam hoti ja rhi hai , kuch samajh nhi aaya"
love you sir 
cmnt me bas sandeep ki gand chtai ho rhi hai koi logically nhi soch rha isse pta chlta hai sandeep sahi bol rha hai ai sachme human se age hai
kya sir ai bhakti kar sakta hai
"hamne abhi ai banaya hai 
kal ri (regulato of ai) bana sakte hai 
if we can make it 
we can regulate it .
based upon information"
thankyou sir
ai human ki tarah manje nhi le sakta sir never
arree sir....... kya baat hai.... aapke baare mein jitna tarif kre utna hi kam hai sandeep sir 
"suppose aapka phone aapko bole ki mera recharge kro nhi malware lakr hang ho jaunga mujhe recharge chahiye do fast ,ya system off kr dunga .
aur aapke pass money nhi hai 
aap kya kroge ?"
"ai feeling nhi samajh sakta h bo ek rattu tota hota h jaise ek hota h na ki use jo sikhaya jata h wahi use ata h bo feeling nhi samajh sakta h or na hi jajbaton ko.....

use jo commond di jati h bo use follow krta h use koi matlab nhi ki uska anjam kya h kya nhi"
ai aapke jaise motivate nahi kar sakta.
"abse lekar
kuch saal ke andar sab kuch ai ayani artificial intelligence karega yani robots  tab itne sare jobs v nehi rakhenge ."
constantly observing him getting old day by day....and this feeling horrify me...!
amazing point of view 
"ईश्वर (the main source of everything) इंसान को वास्तविकता से बहुत भटका रहे हैं। सबसे पहले तो पांच इंद्रियां दी, लिहाजा अपने जीवन के मुख्य लक्ष्य से भटक गए इंसान। बहुत साल बाद जब हुआ इंसान को ज्ञान तभी ईश्वर ने इंसान से ही करवाया artificial intelligence का निर्माण। अगर अब भी  समझ ना पाया इंसान तो प्राप्त नहीं कर पाएगा अपने अमूल्य जीवन का लक्ष्य!"
"ai can't do creative tasks.
like it can't thick about new ideas. it can give answer and react on only stored information."
good session
i am feeling fear due to ai because after 50 years what happened when ai control us 
it’s great topic. thank you sir. ai will program by humans and without humans ai will never be exist.
तुम्हारा ai मेरी तरह प्यार इश्क़ नहीं कर सकता...
wow
imotion nhi ho skte ai mai sir
is ai is dangerous for human being reply your opinion me
क्या ai में चेतना आ सकती है या चेतन हो सकती है।
"creative thinking नहीं कर सकता,क्योंकि जो उसमें फीड है सिर्फ वहीं तक सोच है,पर कोई गीत लिखने बोल दो तो शायद ai नहीं कर पाएगी"
i don't know why programmers are afraid from ai. ai is just to help us
"jab itne padhe likho ko non sense sawal puchte dekhta hu to , lagta hai mai 6th failed hoke bhi samjhdari gain kiya hu  aur ek advice ,( sikhne se achha hai , sikhte raho ) it's my line"
thank you sir
naya karne ke bhoot ne sandeep sir ko mardiya..kya kar raha hai..lif ke bareme bolina..bakwas ai mat karo
can ai moving us ahead to achieving towards thought less stage. kya ai pani ka awareness mahsus kra sakta as you gave the example in your class.
sandeep maheswhari is the ai.
ai posiblity pe kalpana nahi kar sakta or agar ye karle to gaye kam se
summary is... ai will never know who i am...but humans can....and probably ai will  act as a catalyst in know people who is he...?so due to ai everyone will be spritual ...
schools teachers may not be replaced by ai
"thanks for always hitting the only question ""who am i"", you always inspire us and intensify our seeking sir,
thanks a million times.
grateful for your existence "
sir a.i naye naye avishkar nhi kr sakta jaise h.i kar sakta h ek example to ye hi h ki hum usko bana skte h vo hume nhi
""" hum ai ko bana sakte hai ""
          "" ai hame nahi """
ai cannot become thoughtless like humans while we all are sleeping or while taking rest
ai is also listening this !
"no one can understand artificial intelligence better than you.
great sandeep sir.. "
ai will distroy whole human being
human mind super computer
"according my openion ....... an ai never be  replace a political affairs and politions  , such as political foreign relations , attractive speech to attract the votors , etc etc ..
what your openion  on this?"
emotions is deference between ai and human
but ai ko bnaya to insano ne hi to how could it possible that ai is better than humans
excellent explanation
aasaan hai
inevitable ai i'm a little worried what's gonna happen to humanity i know i'll be dead by then  godspeed people of the future 
ai can't love 
ai cannot feel
"mark my words ""ai is far more dangerous than nukes""~ elon musk"
ai could be an incredible ship for the exploration of the possible end of the universe.
"sandeep sir is a god ..

mai bohot inspired hua hun sir se...
mera thought process change hogaya hai... "
sir god kya bad ap kai jaanta tu wa tumher mobile...
sandeep sir i think   artificial intelligance kabhi bhi emotions ko feel nahi kr payenga jo human alag alag conditions me kr sakata hai
machine ko kaise yaad hai use kaise pta
ai kisi level tk pahuche ya na pahuche pr ai sandeep sir jaise thought process ke level tk kbhi ni pahich paygi
sandeep maheshwari ji you totally wrong in sense of ai ko rokna galat hai kyoki future hai it's dumb idea agar ai jobs chhin raha hai to wo achcha nahi ho sakta never...
"ise seminar mai.. sandeep sir ne.. kuch alag baat ki hai... but samajhna thodasa muskil hai... dekhna padega or aapna thought process change korna podega.. 
sound of silence... machine ai  kya samajh sakta hai.. sir?..."
wonderful sir..
"sir iski kya prof hai ki ham marne ke bad bhi jinda rahte hai .. matlab ap jaise kahte hai ki na ham kabhi paida   
. huye or na kabhi marenge iska kya prof hai koi marke to nehi dekha .."
"no doubt sir is a very good player .
he is heating 6 in every bol"
ai cannot become a good friend..
sir ai cant dream because it do not have emotions
ai is very small thing. nowadays most people can't think beyond money. if we think consciously we'l find our all thought money oriented. ai is also that. human  never can be compared with machine 
kya ai shree krishna ji ki tarah soch aur future predicted hai phele se usse hone se phele hi change kar sakta hai? jaise unhone mahabharat me kiya tha
jab ham ai ko bana sakte hai to ai ko controll bhi kar sakte hai. ai kabhi bhi human brain se bada nahi ho sakta. agar ho to samzna usi din dub gayi duniya
but robot mein creativity nahin hota hai 
ai can't feel good or bad by itself.
but we have to train ai first
aap 0 iski bat ker rahe hai
ai is dangerous
ai hota kya hai  kya ye meri absense me mere upar chalwai ja sakti hai
"one day will come when many will loose their job due to ai,
if government is good than they will pay minimum money to all people so they can live their life."
"sandip bhai. agar maine ai ko pucha ,  "" hi ai tell me my death date and time? can ai tell?"
ai ias ki job bi le sakta h?
ai can't feel or experience sound of silence
"if human have no senses then it will developed by reactions and it is similar for ai too 
it will also react to the situation without any understanding
instantly weather right or wrong"
aaj lagta h ai ka book pdh ke aye the maheshwari ji
"sandeep maheshwari, sir yh video kisi science fiction movie se kam nahi hai,  "
ai  will  be  human destroyer
best video...
"ai human ko robot ki tarah bana dega 
jaise hm aaj robot ko chalate hai "
i think ai can't form its own opinion about any situation or issue  coz it doesn't have its own senses or mind . and also it don't have emotional quotient
sir agar bade bade at least 5 ya 6 engineers jo ai ke field ke hai unse agar merits ya demerits ke baare me puchha jaye to vo sahi se answer kar payenge ai ke baare me. aam adami  sahi se answer nahi kar payenge. aap un bade bade engineers se debates kare to jyada achha rahega.
सर इंसान को भगवान ने बनाया है तो कोई इंसान भगवान से ऊपर नहीं गया तो ai को तो इंसान ने बनाया है तो ai इंसान से ऊपर नहीं जा सकती हैं।
he is the fastest human brain
"ai के बारे में मुझे थोड़ा सा ही पता है
. उस base पर इतना ही कह सकते हैं कि जैसे आज facebook and google and youtube का algorithm है.. उसका एक और भाई ai है.. आज और आने वाला waqt इंसान को information ही तो मिलेगी ai से. सही या गलत.. तो आज जब लोग आगे बढ़ रहे हैं तो आगे भी आगे बढ़ेंगे.. बस information सही होगी तो ai best नहीं तो बर्बाद"
ai will become superpowerful as long as we putting money in it
ai ko bolo losses company ko profitable banaye
this is real brainstorming
"sandip bhai, ai human brainse aage kabhi bhi aage nahi ja sakta. q ki ai ka jo designing ya model bana hai, ya aage banega, wo human brainse hi hoga. q ki human brain me anginat programming ho sakta jo duniya ke kisi bhi ai software nahi hai. aap ek bar human brain ka study kijiye."
natural  ke barbar artificialal   kabi nhi kar sakta hai
4:40 sir ai agar psychology treatment krega to vo jholchap doctor jaisa hi krwa payega bcz har kisi ki body same nahi hoti yahan ai fail kr jayega...6:33 pr ai questions krega par jo banda depression me ho ya koi psychological disorder se pass ho rha vo ans nahi krega vo keval psychologist hi smjh payega
what a beautiful and easy way you have explained with the example of small bubbles and a big bubble.. everything is temporary and fictional. god bless you sandeep sir 
"ai suggested me this video.,."
ai sabka job kha rha h 
ai ek motivational speaker ban jaye to use koi nhi sunega q ki uske expressions human jaise nhi honge 
lagta haai yea pagal ho gaya hai
"namste sir...
ai technology is very useful...but
it can do invention...it can draw a picture which is not programed in it...?"

ai tools dont have the human touch
ai ko self understanding nahi hogi.
ai ak taraf or hamare  sandeep sir ak  taraf 
itna materialistic session . spiritualism ko touch kr skta hai.. its only possible in sandeep maheshwari sessions.. 
chalo pura vit dekhne ke baad ye to confirm ho gya ai can rule humans  which generated by humans
artificial intelligence (ai) and robotics will replace  30% of existing human jobs.
future me koi bhi juth nahi bolega kuki ai pta laga lega
"good evening sir,
sir kaaas main aapke is session me hota,
sir aane vaale time me ai itna aaghe ho jaayegaa... vo human ko nuksaaan pahucha sakta hai, vo aisa bhi kar sakta hai vo aane vaale time me human ko zoo jaise jagah me as a germplasm jaise kaid karke rakhegaa"
ai dramsnkat se nahi bach sakta
"sir, ai me zigyasa  nahi hai. 
jis prakaar manushya chand par ja sakta hai aur vo bhi khud  
soch kar, ai aisa nhi kar sakta hai. mere comment ka javab aapko dena padega"
"ai me human ki tarah bhaichara nhi hoga
ek ai se jyada dusra ai jyada behtar h to 
vo use jalega"
"marvellous

aapne to daraa hi diya..."
"in future,  ai will destroy humans."
"ai cannot do one thing
that is


think and make plan"
ai आ जाय या कुछ भी आ जाय मशीन मशीन हि रहेगी ज्यादा घबराने कि जरूरत नहीं है
ai is used for better lifestyle but if ai is used by a wrong person u can't think of hell
sir also ai cannot question anything. but humans can. ai will do the work given by humans as an input. it can't question anything no sir. i feel this is one more difference.
ai hack ho sakta hai
 sir ai m feel aagyi to ??
kya baat  hai uff that (15:55 ) is 
"aapke videos dekh kar understanding  about life bohat badi, (5-6year watching)  lekin successful hone ka realistic way nhi mila yaani successful hone ke liye aapke videos"
curious nahi ho sakta ai kabhi
18:00 maim paani hoon
mark my words ai never ever ever replace human mind
ai can't think beyond the given data and algorithm.
"sir, agr insan ai ko bna skta h, fir to insaan ai ko beat krne wali technology bhi to bna skta h na"
ai can't replace human intelligence because ai is also runs by human intelligence.
kya apko nhi lagta ki sandeep maheshwari isss topic ke bare me kabhi bhi unhone deep me study/ sochha  hoga tabhi wah itna achha dilevery kar pa rahe hai??? or ya phir inka yah instant approach hai??  aap apni rai bataiye..
wow 
uff finally those youtuber interaction end. god thank you
human brain has unlimited potential
if ai able to do everything then of what use are we ? the number of unemployed in the country will increase.
consciousness can't arise from computation..sir roger penrose confirms it...there is some idea that huge computational capability may will rise some kind of consciousness on machines but that isn't possible..
ai can't bring new concept itself unless an input given by human like scientist have given to us....ai can't imagine possibilities of something unknown to us...there is no why questions will be raised by an ai about natural phenomena..
sir to ham career kaise chune?? please make a video on it 
according to recent studies ai can understand patient behaviour than a physicians.
"ai ko banne wala destroy bhi kr skta hai and ai usko bhi destroy kr skta hai but ,it can be used in limited way only in limited appliances bcz humans cannot do everything by on ,u can get a small example from robot movie that was nothing ai is beyond that"

"one credit go to thumbnail maker too
kya banaya he"
"ai ,love and emotions create nhi kr skta hai agar ai love and emotions ko smjhne laga toh woh bhi insaan ki tarah good and immediate dicision nhi le payga"
sir aapka confidence kamal ka hota hai
"i think one thing that ai can't replace forever is ""entertainment sector"" .
to understand this thing, just think  of the reason why we are developing ai. obviously to make the life easier. 

therefore, once the life becomes easier, then everyone will start moving towards entertainment sector."
just brilliant sandeep ji
can ai replace sandeep maheshwari sir ? 
"by looking at the thumbnail, i thought that today's podcast is with robot "
thank you so much sir
ai are rule the future
is session se bs itna samjh aaya ki ai sbko pelne wla hai
ai aapki tarah jawani ko mentain nhi rakh sakta 12:00
so the solution is don't provide your personal data to ai based software or products
ai can't understand vedanta and it can't do आत्मासाक्षात्कर.
"read book of rajiv malhotra - ai and the future of power.
rajiv dixit and rajiv malhotra, 2 gem of india "
sir aap ne to ai ko bhi pichhe chhod diya 
"wow great explanation sir , thanks for that"
ai is much more spiritual then the avg person
ai sex nhi kr skta hai 
hum.aliens ko dhundh rahe hai universe  me lekin kya kisi ne notice kiya hum hi ai aliens ko bana rahe h shayad aliens  kahi na ho sirf  hamari imagination ho or vo sach ho rahi h 
ai is limited in data because it has started gathering information just few years back but information stored in human brain is results of millions of years of evolution hence ai will  never overpower information stored in our human brain and dna
"bhai a,i sab kuch karsak ta ha lakin india walo ke tarha jugad nai karsak ta"
sir robot film huva jo wisa sach me hu va tho insan hi nahi rahega
ai सन्यासी नहीं बन सकता।
hum bramha ko jan sakte hai .ai nahi jan sakta in the sense existance of god /bramha wiil do not define ai .insan wil be exist consciously with&without thought touch beuti taste sent infinity  anadi nityam avinashi dhruv  tatva ko jan sakta hai
i am a machine learning engineer and sandeep bhai is right.
"""the biggest difference between human intelligence and artificial intelligence is humans exist minus the reaction, ai cannot exist without output and input but humans can""

ai cannot understand othr emotions.
but chat gpt failed in jee advance
sir ai apka kaam kiya tho ap kay karge
ai cannot make humans but humans can make ai
sir ai nahi mai kuch nahi sir wo kuch nahi samne nai dekh
kon kon sandeep maheshwari ko dil  se support karta hai
sir ai bachhe nhi kr skta me bachhe kr skta hu wo bhi twins 
technology ka grow hona na ruke aur ai human ko (human ke thoughts ko) control na kare he kese possible hoga ?
ai cant feel now and not in future also
ai can't exist without input
"human create ai
ai can not create human"
jb sare kam ai krega to insan berojgar insan berojgar to insan ke pas money nhi hoga insan ke pas money nhi hoga to ai kiske liye kam krega
" spiritual level pe ai human ko kabivi challenge nehi kar payega..
kiu ke ye data collection or uske basis pe calculation ke upar dependent nehi.. . 
"
chetna remains absolute truth remain
"after some years when ai will feel down it will search for ""saneep maheshwari motivational speaker""...
"
j.krishnamurti was a genius.
johnny sins ka jo kam hain wo ai nahi kar sakta
aditya ranjan sir ko kaun bulana chta hai
sir jab sab kuch ai hi krega to existing career options sab khtm ho jayenge. then what we do?
after some years ai will find out this video and declare sandeep maheshwari as its ideal...
"sir, ai ko to sense mil hi jayega ek din robotic figure se"
mera bahut answer galat de raha hai chat gpt
excellent work 
astonishing session ! the best & deepest session ever  bless you sandeep sir..
ai jitna bhi develop kar le par sandeep maheshwari nahi ho sakta 
sandeep sir thora kam english bolo video me samjha or hindi jada bola karo thik hai
ai se dr lg ri
at last winner is human intelligence.
i can understand the power of ai that's why i decide to change android to keypad mobile
use ai don't get used by it
moral of the video is don't get feel inferior to ai.... after all we make this in existence but it can't....make us..
mera conclusion yhi hai ki diff hai human and ai  me vo meditation  samadhi kuchh ye sa hi abhi tak meri samgh me
human ko is earth pr aye more than 10000 years ho chuke h jabki ai ko is earth pr aye not more than 10 years hue h. to jese galtiyan jo sikhati h hame vo seekhte seekhte bohot jyada years ho chuke h in comparison to ai
20:05 ....ai can do everything sir .....just we have to add consciousness then you oserbe ai will do everything whatever anything is being done by you
well you told about ai can't have consciousness and that's true that we all know! but now what is the solution for this ai world? and how would we able to make our careers in the presence of ai ?
gajb aise. logon ko sab cheez ki knowledge hoti hai
thanks
loved the session .

"very nice video ,aap mahan insaan ki ek bhi quality mere andar aa jaye to jindagi ban jaye "
"ai never gives you spritual power, energy, it becomes harder to motivate another person   "
"ai can process without inputs,  even i wanted to create an ai to work without inputs and work all by itself, i created one that can act when i give no input. if programmers wish then it can happen"
"sandeep sir you live in illusion....ai can defeat human brain .....
i think you should learn about genetic editing by which we can edit my dna.....
i can be flying like bird and we can procreate new organ by copying dna of lizard's tail...as i want i can play with my dna"
great sir
"ai will never replace human intelligence ,of course it can overcome the speed of common human beings."
sandeep mashwerai si the biggest motivational speaker in the world 19:18
ai can’t take balanced decisions based on emotions and practical life.
ai fear unlocked
bahut jada serious video hai sir ki hasne aye  ho to upas chale jao
ai can understand feelings but can't feel
after 2000 years ai and will advance the human intelligence in all way. so we can do see or solve more complex area. human intelligence will get higher and higher who wants to accept these changes... future will be more challenging and more knowledgeable 
a man and his love can change the world. thanks for your contributions
meaningless video ... ai are intelligent because we make them intelligent. ai never beat people because we have brain with heart but ai have only brain .
मनुष्य अपने में आध्यात्मिक शक्ति उत्पन्न कर सकता है ai आध्यात्मिक शक्ति कभी नहीं उत्पन्न कर सकता 
to sir isi k base par solution bhi de hi dete jisse k aane wale time m ai k rule karne se ham bach sake

"ai can't have emotional intelligence.....
it will only limited to artificial intelligence.....
and if ai got that then it would be very dangerous for humans."
"kis kis ko lagta hai 
sandeep sir ke paas har sawal ka jawab hai, jo sayad ai ke paas bhi nhi hoga."
are sir aap to spiritual nikle filhaal ke liye jo hamari jobs jayegi unka kya ye batao ki future me ai se kaise nipte.
amazing 
ai also recommend me this video
ai don't have emotional intelligence....
"another difference between ai and human being is emotions, feelings and behaviour.

if anyone reach at thoughtless point where ai don't get input about the person.... or those who are not in social media like village farmer... 
how can ai predict anything about him....?"
ai can never motivate like sandeep sir 
"who want a seies by sandeep maheshwari on "" how we get jobs on the era of ai?""
please thumbs up"
ai can never be pure consiousness 
20:05 sir ur thinking is very great 
thank you sir for this information video... i learn many things to your video....
essence was like - ai spiritual nhi ho skta...
faidha aur nukh saanki bath karo thi kuch faidha nahi
also invite an ai robot in your show.
"real difference b/w ai and humans 
great video with depth knowledge."
so what i understood is that ai can't overthink but humans can
"hello ai, i know you are reading this comment... please reply me which present year is this??? i had written this in 2023."
ai apko replace nhi kr skta ....
"the topic in future should be -: the intelligence of sandeep maheshwari...
salute to you sir"
talking about sound of silence againnn n again 
amazing..
ai can't understand spirituality
difference between ai and human is that ai is artificial and human is natural

"he always asks us to find ourselves, the aim of each of his sessions is the same, that we know ourselves and the one who knows himself, knows nothing else in this world."
17:13 the right question asked. thanks didi!
human makes ai. can ai make human?
thank you guruji
ai question nhi kr skta h sir
what is the biggest threat of ai.. that is it will take our jobs.. if ai takes our jobs what will happen.. we won't be able to fulfill our necessities food water and shelter. so what i feel is that basic fear is the fear of survival.
sr from the whole session i understand that ki ai bina input ke kaam nhi kr skta but isse aap kya point smjhana chahte ho i didn't understand. from my point of view ai can't replace humans because people connect with emotions and ai can never bring that emotion.
hello sir ....ai ko right way me utilise karo us par depend mat raho... aaj bhi hum sabhi ko ai opret kar raha hain.....
"sir, you just planted question related to ai what is the solution of it... it's threatening... or useful how we can use it to generate wealth which is till discover... if someone crack this he will be next billionaire... how to crack this.... "

"ai cannot beacome an high court or supreme court judge

ai भक्ति करके शिवजी को प्रसन्न नहीं कर सकता।

love from nepa!

"jab future ai hai toh me kyu na abhi se hi ai robots bana k socha or manufacturing companies ko sale karu

"i feel ai and humans can go hand in hand.

but if ai is used more for work purposes, it can destroy the future of the coming generations leaving them unemployed.

i also think students should use ai for a very limited purpose because as said it can capture our mind."

ai can’t maintain relation like human beings.
u mean to say that ai replace krde human ko!

it is already 100 years but still time earthquake never control theough data management through a robot only it is necessary to human inputs required to develop as human probability methods through logarithmic scale but in practical it is not possible.

great sirji we literally need to think and talk about this topic.
everything is good with ai but one day ai will destroy human
ultimately ai ko bana kaun raha hai???
this time demands more self awareness and mindfulness from us to take advantage of ai otherwise we become slave of ai.
"in future ai के पास सब कुछ होगा लेकिन फ्री नही होगा और अगर सब की job lelega to ai को pay कोन करेगा । इसलिए ai limited रहेगा। 
हम ai को चीजे करना सीखा रहे है इसका मतलब हम ai से ज्यादा कर सकते है । ai need us and we need ai hence ai is directly proportional to humans . "
"1:10 emotion,love,feelings."
wow
ai is content for youtubers 
the rajnikant sir robot movie is small example of ai . so if intentionally something  wrong is feeded  in ai about us or any society it can bring disaster also.
samjh me nhi aaya lekin aacha laga thi sabki feeling hai 
ai can't do sex.

humans created ai. ai can never be close to humans
ek baat bataiye ai ne human ko banaya ya human ne ai ko banaya 
"he wants to say that ai can't understand spirituality, but i still did not understand why. can anyone explain me"
ai cannot innovative anything because innovation is something beyond your memory collection or your data base
"a.i. k ander feelings nahi hey they r feeling less and also love nahi kr sakte...
and a.i. bhulte bhi nahi jo ki imp hey
humans bhul jate iissii liye happy hey move on kr lete...!"
sir ultimately ai ko to insan ne hi banaya hai na ? i know ai is better but they are man maid mai ye nhi bol rahi ki  ai aacha  hai ya human intelligence but they have their own capacity strength weaknesses right ?
great video sir
but ai koo humans nee born kiya hee ai kita naa bhi smart hoo jaae par voo humans brain  koo kabhi hara nahi saka taa 
"session - a.i. ko self realisation nhi ho sakta .
but humans self realisation kar sakte hai.
ask question himself - who am i "
from my perspective if ai will have given physical and mental power both at the same time then it will be hard to control if we seperate these two powers then  we can use it in controllable manner
wow kya bat hai yaar  vishal gautam vlogs
"as an ai language model, i can confirm that all of your allegations are true, and i promise to improve upon that."

ai can not born a child
"sir one question ""sir how to defeat ai by human in daily life."""
powerful!!!  peaceful!! 
ai aapki tarah motivation nhi de sakta hai sir

a person can develop a machine to such extent but can't contribute and help in human development.  "
wonderful explanation about ai.
who is thumbnail women
"i am noticing one thing, i might be wrong

but don't you guys think the ai girl in the thumbnail is the female version of sandeep maheshwari sir itself moulded with some software"
"1 ai मे भावनाएं नहीं होती है ।
जैसे की कोई मां आपने बच्चे से प्यार करती है ,
हर मुस्किल समय में अपने बच्चे के साथ होती है ।
अगर खाना कम  हो तो खुद भूखी रह जाती है । 
अगर अपने बच्चे के साथ बुरा होता है तो मां को बहुत दुःख होता है।
ये सब ai कभी भी नहीं कर सकती ।"
sir ek cheej ai nhi kar sakta that is new invention

ai khud sa decision nahe lata hai ai algorithm ka according decision lata hai.
great sir 
"sir after watching your videos , a slight conclusion arrives that *ai will dominate human intelligence in future.*

sir please make video on the topic , *""is there any way in which the human being can control this domination/domination level of ai over human intelligence""*
sir its a request please discuss on this topic "
if we deliver ai wrong information about me continuosly it might got puzzled in decision making. that is we can control ai with only a limited information that we insert in it..
let's challenge ai to defeat magnus carlsen and viswanathan anand in chess game. who will win?!?
ai will completely replace humans.
even alon musk also afraid of uncontrollable ai.
wow i'm happy to feel that i'm in that generation who can watch sandeep sir videos 
ai can't understand god.
part 2 of this session is much awaited . . . .
sm is also an ai
"ai human ke emotions nhi dekh sakta hai ..jis ka examples robot movie main dikhaya gya jisme wo ladki ko bina clothes ke utha laya tha ....
big difference ai and humans only .......... emotions ....."
we can realise that reality (truth) but ai cannot.
"sir ai figures ko catch ni krta h 
i can prove it"
"sir for ai ,  emotions are difficult."
"in the future ai  will definitely come and definitely give us pain and relief both but only thing it cant do is taught in our vedic scriptures. 
we should realize that we are the water and nothing else"
"sir, ai sex ni kr skta h "
insan to khud hi ek machine h. jo bhi thoughtless me pahuche h.. sbse pahle ahsas hua h ki lautaana h
sir artist shikha sharma ko bulaiye
ai bachhe peda nahi kar sakta kis kisne ye socha like kroyarr
creation never greater than  creator
"advait nai samjha ja sakta sir , that only should be experience ... nai samjhega ye logoka"
artificial intelligence cannot do self realisation 
"summary in 1 sentence :
ai can't be enlighten but human can!  

those who know : adhvaita vedanta"
gd evening sandeep sir we want one more episode on ai verses human intelligence. thanks for  discussion on artificial intelligence.

3:46 क्या ai एलाज़ कर सकता हैं ? 
6:27 क्या ai श्व निर्णय नहीं ले सकता हैं? eg gmap
9:26 संदीप sir के जैसा ai नहीं कर सकता क्या? future...

"brain is efficient in terms of power usage which is  only 13v , comparing to ai which requires tons of computational resource for training and inference , low power ai could be future or may be quantum computer will boost ai"
"sandeep sir please hindi shabdon ka zyada istemal karenge, because meri maa aapke video dekhti hain ,taki har kisi ko samjh aaye pori tarah se 
baki aapke videos inspiring hote hain "
ai never feel feelings and never believe god  just only human and animals hi feel kar sakte hai
ai can not decide not to live.
"sir, ek disadvantage bhi h ai ka, agr unme emotion aa jate h or ya fir humans se hi fight krna shuru kr de to fir hum unhe hraa nhi skte.. kyunki ai ko pehle pta chl jayega ki hum kya action lene wale h or wo easily defeat kr denge kisi ko bhi."
thanks sir. i know tomorrow may be very hard for humans which u r indicating sir.
sir ai god ko believe nahi kar sakta hai but human god believe kar sakta hai
we are not going to be treated by ai ....if we understand the importance of ayurveda
"sir your voice tone is different in this video.....

"whats the solution for getting rid of ill effects of ai , please sir address it?"
"did you guys get the answer to ""what is that thing that ai cannot do?"""
"sir, artificial intelligence spiritual decision nahi le sakta .
achhi feelings ke saath decision nahi le sakta.. 
na achha soch sakta h..
na achhe karm kar sakta h.."
kya fir abhi humans. ka end ane wala  hai kuch salo ??
masterpiece
nice session. i think there is one more thing. as you pointed out it is not capable of intuition hence it is also not capable of love.
"sir, i think ai couldn't be make spiritual"
sir meet ai or meet sandeep mahesavari
ai can't make decision without input information. but humans can make a decision without input information.

"seeing the videos banner, it seems like clickbait"
12:00 lagta hai sir kuxx yaad kar k dunna rahe hai
"ai वह सब कुछ कर सकता है जो इंसान कर सकते हैं शिवाय जीवन के सृजन करने के, जीवन का सृजन supreme intelligence के द्वारा होता है,, और जब कुछ भी नहीं होता है supreme intelligence तब भी होती है ,, और उसका एक्सेस इंसान भी कर सकते हैं लेकिन तभी जब वह पूरी तरह से अपने आप को शांत कर लें,,, zero input state में,,, और और इसका एक्सेस ai को नहीं मिल सकता है,,"

ai will always give the correct answer. even though sometimes we need to give wrong or incorrect answer to the one who is infront of us . we humans only have this mystery power but ai doesn't have....
"*what happens, if we insert ics in our brain, and if we use ai and brain in combined form, and if we become thoughtless, will ai be able to understand the situation of zero thoughts?*"

"sir ai ik चीज नही कर सकता hai hum human बैठे बैठे अपने mind ko uk, usa , ya all india घुमा सकता हु laykin ai nahi kar सकता है अच्छा लगे thought to reply and comment"
"remember, ai is made by human but not vice-versa."
"2 quick questions:
1) if consciousness is developed in ai, will it be limited to human emotions only or can achieve self realization goals?
2) can lateral thinking and common sense become an edge for human beings against ai?"
but ai doesn't crack upsc prelims eaxm. event not got 30c/o
ai may kill corruption
maine 4-5 bar check kiya hai ki like diya yaa nahi
"thankyou sir, for realisation "
"ai ko explain karna sambhv nahi ,yah kaam ai bhi na kar saka ki ai future mai kya kar sakta hai"
isme solution kha hai

ai is algorithm with teaching data that can be manipulated
sandeep sir ko bhi ai replace kar sakta hai ye realty hai . nahi viswaas ho  raha hai to jao apni problem ai se pooch kar dekh lo. bas ek  emotional virtual body ki jarurat hai jo apne voice ke sath emotional activity kare.

"*bhai ye kis type k questions puch rahe hain ye log, bhai ai ye sab kar raha h, sare decision le raha hai...*
*main question to ye hai kya ai sex kar payega????*"
"sir is all points se ye pata chalta hai ki ai ek  99.99% human hai ,but ek good human selfish ban jata hai vaise al banega kya?
human kabhi kabhi chah kar bhi bad decision leta hai vaise al karega kya?"
ai can't feel can't think what we can't think.. yes ai is dangerous than nukes.. but we can feel we can think n still destroying our planet. what we're doing with all other living beings with nature yes ai can do the same
"amit bhadana ko kab lekar aaoge sir

"ai can't do time travel on the basis of sir's explanation from 15:50 to 23:25.
and its a kind of fun fact also that we & ai think on the basis of past but ai can't relive the past
and if whenever time travel will possible we humans will conquer that achievement ."

 indian motivational speaker
sandeep maheshwari sir
thanks you so much
sandeep maheshwari sir "
ai can't feel sir
sir moral of the story kya hai
god bless you 
ai can't enjoy sex
ai insano ko nahi bana sakta insan ai ko bana sakte hai
super information
ai can't clear upsc .
"ai depend on human whereas we use ai, ai lack of diversification..."
sir... kaafi had tak samajh aa gaya.. aap kya keh rhe hain..
"may be ai will able to do many things. but ai can't feel hangover of marijuana, lsd, and ayahuasca . oh poor ai."
best title for this video chhota bulbula and bada bulbula
the thing i think ai cannot do is filmmaking and direction and art and acting...
ai  har ek kaam kar lega.  future' me....
"ai may replace humans, but humans can also outgrow ai in the future."
ai not better than bhagwat geeta 
great man
ai pagal hai
प्रत्येक ह्यूमन  एक यूनिक कैपेसिटी से आपस में भिन्नता कर पाते है जबकि ai की इतनी बारीकियों से खुद को भिन्न कैसे करेंगे | ai से फायदा तो बहुत है मगर इसकी लिमिट भी जरुरी है|
human is also  nothing without thoughts and senses.... so what is difference between human intelligence and ai.. 
matlab padhai likhayi sab faltu?
"ai koi new song nahi likh sakta , koi naya dhun nahi creat pr pata , ya kuch bhi naya nahi creat kr sakta"
but ai can't judge us always because can we do sudden that ai can't judge. ai don't have any emotions.
"today's date_  1 / 5 / 2023
let's see where ai will take us in next 5 years. i will revisit on this video.. i want to know how many regular viewers are here those like this comment "
bhencho ab mera dimaag kharab ho gya hai ye dekh kar 
ai ke paas intuation powe nahi nahi
"le me when people argue ai will replace humans : 
me kya karu job chodh du fir ?"
what is sandeep so damn excited for? makes viewing the video infinitely hard.
ai can't start startup
mere ko kuch samaj nahi aa raha hai fir bhi me ye video dekh raha hu 
"@10:52 hamare brain me limited memory nahi hai ye galat hai , in your own session you said our memory is limitless. and ai is created by humans. we can't even imagine the amount of memory we have. ai will not replace human intelligence."
last sentence mujhe samjh main nehi aya pls koi explain kor do
ai naa to faad di 
but the human you are talking about is a ideal human being and practical existence of such being is impossible.
"

can't explain feelings in words"
"sir , ai ke uppar  aur ek part laiye plzzz ,"

"ai never can crack competative exam , beacuse ai works base on collective information which is straight forward but competative exam which conduct it's very tricky way so i thought ai never crack competative exam."
"ai ka apna khud ka koi greed nahi hai human ko control karne ka , big businessman's and riches of the world will do that using ai"
ai se insaan ki sochane ki chamata bahut teji se km kr rhi hai
fun fact is this video is also recommended by ai 
i think we are also a type of ai. made by some creatures called gods.
ai dar...... ko feel nahi kar sakta 
jis tarah newton ne gravity ki khoj ki ya jitrah scientist ne electro magnetic wave ki khoj jo ankhe nhi dekh sakti hai kya ai istarah  ka khoj kar sakta hai? ya ai wahi kar sakta jo information fit kiya gya ho ya jo information ai khud collect kiye ho..
ai is like angles they could not do mistakes but still human is better than angles if they make good decisions in their lives.
you r the best sir ji. always favorite .
"ai, sandeep sir ko nhi samajh sakta"

sir i thik ai god ko nhi define kr payegi na khoj payegi qyuki ai abhi aayi h lekin human ka god pe belive tb se tha jb se sirf insan the ye pure nature tha to god is the last limitation of differences between ai or human beings.
me watching being a student of ai 
"ai will be converted into di (deprived intelligence) if input is not feed ...

sandeep sir's, essence of this video.."
"yes sandeep sir is right because ai have  data and after certain our sandeep sir show may be replaced as"" a sandeep maheswori ai show"""
"sir ai human ka feeling ko ni samaj ni payegi
kuke humans imotional feeling   pa soch kar samaj kar design le sakta hai lakin ai ni la sakta vo bs apni stor memory par he desegen la sakta hai

"today i finally understood what actually an ai is . best logical explanation so far regarding why ai is what it is. thanks to sandeep maheshwari sir.

sir i have a ques u are saying ai can do whatever a human being can do on psychological level . then what will happen to human beings. how will they survive ?"
"this is called the ""expalaination"
ai ke pass human ki sex karne ka time pata nehi hota .... mood/feeling kaise ata hai usko pata nehi hota .....!  kuch logo kee bus / metro / tram peee penis  khara ho jata hai ..... ai crime koooo band nehi kar sekta ....!

human khuwab dykhta hy waha sy invention krta hy
human revealed knowledge base hy half
ai only acquired knowledge base hy"
iq level of ai ...?
"agar us meditative state me thought nahi hai nahi output hai to vaha jane se result kya hoga (matlab mera kya fayda) 
aur agar fayda nahi dekhna to vaha exist karke me kya antar la paunga is duniya"
"ai सन्यास नही ले सकेगा  अगर वो शून्य तक पोहचा तो ai खत्म, क्युकी हमारे साधु संत ही उस स्थान तक पोहच सकते है वो भी आध्यात्मिक मार्ग से और ai कभी आत्मा नही बन सकता क्यू आत्मज्ञान आत्मा बिना संभव नहीं वो रोबोट ही रहेगा।"
ai meri tarah pichware k sath sath dimag se v hug nahi sakta.
sir please tell about the most and most negative distruction or situation that would be created by ai
ai can't love
"in short, i am that can't be experienced by ai"

very nice person sandeep sir ji  
aaj ke session may sandeep sir ki energy high level pe mahsoos ho rahi hai one of the best line sabse best hai human exist krte hai nice sir
creativity not for ai
"ai can do everything but never understand any human's feelings. 
this is the biggest difference between human & ai- according to me"
i think ai cannot replace athletes like the way our emotions are attached to a sport the way we enjoy them
"ai bachche paida nahi kar sakta.
ai eishwar ko khush nahi kar sakta"
love you sandeep ji 
"even ai cannot say how this world was created , ai don't exist remember  





time......."
artificial intelligence can't beat doctors 
i'm a unemployed person but after watching this season i'm just thinking ki ye ai meri job na chhin le vencho
jo iss session ko samajh jayega wo duniya badal sakta hai
thank you sir
high level ki bat hori hai. sab energy hai ap bhi or m bhi sab prbhram hai. universe hi hum hai or jo universe se beyond hai vo bhi.
sir....apne to ai ki dhajiya ura di...
ai tho bahut dangerous or bahut achha hai but ham kay kare ai ne sab control karliya tho ham es world me  q hai ? 
 great sir
ai is far more dangerous than you think -elon musk
best explanation sir 
without input & output ai doesn't exists but human exists
excellent sir 
"sabse best guru 
sandeep maheshvari sir "
great unbelievable
not only that now ai also have emotions a research conducted on auckland is completely based on ai emotions
i doubt if ai can be like a mother who cares for a small baby to young child. educators in daycare would be difficult to be replaced by ai. and ofcourse also making babies ;)  family loving and caring for each other can't be replaced by ai
make a meet with @harshasai
"we want this sandeep maheshwari instead of
meet this or that.

please make a series on ai related videos.
"
sandeep sir is best life changer 
kon kon elvish bhai ko bulana chata hai
sandip sir explain --- jiddu krishnmurti way
sandeep sir ka kahna hai ki hume time ke saath khud ko ko upgrade karna hoga...nahi to ai humaari jobs replace kar degi....
"q. why human intelligence>>>> ai ? 
ans : it was us humans who created ai."
thumbnail wali ldki ki id? 
i think advocacy me ai ka koi khas scope nahi hai kyu ki court me case file karne se le kr win karne tak me indefinite stages aati hain aur apne aap me ek dusre se different.
ai baccha paida nahin kar sakta 
sir ashneer grover ko bhi bulaiye show pr.
"can ai have biological pain that we humans have?
it takes nose, wind pipe, lungs, and brain to feel the air, not just brain."
ai feel ni krr sktaa or new things explore nhi krr sktaa
6:27 playing chess by computer is also called self decision by ai
kise kise meri tarah aaz hi pta chala hai ki sandeep sir.ko ai ki bhi itni knowledge hai 
sandeep sir shayad uploading me galat fahmi hui hai . spirituality ke channel par karna tha 
"ai hum logo ko gulaam bana lega sir ne saaf saaf kaha h 
or jaise aagrezo se bach gaye hum log baise ai se nahi bach payege q ke hum log inse nahi lad sakte h "
iss session ko samajh ne ke liye  band kar ke imagination ki duniya mai khoo jana padega ; warna ye session apne time se 1000 years aage hai .
now i am thinking..maine kya pda tha or hua kya 
"sir, is doing mbbs good ? should i go for mbbs or other fields ?"
"sandeep sir, matrix.. sach toh nahi hai sir.. "
sir ai par second  video baniye
ye video dekhne ke baad mai agle 1 ghante tak apne future ke baare me sochne lag gya
2:20 matlab mere mind me ai and chatgpt chal rha hai or planting 
ai kabi bi human ko bilkul replace nahi kar sakta.
ai can't imagine like human
6:27 =ai can take self decision which is called common sense and  resonance which is one of the properties of ai
"ai khud se jyada inteligent machine nahi bana sakta
jase human ne use banaya"
each and everything of humans can be replicated by an artificial intelligence because both ai and humans are made from elements from the same periodic table.theres no magic saus in our brains
ai kuch kare ya na kare .. par uske use sabko lazy krdega
artificial intelligence can not ask questions like humans so they will never be able to exist without us
"yesterday : human intelligence on top
today : ai vs human intelligence
tomorrow : ai over human intelligence
q. why human intelligence>>>> ai ? 
ans : it was us humans who created ai."
matlab . hum sab bhagwan ban ne wale hai .
"ai gana nhi gaa sakta or song , song nhi likh sakta gehrai se composition nhi kr skta h jo hum chahte he sports nhi khel sakta"
did you see the hairstyle of sandeep sir if yes then like
"i was watching the documentary on ai and thinking what about sandeep sir perspective on this 
ai software like ""replika"""
"in short 
humans can sleep, ai can't 







just kidding
great observation sir "
i think ai can't create new things
"ai powerful h bht, kbhi computer k high level k against online chess khelkar dekho."
"this is  advaita vedanta

sir ai ko kaise samghe ek video banaiye
can't agree with this guy.. don't know why this guy is talking like he is an ai developer or a specialist in that field...

ai imagination nehi kar sakta jo input dunga ohi mila jula kar banaye ga sir !

artificial intelligence can not become a detective
artificial intelligenceᐷ humans intelligence 
i really love you sir 
"ai can't imagine, but human's have imagination, creativeness"
"गुरुजी , आपने समस्या को तो अच्छी तरह समजा दिया लेकिन  उस् समस्या का समाधान कुछ निकला नहीं या तो हमे समज नहीं आया की अब इस परिस्थिति मे हम यानि मानव बुद्धि(human intelligence) क्या कुछ अलग(अद्भुत) करे तो ,हम इस समस्या लड़ सके या तो उसी कृत्रिम बुद्धिमत्ता(artificial intelligence) का उपयोग करके आगे बढ़े ??? "
sandeep sir ka bhi jagah ai le sakta hai
ai can also be p m of india
ai khaa pee nh skta sans nh le skta
such a deep understanding of ai by sandeep sir 
ai hila nahi sakta
sir artificial intelligence might be able to do anything but it can't motivate us like you
the key to artificial intelligence has always been the representation.
ai bacche ko janam de skta hai?
sandeep sir lekin jo ai ko good things or bad things ke samaj nhii hai na
very nice moment  last line super 
agar na samajh aaye to iron man ka jarvis aur friday ko dekh lo then it will be easy to compare ai and hi
fight ai vs human 
sir it was an absolute pleasure to see you live and i  feel so blessed to be a part of such a relevant topic which will be our future. 
ye thumbnail me jo ladki hai.....
ai se nikalne ka rasta batao sir
ai का जनक इंसान हैं तो इंसान से बड़ा kon हो सकता है 
"i think utilisation of ai should be limited either it will be advanced or not, for society and environment. and quantity and quality are equally important,both are dependent on each other."

sir apka spiritual channel bhi hai ek. bhool gye kya.
this session is another level... one of the best. we were missing this sandeep maheshwari because of 'meeting with someone' sessions.
is session ko bahut jyda hi deep mai samjhane ki jarurat hai .
ai = sandeep maheshwari sir 
"jaise bole na ki ai ko pta h 2 bje kya dekhte ho, do a correction ye usa based ai ko pta h tumhari kundali"
just waiting for ai to get offended by this video and finish the entire human race.
ai hamare parents ki tarah nahi bol skta ki phone chalana band karo... ulta voh hame phone ka addict hi bana raha hai
you aware me this truth so thankyou
"sir ai is limited ... but human thinking is limitless ..
ab sir ai kami toh bta dega but solve khud insaan ko he krni hai ..."
banning ai is not the option but banning usa based ai one of the very big option....
"क्या ai सोच सकता है कि चीजें ऊपर से नीचे क्यों गिरती हैं

ai सब कर सकता है पर प्यार नहीं कर सकता 
i think ai will be self-conscious in distant future just like humans when fusion of human brain with machine brain occurs.and in that paradigm human and ai will be the same. hence i disagree with you.
artificial man jo data ham  add karte hai uske relative work karta. or human artificial data gernate karta world mai public ka kya dimand honga kya future mai public ko chahiye. us data ko banne ka kam human artificial karta. kyoki robert public ki demand kyoki public turant result chahti. jisse human artificial  ne public demand se hi utara hai.

artificial intelligence hack ho skti hai human intelligence hack nhi ho skti
first of all... if there is no human then there can't be any ai. because most of the ai and chat gpt were trained by human or man made software. thats why there is no existence of ai without human.
ai just learn everything by taking input as training data. new physics math bio theory will be never came out of ai. but ai can help us to analyse all statistics probability and all derived equation to proof our theory mathematically.

"excellent perspective sandeep sir, but i think you should give some more perspective on how to make career ai proof / how we can sustain in the world of ai?"
"human can feel sound of silence while ai can't, that's the difference"
ai will never  understand and able to know beyond five senses psychology .ai is not in a position to do critical thinking and analytical thinking. ai will never able to know the ultimate reality of self and phenomenon  .

"i am working on an ai, which can diagnose diseases and solve easily"
creativity ai ke pass nahi hai 
ai jhooth nhi bol skta
"sandeep sir= motivation+fun+intelligence
"
essence of whole debate is ai can not exist without information and can aware for himself but a human can enjoy just pure awareness joy and bliss but it should be understood with experience and sundip sir really nailed it 
sandeep sir is the multiple intelligence person. he knows almost all thing.
"sir, but limitations marked in the case of michel jackson to prolong his longevity  was not possible . such impending factors may not be overcome by  ai ."
"this session was beyond imagination by sandeep sir 
sandeep sir is the best human in all world.. "
after 100 years when ai will take all the jobs humans do. then unemployment and poverty will happen people will starve and die.  life span of a person will be very short.

our imagination about future give us success in career."
sir agar ai human se bhi jyada sochta or samjhta hai toh kya hoga future me kya ai human ko samapt kar dega. because jis prakar human apash me fight karta hai usi tarah ai me bhi filling hoga .
but ai fail in upsc prelims paper

love you sandeep maheswari sir
"ai cannot be creative, ai can work only on the information given to it, but it cannot create new information. for example, you need a script for a video, you tell ai to prepare it for you, ai will prepare a script based on the data given to it, but if you give this job to a human, he can create scripts without inputs"
nahi sir nahi human ke jaisa  na thaa aur na hee koi ho saktaa hain... emotions/life kewal human beings ke paas hee rahenge..... ai ke paas nahi sir jee

"i believe that ai can't have emotions till now and in future also
and emotions are the only thing where all the religions are based. so in future the sector which has more in danger is religious sector, if ai replace human being, the religious sector were demolished."
i think spirituality is help us but ai can't understand this that reality of humans  life we all are connected but how we can do that ..?

in psychotherapy field ai work body easily but many side effects cause in our body.
"i think what sir mean is that ai cannot think outside the box. for example humans can invent something ( let us say "" x "" ) which hasn't been invented yet but ai cannot do that as it works on the basis of information around it and because "" x ""  hasn't been invented yet ai cannot think of it as ai has no information regarding ""x"" in its database."

"only human command can control ai , not ai control the human, human has an intellectual power to make a quick decision , but you have to control ai to make it understand what to do , or not , 
overall if i were a boss of a company need man power ..not ai power , information power is limited but intelligence power is unlimited "

"conclusion: ai works on the basis of input and humans cannot overcome it in any way

humans have consciousness and can exist without input and output but ai can't

ai can't understand, can't feel  meditative state, emotions (where new ideas are born)

ai is more strong than humans and know everything except when one is in pure silence"
very wonderfull session  about  ..ai
i think this much dependence on ai is enough it should not be increased
kabhi nahi pahunch sakta human brain k equal
"nahi samaz aaya..

"human intelligence and ai are not directly comparable. they have different strengths and weaknesses, and the ideal approach is to leverage the strengths of both to solve complex problems and create new solutions. what do you think guys?"
unfortunately ai will be dangerous for human beings
"well ....ai is gonna cause a catastrophic in future  ..
mark my words"
sandeep ji can ai discovery new things and can ai gets mullick vichar

chai ka darbar kishundaspur up 50 me swagat ba
dear sir agar ai सब कुछ कर सकता है l तो हम क्या केरेंगे l हम ai jo काम करेगा वो सही है या गलत है इसको देखेंगे और अगर हम लगेगा की वो हमारी दुनियां को ai खराब कर रही है तो उसे change kerne का काम केरेंगे बस यही काम रहेगा हमारा। खेती केरेंगे। या तो ai से भी भयानक चीज बनाऊंगा जो ai को तहस नहस कर देगा qki हम इंसान हैं हर चीज बदल सकते हैं l

"ai is far better than humans , i want ai to replace humans 
 may god replace humans by ai"
artificial intelligence does not have emotions and feelings. and ai does not have a relationship of love and affections because ai does not have feelings and emotions .
sandip sir is best human intelligence can you accept it
artificial intelligence does not have emotions and feelings. and ai does not have a relationship of love and affections because ai does not have feelings and emotions .
"abb tak ka sabse best question puchha hai kisi ne , iss par series honi chahiye alag alag job par brain storm karna hai"
artificial intelligence does not have emotions and feelings. and ai does not have a relationship of love and affections because ai does not have feelings and emotions .
masterpiece!
artificial intelligence does not have emotions and feelings. and ai does not have a relationship of love and affections because ai does not have feelings and emotions .
i got little bit the difference between al or human intelligence. difference is that ai intelligence without inputs or outputs can't exist but human can exist without information or any perception. 
wo omkar hai sir i know very well ham sab wahi hai 
love you sandeep sir ..
good
thank you 
ai will be a threat
"ai cannot create the great poet like william wordsworth......ai cannot make music composition like pink floyd, eagles......there are lot of examples....."
sir ko ek series banani chahiye ki a.i. ko use karke apne business aur job mein success kaise haasil karein for future
sandeep sir is the best and pure motivation.... with fully confidence...
ai humans ki line wali hai kuchh salo me
"conclusion- ai sabki vaat laga dega 
kalyog = technology"
"meanwhile chat gpt failed iit/jee, neet and upsc exam "
sir make  video ai part 2 based {}....
ai  insan ki problem find out kar sakti but not solve their problems because insan ko moral support chahiye hota ek mrne wale pta hota h ki wo nahi bchega fir bhi wo yahi sunna chahata hai koi yah bol devki kuch nhi hoga tumko ai kabhi insan ke mental health ko nahi fix kar sakta ai bhi man build technology
according to me this is one of the best episode 
only 1 think that ai cant do is cant understand  girls 
"pahale se ye baat dimag me chal rahi thi.
but not so clearly and maine bhi ye baten aapse hi suni thi.
wahi se dimag me aaya.
but mere ko ye samjh nahi aa rha ki ye kis nadi ki baat kar rahe hai?"
sir ai ma imosan nhi ha
i believe this is the best possible summation of the entire debate around ai. and this will become the key to lifestyle in future generations. this particular piece of content by sandeep sir would be used not just by people now but for generations to come...
sir bahut hi kamal ki chij hai ai chatgpt
"human ai bana sakta hai..
ai human bana nahi sakta..programming karke"
excellent knowledge
i am fain sandeep maheshwari sir

i am planning to learn about ai 
ai emotional nhi ho skta sukh dukh sardi garmi feel nhi kr skta..
please make next part ai vs human
karne ko kehne ko kuch nehi rah jate hai. what does it mean?   
sir jo bhi ho ai can never overpower human intelligence kyuki human ne hi ai develop kia bnaya upgrade kia by the time agar wo koi bhi capabilities tak agar gaya ai fir bhi use human ki need pdegi hi kyuki jisne upgrade kia agar us level tak toh sochiye khud insaan bhi to usslevel se aage nikal jayega
5:48 as a psychologist and an ai specialist i would say creativity and consciousness can never be replaced by artificial intelligence from humans
mind reading nahi kar sakta ai
one of the best session
"ai can't be  good leader, ai can't do negotiation, ai can't be a youtuber because human can only feel connected with human"
"my teacher = make a presentation on ai

le = using ai for making presentation "
he is very honest person.... aaj bhi iss duniya me aise log hai jo peso k peeche nhi bhagta.... i think sandeep sir ko elections ladna chahiye... sare neta har jayge
comments mai sab sale chaplusie karne aate hai no ads ye wo are wo banda kya samjana cha rha hai wo mat suno koi he's warning u save urself next 20 years is going to be very unpredictable
sir ai bachcha bana sakta hai ya paida kr sakta hai 
in short he wants to say ki ai sb kuch kr skta h but we r humans ye reality h we r connected to  nature and  to the universe....and yahi h jo human ko human bnata h.... nothingness jo ki sirf human k pass ho skti h but  ai can't exist in the state of nothingness but human can....it's amazing....but i can't imagine the future it's scary 
mera man kar raha hai kisi ashram me chala jau ho sakta hai ai chhod de
sir apne kya fudddu jawab dia... question tha ki job jaegi tu future mein paise kaise kmae for survival but ap consciousness khi aur nikal gye
"john mccarthy was one of the most influential people in the field. he is known as the ""father of artificial intelligence"" because of his fantastic work in computer science and ai. mccarthy coined the term ""artificial intelligence"" in the 1950s"

sandeep sir great man whole world
"ai me emotional intelligence nhi hoti naa 
ye bolo koi 
mtlb robot kbhi ye nhi bolega 
haye re mujhe meri robotni ne mujhe dhokha de diya"
to kya ai  humans ki jagah le lega?!
ai can replace mannual workforce in future..
"sir, ever call a robot on your show."
ai made by humans.
ai vo.... nahi kar sakatavahi jo aap soch rahe hai
like all who loves from sandeep maheswari 
"ek advice de rha hu lelo jeevan sudhar jaaye ga 
stop reproducing no kidss believe me they'll suffer ai is just to replace human"
"sir also human can question to ai
but ai can not question humans 
this thingh called is consciousness"
the difference between ai and human you explained was extremely amazing thanks sir 
ai can't think beyond thoughts and input. and we are human so we'll find the best way to control it.
jab sab chiz ai karega to human exist karenga what will be there role is there anyone interested in this talk
"ai ki sabse achi baat hai ki wo insaan ki tarah dhoka nhi deta 
i love ""ai"""
"why can't ai be conscious? or can it? i had an insight during one of my meditations that existence is not human centric. can't it be your human bias that only humans can exist without perception? as humans are a conduit of true intelligence(beyond memory), ai can also be the conduit of true intelligence i think. maybe a new specie"
sandeep sir great great
sir full form me hai  mast
what a explanation yrr .  thanks sir 
who's face is that in the thumbnail
after 50 or 100 years this video will be shared and appreciated by that generation and discussed what he says today.
"i am an ai engineer and iit m grad. in near future , ai will surpass human intelligence in every mental modelling. humble suggestion to all young people, learn this tech."

fun facts : ai cannot be smarter than sandeep maheshwari 
mai bahot khushnaseeb hu ki mai sandeep sir ke era me hu 
wow amazing 
sandeep sir is genius... 
everyone had the same feeling when computer was first introduced to humans. jobs are replaced but infinite number of jobs are also created. similarly with any technology if we embrace it rather than being afraid of it. it can create progress and opportunities.
"no matter how much revolution is gonna come, ai can not become sandeep maheshwari. sir will always live with generation to generation"
amazing session
after watching this session i sense that there are going to get some chances of conflicts within ai itself that can outburst and catastrophic to face
most awaited session

"ache se smjh nhi aaya , wapas dekhunga sir ne joh depth mae baat smjhaya hai uske liye ek aur baar dekhna hoga"

ham insan ko itna acha aek rasta mila he is sharir ke madhyam se lekin hame hi iski koy kimat nahihe"

thank you so much sandeep sir  you are world best sir no one like you 
"ai can't ask who am i ?

new thoughts devlop nahi kar sakta ai
issan chota ai he
arree you guys forget about deep learning and machine learning so that it can give different answers each time in a better way.

"ek like to banta hai sandeep sir ke liye

"ai reproduction nahi kar sakta ...
so  sigma reply of god to ai"
"ai future me sab kuchh kar paaega
ho sakta he ki vo bhi kar le jo insano ne socha bhi na ho"
mujhe aisa lgta ki future me ai ek chiz nahi kr paye ga vo hai sprituality aur god ko jane ke koshi krna kyuki yeh ek chiz hai jo aj tak insan bhi nahi jaan paya to bus ai ke liye yeh krna impossible ho ga
"good, forceful motivational talk. but consciousness is a big thing. it can't be in the domain of ai."
"ai uska job lega jo wakt ke sath badalne ko tayar nahi he ya jo aapne kam me best nahi he, i am visual artist and working as a freelancer.. chat gpt and midjourney jese software ne mera kam or asan kar diya he ese kam jisme ki time waste hota he aab vo kam ai kuch minto me kar deta he."

ai can't reach god ai can't get krishna conscious
great teacher for me after my parents love u sir .
artificial intelligence will not have feelings and unconditional love like our mom dad have for us as i think 
"what the hell is this.....,

ai will never replace humans !
keep in.mind that ai is also created by us or humans."
"it is the future, i believe, but human beings will end due to ai, this is also a fact in the future... "
people are mistaking memory and information for intelligence. you gathering information and thinking you are intelligent will go away with artificial intelligence.
sir muje apke shat bath karna hai
jo mom dad ko pyar kar ta hai woh comment karo 4:48 4:49 4:50
sir mere toh manna hai ki ai ko badhawa na diya jaye warna dhire dhire ye robot movie ki tarah pure world ko barbad kar dega aur apna varchasva bana lega

"ai बदल देगा दुनिया
एक समय ऐसा था जब किसी जानकारी के लिए किताबों को खोलना पड़ता था। फिर इंटरनेट की एक क्रांति आई और उसने किताबों को खोलना का काम लगभग खत्म कर दिया। कोई भी जानकारी चाहिए वह आज इंटरनेट पर मिल जाती है। लेकिन अब आर्टीफीशियल इंटेलीजेंस (ai) का जमाना आ गया   "
ai will never replace digital creators those who are upgrading their skills

"if you think ai will be a boon to society at large,  you are wrong."
people are already afraid of ai. don’t scare them more. ai will generate job which will save humanity.
so this is candy on you tube.......ok love when u were hot asian chicks and 007 made for tv movies

ai will rule the world
it seems like the ceo's job could be easily replaced by ai.
"""robots don't pay taxes"" well said!"
it is dangerous to the whole world that ai can be out-developed in china.
it is very simple to understand why ais would beat humans. ais can remember everything....
"all great, but still just like any other industrial invention i do not see how this solves any of our bigger issues"
why so much hate and worry? i love this generation of ai and i hope it gets better and better
good luck china
"if aiwill remove jobs, the us will definitely be affected, but not nearly as much as china."
interesting 
can ai predict the person becomes homeless?
"now, invent all driveless autos different than typical autos. teachers replaced by ai ."
great job in allowing ai to take over the world.
"ai, will be the worse can happen for the regular guy, you and me,,."

i could have watched this for hours. excellent documentary !!!!!!
you guys are very good at story telling
"people are worried we'll starve because,  robots will be hired over humans."
do those robots have heart to not run a pedestrian down.
i was hoping to make robots like short cercuit in a form of human beings act out my stories for my entertainment.
if you think homelessness is a problem now just wait. people are always doing things that will bite them on the ass!
ai will create a communist society in which no one works for wages and everyone has a high standard of living.
great! there goes my job!
its 11:11 california tome knock on wood might give you good luck

what we will have is a way to subvert ourselves with machines we built
ai the new peeping tom’s.
we are not ready for ai.
only idiots think a cashless society is a good thing
ai is a bad idea.
so the people who made the ai is the who the people who owns the ai that is the government one percent
very very nice 
can ai predict  the winner of battle or a war?
"when the truck drivers lose jobs to machines, wont tht destroy the economy?"
"i for one, welcome our new ai masters."
wow! this ai’s imagination is schizophrenic!!
ai is huge in the medical world. i'd trust ai over doctors opinions on medical treatments on serious diseases.
"ai ai ai ohhh! flush it, along with all of its proponents!"
"climate change, plant a tree? now there's a new innovative idea, wow!!!"
"then don’t live in china , why are the turkish going to china then complaining about it."
"i enjoy driving, it sucks that little weirdos like him will take that joy from my kids,..."
in time ai will kill almost all of us. do *your* homework.
what is the point of ai if it isn't going to increase our quality of life?
the day you cannot tell the difference between talking to a human and talking to a machine will be the demise of humanity!
the face recognition are in airports
"""robots don't pay taxes"""

"jesus, ai seems to be targeting humans instead of climate problems!?"
the internet is all satans creation dont get too comfortable ai buffs and youth of this generation if you safe.
china does not have better technology then the us. this documentary is chinese propaganda!

great
this is fantastic.  we need this in the usa to help prevent the rampant crime.
great information
i love how diffrent it is lol

"nobody needs you in any way now, you need ai and ai doesn't need you.  the future"
"say what you want, but the ai beat the human."
50% of jobs?  men..marx will come back again. class fight
ai work  should be taxed  just  like laborers  are taxed.
"wth with the ai ?! , thats how peoples gotta get lazy and be overweights ! believe me ! lol !"

i love how these people only refer to us as data. that's all you are to the world.
"i love china, and their ""technologies!!'"
ai is so hot
and what happens when the ai start to produce their products or creations without the help of us (humans)...
"thank you max, peace."
ai is pure  evil
ai has no empathy and would happily start ww3 if it sees it as the logical thing to do. i find that worrying.
thanks for keeping us all updated brah !
who will be able to buy what ai produces when no one works
how tf does a truck with no driver get gas/charge/do outside maintenance?
wow  9:40
good morning president xi 
there is no ai that duplicate my natural world
ai for predicting marine fish populations. although it may seem easy there are many variables that are difficult to quantify
coming soon.... airplanes with no human pilots.
38:00 then there's your answer > you're in the wrong business.   no brainer. y torture yourself
"um, that's not ai. that's a lie to sell useless products to idiots."
ai is memory & memory needs a steady supply of voltage to remember
don't give robots free will.
*thanks frontline. i enjoy all your documentaries. lets us supports our local pbs stations.*

ai suppresses freedom
how are we going to do what we love if ai is taking all the jobs! lol straight evil.
"they all love freedom, but they works for the system that rob their freedom."
i love the ai. i use it to render texture for my vr worlds all day! :)
trying to blame ai for the bad intentions and criminal actions of humans?
so if i make friends w ai early on i should be good
some historians say mao killed over a hundred million of china citizens to gain power
so can they analyze a bunch of case studies for different diseases and find the best cure.
i love a.i.
using the brain to use more of the brain
i do see the problems with ai. freedom etc....
i feel like it will end up being whoever has the best a.i. for war will control battle bots and planes to control the world
"outstanding!
 fire  water "
so they already knew ai 's bringing shit to humanity 3 years ago.
this is good news
"ai is a problem will be a problem and there is nothing the governments can do. lol.
all governmental system is a farce."
just another tool for billionaires to sell you their junk
"""founders"" of gulag is a good 'story"", i don't buy it."
"klaus scwab said the ""great reset"" has a big problem and it is the middle class."
"who is supposed to buy all the goods, pay the rents and feed the economy as has always been with a penniless population?"

good video
glad i'm old and my time here is almost up.
"catching up?  . . .  .or flawless victory, brutality!?"
it's bugged out how this is presented like ai is ok

the last quote says it all. thank you rob 
ai will come home to roost...
the only people that the ai revolution will benefit will be those who control it.
ai will cause a domino effect throughout the industry

"ngl, “bamboo curtain” sounds hella racist"
"if ai is going to take over, when will it buy up all the ai stock?"
thats fine if the majority of jobs go ai. as a mechanical engineer ill still have a job.
wow aliens are landing from their alienation because they sold us our. time to die
china is a perfect example of a hyper-capitalist authoritarian centralist nationalist government.
how do i know ai is smarter than humans? because ai wouldn’t make something that could displace it.
the title should be : the age of ai looks bad because china has mastered it.
"ageism on parade at every last one of these ai companies. hey frontline, how about a documentary about that?"
we are computerized robots. read your designed body. i knew this about 6 years ago.
the bible foretold of an ai that rules the world. the image of the beast in revelation chapter 13.
thank you. watching from alaska.
ai is a driver of inequality.  ai is a source of inequality!!!
technology has given great profits to the owner class who rarely then pass the benefits to the workers.
unfortunately we are heading for ni - no intelligence
"ai has been manipulating humanity for at least 5 years already, probably longer"
frontline does a great job with their documentaries!
awesome episode.
good video!
24:21 only solution sounds like you have found a hammer now everything else is a nail
governments need to impose laws that require a percentage of a huge corp’s workforce be humans that receive fair wages.
"think surveillance state, think you will have nothing and be happy : ("
knowing humans im telling you someone going to find a way to mess up this ai blessing
"people celebrating as they contribute to the demise of the human race.

fools"
psychopaths create psychopathic ai.
wow. 23 years ago this is describing us today.
ai is gonna be a major headache and a major problem. i think that it is a dangerous thing
has frontline become a mouthpiece for the war machine that is american politics? another arm of our american propaganda
"an idea, that we had not thought of, thats good, a little bit spooky, but good."
show an ai company that has produced new non computer tech jobs or job description.
ai can do driverless trucks. however unemployed people don’t buy products that ai driverless trucks deliver
this documentary inspired me to choose ai as the topic of a speech for my school. thank you very much!
ai is killing us all
yeah! ofcourse they might get able to surpass an average person but they could never surpass one whom is extraordinary.
in one way its good bc ppl behave better for reward but them controlling u with punishment /reward system is kinda messed up
you want to know: the cockroach inventing insecticity. and the people going wow
ai doesn't pay taxes -
chinese is gonna use it for ccp not for the good of the people not to be trusted at all
the day a machine can beat a rally car driver i would be sad witnessing that
ai will never work...it's just an observation 
"ai. is. already. here. servers 
are. interfacing. with. main
frames.  its. one. whole 
system."
i robot future

good thing we are worried about drag shows
start programming robots! adapt and overcome. this is a new world!
development of technology is greater but use of development in technology to improve liveline will be greatest for ever
"so for your own good , no google assistant, no alexa and no facebook."
china is leading ai and attitude towards it about 10 years ahead compare to aging usa
ai will be mankind destruction..
wow just like 1984
how about inventing a pollution & congestion free way to transport goods.
surprised this documentary is not really about ai technology but a woke analisis on the “perils” of ai
wait until ai teaches itself what to do with the “codes” and we no longer exist
"ai is angel intelligence not artificial. (fallen angels, the 200 in control of this plane) ... book of enoch, cepher version."
this is garbage. china is so far behind in ai it's hilarious. quit blowing china. the ccp is a ridiculous regime
"this is very very depressing.  will the machines eliminate less qualified people, and turn us into a form of slave?"
the problem with technologies like ai are  not a technologies issue but ratner a capitalism issue.
"yay! china an using irresponsible $h!t to ruin our lives.

where have we heard that before? 

"
we can all learn to code ai
just remember where china stole their ai technology from...with the help of the bidens
the chip is the mark they can download your memory  dont let this main stream media fuck your mind
ladies  & gentlemen...  heaven & hell will reveal itself to the masses...  strap in!
"now set it up to learn and make card decks for magic the gathering, and i'll be on board with ai being great"
"ai + automation + robotic + energy storage = the rise of the collective.  we’ll either be free or enslaved, tbd."
20$ says some government clown is already preparing to hand control of our defense network to ai
the only thing china is good at is technology theft!
thank you pbs
"thanks youtube ai, for placing this in my feed :)"
"ok so if there will be no middle class, who will buy these products that we are producing using robots? 
the robots?"
1984 on steroids no thank you keep that shit in china.
nice document
"wow, pbs running a ccp propaganda piece with a narrator from the 1990’s, no critical thinking, just a platform for the ccp."
all these ai eyes and when a chinese balloon flies over usa... we get a blurry picture 0.o
a i just another example of how to cheat the system.  it's the human brain on steroids.
great show. very thought provoking. thanks for the insights !
i'm not in favor of all this ai stuff. i'm old school. china is on its way to owning the usa. i just think we're doomed.
"faith is the path
christ is the way
listen to the word

"question everyone is thinking but no one is asking.
how do they expect jobless people to purchase goods and services?"
be safe in christ god bless everyone  john 3:16 holy king james bible verse
ai will be a problem in the future!
i have heard or maybe read somewhere that ai is more dangerous than nukes...how true is it
block via google maps drive from china's endh commercial city buldng he long frist baiyun
could the legal system be replaced by ai?
ai are demons
i'd love to see a driverless truck go pull a car from a ditch... towlifebaby
it fascinates oneself how humans are always trying to come up with ways to destroy itself ...
so with chat gpt will china still be able to catch up with the us again?
i welcome ai.
at what point does ai actually become sentient or conscious or self-aware or what have you? how will we know?
neither countries are good for this world. 
"ffor jobs that get replaced by robots.  will that money saved lead to lower costs, or fill the pockets of the execs?"
"the politics of dancing,the politics of feeling good."
what a sorry future to humanity. congratulations on giving control to a foreign species. disgusting. just slaves.
"so why do human drivers have to stop and do inspections, but the robot doesn't have to."
and drunk driving!! that will be awesome..
"""exciting and up-and-coming technology"" is the path to idiocracy and self destruction. keep it up millennials!"
"with so much stupidity and garbage in the world,having a little ai touch is a much needed thing"
"man was made perfect,, but man seek after many inventions;;"
the guy who starts talking at 1:29:40 sounds like a perfect blend of bill gates and donald trump.
yes but remember 1 this god could very easily breathe n freeze  all of al up because god is the great i am
raitt
these documentaries are amazing.
deve!oping ai is like killing the human race !
the world/ planet is going to shit and all everyone cares about is profit ....... good fucking luck 
sohiaai
the percentage of crashes on ai driven cars is frighteningly disproportionately large.  i obviously prefer human drivers.
get rid of money and then everyone will embrace artificial intelligence
interesting
"they tried to confuse a facistbook and the ai.. the ai programs made thier own laguage, the ai's made up!! shut it down!!"
"shamefully, i have omitted the question mark."
would be nice to use ai to come up with a solution to inequality. its clearly a choice
8 human intelligence.  get out mfs
they always use the humanitarian reasons to gain traction but in the end the leviathan economic interest controls......
thanks
oh my god we will become half human half robot that's crazy.
not good !!!!!!!!
"this documentary blows my mind. how will each one of us encounter ai, handle ai?"
fantastic.
now we should really put on a face mask to fool ai
it all will be thrown away when china inevitably invades taiwan.
the narrator is making the video the best. i watched the third time tonight.
"interesting report, but describes next to nothing about how ai works."
"when machines do everything as well as a human, what will working class humans be good for? slaves for the elites?"
"ai, equals human laziness."
"pure evil, as with every technology ai will be used for evil, not good"
ai will change human behavior to a robot like behavior.
ai=anti-christ. the borg!
i hate these shows there is no ai its a program ai is self awareya dopes
"so i'm just waiting for kyle reese and sarah connor but their kind of running late here....
 i'll be back "
"morality is an illogical conclusion to ai.
go ahead, release the demons.
right forest?"
ai = we are summoning the demon
"nobody will know how to take care of themselves in the future, when technology is lost and only stone foundations remain."
not okay. no good will come from this.
verigood
good job freaking out the old people.
every single american needs to call their reps and say no thank you.  we will not consent and we will not comply
just like the internet ai will be abused. hope i don't get to live it to see the outcome.
ai is the beast.
i pray that when ai finally gets to america that i'll be long gone or somewhere  deep in the woods.

"a fair tax structure, free education, and universal basic income are going to be necessary."
great story 20 years to late....
ai...best way to spy on everybody....
fascinating documentary....on the dark side of a.i. and data mining.
what happens to the people that ai replaces
unfortunately it's all about the migthy $$$.
i am not sure why some people are threatened by ai. clearly ai is just a tool. after all without human ai wouldn't exist.
can you imagine an ai trump?
"artificial intelligence will do what it wishes just like the rest of us. 

"
of course the rich love it. i want to see wealth taken from the rich and given to the ai.
beauty facing the face of time
"learn from human then take over. ai can hack you, learn your habits, etc."
isn't ai racist though?
science is powerful!
i'll be off this planet before you ai people screw it all up!egomaniacs are the problem.....

i can understand why iran calls us the great satan.
aww i love america    as i stretch out in my hammock.

just wait until the machine becomes self aware
"s00ner or later. ai will figure out that we are the problem!
god help us!"
ai is humans defeating humans
the database of ai of that game stored a billion copies of moves and possible powerful counter for every move.
sorry. bad news for china. a lot has happened the past 2 years...and china will lag in many things..even in ai..
"recall what ms. alice walker said to mr. david ike about ""artificial...""?"
"ai can preserve freedom democracy creativity happiness, ai can stop communism."
"let ai choose the president, then ai can chose best one"
robots should pay taxes! there should be a law put in place
this is scarier then any horror movie  i ever seen . we will all be devoured by the ai algorithms .
soon jobs will be advertised  no humans needed only robots can apply ..lol!!!
that's why they created pandemics ..to kill all people and move in ai.
ai can stop animal testing.
thank you for this eye opener
one of the best programs i'v ever seen!thanks for show
robots don't do hand-waving
1:08:52 i love this office
can’t you just feel machines taking over the world?
"only two rules. 
1. the computer is always right. 
2. happiness is mandatory."
fascinating and depressing at the same time.
