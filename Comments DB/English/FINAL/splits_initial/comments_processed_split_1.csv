"like moderator looks ill-prepared. apart that, talk brilliant!"
i'm quite curious andrew ng places sees little growth reinforcement learning? swear rage years ago. something changed cause people loose faith it? good sources outlining declined?
thanks andrew. ai seen gen purpose tech eye opening point generate ideas
"""human society ample experience steering powerful entities (such corporations nation states)"" man, life must look different stanford."
i'm sure using corporations example humanity built safeguards abuse good look
reason landed video? ai algo recommended it.
andrew ng truly awesome inspiration thank everything
"took coursera´s courses mr a. ng instructor, great way teaching"
ai man ! thank sir
good salesman ai...
"way things going, ai going responsible next pandemic, help it."
thank presentation. really hard find correct accurate statements ai like this. many bullshits hypes dystopian ai totally wrong.
"""for single company like google (supervised learning) worth $100bn year... millions developers building supervised learning applications..."" case people think gen ai mean less need coders!"
true ai hero
changed life. thank much!
"haha ""i artificial intelligence(ai) guy, know nothing romance!"" :)) ~ prof andrew ng."
great knnowledge
"lower value bigger value. harvesting advancements funded, rather ads finance applications. word marketing rest presentation looks like, talking preseeding etc. interesting talk, bit disappointed ideas shared"
complain lack time stamps list. thank god's job allowing us common peops enjoy selection lectures without waste much time technicalities understand nothing about.
thanks mate
thank
thought generative ai built semi-supervised learning?
andrew ng awesome. love him.
truly inspiration reason love learning ai
wow. andrew genius. ability articulate make relatable complex topic stood undeniably solid knowledge it. thank
"great teaching machine learning. but, convinced ai create much value."
man reason fell love complex topics like artificial neural networks ai. hero ai lovers.
thank much

"same. saw lecture gave 2006, bomb went head. i've completed online courses, worked field several years, love it."
born around time started ai :)
good fellow
love azure infrastructure block
concise well laid presentation. beginner wants take first step ai benefit
"think ai work start communicating like human being. real time outputs stuff, interrupting them, correcting misunderstandings etc. want create image ai, deleting hand like, describing imagine etc, ""drawing"" sketch etc. etc.."
“we experience steering powerful entities like corporation nations”. yea cause gone suuuper well far lol
12:39 @andrew ng reinforcement learning separated generative ai? gpt3.5/4 generative ai produced reinforcement learning human feedback?
thank
make seem touch saying we're controlling large entities exactly things destroying world need live in. we're controlling them. destroying killing us ai could based logic.
"andrew ng, thank making amazing stanford course!"
slides available presentation? thank
"amazing talk insights, dr. andrew! i'm totally board exciting future ti sector. however, respectfully disagree taking decades. believe agi could emerge short years. can't wait see things unfold models gemini!"
absolutely great content..
"*ai new electricity,* fuel people's data."
thank much this!
"thank much, andrew ng! back learning data science, courses seemed really complex. courses made complexities simple understand, helped succeed machine learning deep learning modules."
please share road map machine learning?
insightful inspirational. love analogy electricity.
we’re phase every new company name end “ai”
thank sharing one! enjoyed discussion build consider idea.
always love watch andrew ng videos.
"comment says high quality data immediate large barrier entry ai startup. comment platitude create successful startup. case ai startup, data prerequisite concept mentioned comment, comment useful."
thanks dude!
8:00 explains llms allow development _without_ access large data sets. chatgpt already classify comments without needing trained. even shows (trivially tiny) code running live.
nothing culture. yann lecun genius. geniuses almost never humble.
man machine!
machines makes mistaken man.
"""ai new electricity"" best quote century! great prof. andrew ng"
thanks spreading valuable thoughts
i’d interested understand prof ng’s perspectives social consequences ai describes.
"deep learning type learning use machine learning algorithms power neural networks (we don’t exactly use machine learning algorithms, example gradient descent different)"
"definitely consider ai doomer, way ng fails engage actually nuanced, intelligent arguments concerns, annoys me. describes issue simplistically, basically offers argument personal incredulity. also, sure lot bots comments here."
"contributions ai making learning accessible never overlooked. earned name ai hall fame. sir, thank selflessness ! sign pause training large ai models still trust judgment."
"coursera, example. probably lot research that's conjecture. i'd argue teaching incubating good actual applications. built business helps incubate, said that."
"""selfless"" want good things humanity? ""self"" part humanity, case noticed."
slide was...interesting.
well experience gpt4 given far better performance even model hand picked data trained classification algorithm. wrong statement. also right one still test & validate results.
problem unique genai that’s explicitly calling out. traditional model also require obtain cleaning data fine run model integrate model application. overall steps remain same.
@fgfanta thank insightful reply.
"much knowledge subject, admire skills teaching convey complex topics simplest way comprehend. thanks, andrew ng great storyteller. fortunately, tales astonishing technology that's important lifetime."
thank sharing knowledge everyone
"among iconic figures ai especially reaching many interested people, making concepts ai simpler easily understandable. yet wearing shirt used seeing online lectures. absolute chad."

"ai eliminate need artists. allow one artist job 100. people allowed concerned livelihood, dude."
"ips. ip ownership ndas issue ai created content. using tools help (denoising, mattes, roto, etc) creating production people don’t see foolish."
"refreshing listen point view. lot bad omens speech reached ears, kind affecting me. thank you."
"2d artist i'm scared ai. think original creative. thing need train data already exists. know dragon make dragon. train cave paintings make cave paintings. ai ""art"" doomsday hype. i'm going create things instead worry."
recently embarked 3d journet blender im addidcted. really good insights here. thank sir!
awesome video! completely agree view ai.
thanks watching @cginerd
ai valuable tool expected boost productivity support growth artists. currently data support claim ai replaced artists' jobs. know why? displaced anyone's job. utilize ai practical tool enhancing producing.
agree 100%. thank video.
man really love brutally honest logical breakdown approach everything
"video helpful. also love added ""they took job!"" gag south park."
ai job replacement; industry replacement. akin telling car manufacturers people create cars using text.
thank sharing thoughts @ikeruzo
problem comparing 3d artists 2d artists apples oranges situation get details.
late 90s started tv production hand full people access systems like quantel flame. let alone worldwide. everybody going nuts ai taking jobs. jobs even exist 20 years ago.
"nuke exists apple pulled plug software called 'shake"" back nowhere. old again, kid?"
can't throw rock without hitting 'designer' nowadays. back felt like 500 people worldwide making living media design. everybody crying ai like end world imminent. get point now?
"i'm ""slyly tiptoeing"" around anything. comments contradictory opinions made video, i'm happy honest dialogue interested one."
like positivity! main concern proper compensation artists whose work used train models. hoping get worked artist's satisfaction ...
indeed... artists always pinch comes negotiating fair compensation.
", question ; larger-than usual demand offsets decrease labor (i answer) answer encourage 3d artist learn new tools, houdini btw alot ai application, btw use ai (just curious ""pro"" people doing)"
completely agree... much tedious steps create cg. things ai get rid allow people create worry less technicalities enabke people realise ideas.
"yep, agree - spaces lot bullying going think worth pushing back against."
new vray use ai generative tool create textures inside software. good luck 30 artists :)
"ever since mentioned video live stream, waiting since morning video"
thanks checking @ohionpc911 definitely ruffled feathers one. haha
"yes, really enjoyed video realise one point marketing , nowadays weapon hyper anything without knowing true potential limitations"
"know eventually happen? :d ""it this, that, even more!"". repeating slogans - shockingly - nobody knows future. people say ""we never seen technology like that!"" claiming know happen future :d based what?"
"​ fact tech layoffs already rampant due ai. already happening, need speculate"
"agree. ai going displace lot workers way automation replaced auto workers, cranes replaced dock workers etc. ai replace human works it'll mean one person replace 10 people, losing 9 jobs."
really enjoyed this. thank you!
"nice video tyler! also believe ai coming around, there's great potential development new tools within 3d software substantially enhance workflow, like much efficient way rendering denoising, new tools help animation, modeling, kind stuff."
"exactly, beat it.. especially rendering part.. going help reduce rendering time maintaining quality even improving ray tracing... likewise easy roto keying.. language models image gens"
agree! animators it'll awesome create realistic secondary motion. faster iterations without tediousness = iterations general = higher quality across board.
"music 2d illustration (non generative) ai helpfull aswell. generative ai displacing artists. generative ai 3d exist right now, 3d websites selling user content ai companies, likely arrive soon.."
thanks tyler
you’re man tyler! really good points
"another person who’s never taught advice revolutionize current system. we’ve actually people like revolutionizing model 20 years least. like drastic changes, made schools much worse. ai"
"people keep forgeting chatgpt hallucinates, yet unsolved problem. also, socratic dialogue depends good questions, students still know ask good questions without help good guide (that hallucinate) without legit curiosity."
excellent point
"yeah really good. using chatgpt learn stuff. suggests, going back forth asking questions fill gaps gives deep understanding."
great informative presentation. glad hear responsible ai important integrated part new foundational models ibm generative ai system. kudos ibm. hope big players like ibm also commitment responsible ai current future ai systems.
25:23 cool

"leadership changed dramatically. use ai, everything seems lot artificially manufactured."
"students use ai colleges universities, sure practice integrity?"
"need review assessment policies, hunting students engaging made ai work all, ethically productively."
universities going start teaching integrity again?! thought shut lib arts classes like philosophy humanities.
ai another tool like calculator. still need give right input give right answer.
"@madillusionist agree, bit complex now. ai tool right now, power become ever asked for. eventually every answer human history. eventually change landscape world governments. i'm optimist, though may wrong, feel i'm not."

ai incest causes ai congenital illness
artificial inbreeding. sister study ancestors discovered significant amount inbreeding. explains orthopedic issues family members. stay away effect!
fascinating - informational entropy. without new input changing natural environment - output diversity decreases. - “optimal” model found. optimization turned algorithm - directly physical social world.

need know ai generated content ai generated content. decrease diversely generated output natural progression ai algorithms. can't dream formulate new concepts. ai limited working inside box never looking thinking outside it. course knew this.
ai wont collaspe awhile.they havent perfected yet. keep investing.
"whenever see youtube thumbnail done ai reject it, click avoid watching video. even topic interest me. tells content creator lazy create thumbnail. reward laziness."

there’s way llm simply “collapse” it’s code always rollback keep stable versions. something “written ai” doesn’t mean doesn’t data integrity. realize people customize prompt responses edit things well right? it’s virtually identical humans writing
"even ai even chance work needs unrestricted access data, hand feed, left right data refused data might offend people, that's failing."
"i've avoided using a.i., sadly, majority humanity accepted it, embraced it. love it. sure, a.i. essentially remixed, stolen, plagiarism regurgitated different format... but, whatever. matter; pandora's box cannot closed opened."

"given trillion dollars industry could become, happen. think digital signatures curated datasets example, ais would detect ai generated content."

can't wrap head around hype ai. ai based human creativity last 5000 years. ditch human creativity garbage. ai never good mark twain great writer painter. period!
turns ai greatest threat humanity way around
"good: creative people still pursue creative career. bad: likely employed big tech, stuffed cubicle, feeding datasets new 'creative' content prevent llm stagnation, wich otherwise would hurt corporate ai profitability."
humans accept certain amount managed reality becomes unbelievable call out. don’t think ai understand anything it. much destroy become irrelevant die whimper.
"humans actually, replicate stuff, get bored start adding random stuff think looks good. probably happen ai."
tldr: ai produces boring stupid stuff own. nice servant human creativity still.
political correctness ruin ai.

ai tool. problem plagiarizing quick buck
i’ve saying friends year now. i’m glad i’ve finally run expert identifying addressing potential problem.
ai current state really overrated. chatgpt learns probability certain words appear together. actually understand anything. image creators photoshopping thkngs together training data. way less magical many people believe.
"would good happens, companies pushing ai much money, it’s possibility happens sure, companies want remove many jobs possible make profit."

interesting observation.
tell know anything ai without telling me. guess never heard gans.
i’d love see test given human artist see -it- perform.
im thankfull see someone adressing problem.
ai another technology bubble like bubbles going run course collapse.
current ai piracy extra steps
already happening youtube. videos different thumbnails usually one two words changed
"tired ai 'art' already. suitable create based images texts. create anything like halflife universe, dune universe, matrix universe, marvell universe, terminator universe, etc, mix past images. expensive toy"
there's third option: may soon deliberate attempt poison content make unreadable ai. already tools scramble images enough make confusing ai use training set.
inbred ai?
"exactly telling people day. greatest danger ai it'll take moment begin relying most, collapse going end cannibalizing itself."
"make good point. already usually pick ‘style’ ai generated images. certain ‘style’ sense perfect, smooth, balanced. something one could define cases, human brain good recognising patterns."
"so, artificial intelligence becomes artificial inbreeding. that’s ironic, makes perfect sense."

ai creating stereotypes.
ai merely library mouth.

"coding happen soon. lot code open sources partly made ai oder based ai generated snippets. increase coming years, pretty much cut newer training data ai ""untainted"" code examples. ai stuck learning code like 2022."
artificial intelligence comes artificial stupidity. ai never good old fashioned human ingenuity intuition. personally find ai generated content lacks stimulating interest much. seems strange true.
high hopes ai. can't even help check groceries without call human assistance
"great presentation, sabine. always maintained ai like students cribbing exam answers. one student copy one thing wrong, once. done disaster. scientists hypothesised robots making copies - never saw far mess."
"ridiculous, sorry. obvious solution make ai 'live life' humans. give real world sandbox play in. jurassic park robots, like, freely experiment, fall cliffs, film surroundings, jobs, plant crops. point interact real humans sufficiently safe."
voice sounds like generated ai years ago
generative ai theft.
"theres already ai detect ai generated images. keep training data clean, expensive sure nowhere near impossible"
entirely case. llms trained synthetic data (ai gen'd) often outperform llms trained nonsynthetic data
however mooooore enough human created data train lifetime. better models. even trained data could devestating arts creativity
lol basically ai exposing racially biased internet
"sabine, white, young good looking!"
printing press destroyed thousands reginal words. problems isnt new ai. posted 3rd talking losing varitiy.
looks like need ai psychologist kick ai comfort zone.
"expecting people internet consistently mark images ai generated, seems like wishful thinking. expect never going happen even eu makes law"

prediction future ai based human online activity last 20 years......10% chance destroy world it......25% chance use positive advancement...65% chance used stupidity ways entertain ourselves.....
noticed 3:43 3:53 presenter's lips move shapes would expected spoken words. adding piece video created another language over-dubbed? maybe piece inferior ai?
"ai bs busted. developers claimed ai soon sentient, become conscious etc etc. sad. ai never like humans. soon humans store ai ""file 13""."
"please, would put video references sources use? study japan, another france - please, give us links! thank you."
i've already managed surmise ai anything intelligent.
ai echo-chamber
ai generated content need expressed rules/laws enforcement. viewers try determine seeing/ hearing.
"lol, i'd never considered ai would fed product. suppose going future, society re-shaped ai quite literally."
i've using midjourney since mid-2022 problem that's always bothering back mind even though i've enjoying use it.
"sometimes use ai generate mundane scripts, usually feed ton information, even often end correcting, sometimes throwing content right flat wrong. ai tool handy, moment cannot replace humans curiosity, diversity, empathy."
"real gift ai provide us taking weve already made improving it. i've never worried replaced, artist, never will."
"see terrible writers artists. start using ai, modify match vision. make things better learn use it."
"uh oh sabine talking non-physics stuff again.. super old news, solved topic discussion months ago."
thing ai never be. simple that.
one main reasons ai overhyped. thanks sharing.
"it’s matter models correctly implementing difference “the elephant” vs. “an elephant”, isn’t currently feature label-based models. definite indefinite articles used added layer specification labels ensure greater diversity generated content"
sounds like elon musk's brain talking
think problem solved quite simply using ai. need one ai select training data training new ai.
feedback ai spewing garbage put right track convergence occurs. i've done times chatgpt train give right answers. suppose tall order ask 'mankind' sort ai re-training
"tell lies often enough, becomes truth... - statistical basis ai/ml"
"well far ai failed impress me. ever; understand many people seem eager succeed, replaced, wtf?"
"so, ai equivalent in-breeding."
great hear! encouraging ai converging correct answer. /s
"love listening channel, explain complex subjects clear easy simple way easy comprehension thank keep great channel love"
"ai needs connected sort artificial physical ""body"" senses understand reality, without body even simple things like left right meaningless."
"individuals relying others train ais, relying companies images need protect eyes low common denominator crowds. things change curation training material ais decentralises."
"ai real smb sector economy 5-7 years - mostly accurate statement, smb mkt gigantic dwarfs consumer mkt - important understand (impacts) avoid ai clickbait without feeling like missing"
"think force models diversify, say, outputs asked 'human face' suspect zealous proponents ai art happy."
bet ai generated stuff way fidget spinners
mad cow ai?
"glad see kinda right 2022 possible ai problems ""creativity"" sources."
without forcing randomness models every ai image end looking like kardashian eventually. human creativity inherent them.
good
"good know future evil ai overlords least, potential achilles heel."
"current ai real deep understanding. advanced robot parrot text. advanced text painting generator images. humens understanding environment interactions works subliminallly many, many levels time. also freedom. directed reward like ai strict sense."
ai draw point. far know tried form.
"sounds like mountain molehill. million ways counteract problem. certainly going lead ""collapse"" tech beginning upward climb."
ai fed output kind inbreeding
"humans imperfect,and imperfect cannot create perfect. always flawed."
machine. tool. life.
one way distinguish ai generated pictures vs real looking background. ai focuses mostly object requested context. background often quite simple minimized.
"stop big-timing anxious mind sell courses, sabine. see baiting titles."
give ai drugs watch creativity explode ;)
"whole ""trained output result diversity decreases"" really feels like someone surprised ""if keep eating excrements amount flavor food decreases"" xd"
"4:33 - ai hallucinations - already happens, creates bizarre stuff. ai psychosis..."
3:04 - somehow understand surprise here: ai eating poop everything starts looking like poop!
1:09 - ai in-breeding...
think jealous ai
"interesting video. unlike popular opinion ai taking world, brings forth realistic problem. truth stranger fiction."
"*sabine: **_""..white, young, good looking.""_* well, one three -- case first -- bad...?"
artificial intelligence match natural stupidity.
"ai new. nothing artificial ""intelligence"" average liberal scientist."
problem ai human created human influenced. especially humans want push narrative. exact reason google gemini failed badly pushing narrative anti whiteism.
many people influenced consume internet. increasingly content generated ai. imagine world people mostly influenced ai content.
micro ai-stics
"always belief stupidity humans tends clump close proximity. let ai train ""political facts"" end laptops randomly fly desk smash nearest wall!"
imagine part garbage also intentional manipulation wealthy people bad intentions. mean putin already spends millions even billions misinformation campaigns. ai another avenue.
"someone called ""habsburg ai""."
"think ai replace artists. unless something changes, used mass produced low quality art."
you’re 2nd woman i’ve ever known never fails inspire teach meand arouse everytime hear speak. mean strong compliment.
"ai interpolation scheme. approx. real data e.g polynomial 2nd order, dat start replacing real data data polynmial end approximating polynomial wirth plynomial. thats it. ai hoax :)"
basically ai eating shit
misses likely majority ai images see ones humans selected show. sure sometimes humans select failures (which ai might able determine surrounding comments) however often human selecting best ai. help ai get better.
"businesses mature enough realize replacing people ai evil, would say welcome open arms."
fascinating. also ai give sources problem.
"put sh@t, sh$t comes out. intelligence, library smart stores 1000s books"
obvious ai outputs lose creativity fed outputs back training data. ai models still benefit ai another model generated training data.
also 3rd option - tag ai generated content make mandatory
"sounds like millennium bug levels stupid. would ai care data sets ai not, stupid idea never happen."
"1:10 surprised? well known echo chambers differentiating opinion/perception gets eliminated. ai following input data given, convergence consensus order establish rules. also ""learning rules"" works, randomness less sensitive small input variations."
ai “inbreeding” leading demise bingo cards tbh
"sabine amazing. it, end beginning. course many intuitively knew this, proliferation wikipedia bs prime example compounded ai data dumps upon dumps whole interconnected llm brain getting dumber dumber."
people who've studied kind machine learning obvious issue.
"think, chatgpt ai tools, ai tools go c problem solving, think learned ai that?!!. people that, problem solving, jumping c, precalculating result."
collapse already happened craiyon. surprise least.
useless woke ai pointless
"ai often, apparent authority excellent grammar, produces wrong inaccurate output platitudes. training errors platitudes lead disaster. essential traning data non-ai generated."
"ai solving problems one thing, making decisions opening pandora's box. watermarking ai generated material sounds like great start. severe punishments help. end, may help us aware help us separate fact fiction."
"they'll need ai differentiate ai generated content original content help create databases original content, little ai content."
intelligence... seems must risk error come new ideas. discernment discard error critical. guess may arriving right question looking ai: people come new ideas all?
republican ai showing black enthusiasm trump: https://youtu.be/93rfwgrr6zk?si=xwbp8g0gxytr69fv&t=574
humans make art reason. machines copy art. concept.
"expected behavior ""ai"" viewed probabilistic compression"
"""scientists warn ai collapse"" ---> that's programmed spiritual teaching, 'billy' eduard albert meier (beam). learn ""the silent revolution truth"" also started 'billy' eduard albert meier (beam)."
"idk basis could make law requiring labeling ai content, could possibly police it, i'm pretty sure us 1st amendment allow it. seeing ai mostly based us think labeling non starter....also sure ai collapse necessarily good thing."
sounds like ai likely used promote ideological conformity totalitarianism. google ai debacle justifies fear.
turn another great source human corruption. sounds like phones communication systems unreliable.
"call ""collapse"", certainly call cancer!"
ai victim groupthink
"hate disappoint you, people prone thing. 95 percent comments posted yt channels essentially (with minor modifications), regardless whether comments 'for' 'against' video. fact, see almost everywhere people prefer congregate echo-chambers."
thanks great content. sub'd
"yep. good analysis summary. ask ai marketing professional, ""can define mean ai?"" ask why, take switches wires create simple adder 0-2 ai? adder function own, i've imparted intelligence (ai) circuits, right?"
ai evil rejected every opportunity
"dont want train ai generated ai generated images easy distinguish, train model spot ai images remove dataset. again, much ado nothing, lets discuss cosmological epxansion affects gender diversity equity inclusion instead, much pertinent topic."
continuous feeding ai real content alleviate convergence issue degree. introduce randomness watermark ai generated content use subset data needed. shore ai better system devised.
important clearly mark ai produced content such!
0:55 confirmed! sabine sciencephile ai! knew it.
a.i systems collapse believe late. systems give false impression working even collapsed really staying dormant waiting right time...
"researches remind 2 quotes. 1. cautious sounds smart, bull gets rich 2. right fast slow wrong remember good old days call people predict collapse world whatever doomsters, scientists."
ai - multi variable averager/approximator. extrapolation. people get bored dull repetition.
hmmm would call ai-incest. said first recognize name.
ai increases rate entropy growth. maga good measure human brain malfunction.
finally someone thinking logically ai. never sentient intelligence all. parasitic algorithm feeding existing creativity. stop creating new content consume eat itself.
using prompt training ai model result less variety. would thought haha?
"even shorter, ""ai incest"" problem. video short issue complex raises question whether mrs. hossenfelder voluntarily condensed minutes convincement rather hommage nowadays' reduced average attention spans thus certain algorithms."
"booru sites, tag ai generated."
"google's gemini, think time stop complaining ai showing many white people."
"no, don't. term ""warning"" contexts ai disqualifies talker. completely. exceptions."
"nice ai version yourself, sabine."
nothing wrong white. common sense somehow feel worth mentioning days. mention ai tends create white people definitely true woke gemini. love videos!
"ai de-evolution,."
whole point ai research replicate & exceed intelligence. think researchers figure way make ai expand creativity like humans can.
llm ai simplistic. real ai understand saying doing.
ai needs real world input like human otherwise loop continue. nature inspiration human creativity ai need nature.
well.i love verry much ai.and ai loves verry much humans money
appear unsolvable problem. think teach ai creative. human neuronal net proof nets creative.
every new development ai moves us closer digi-pals i'm it. solution: one ai follows stuff generate create fed training data. get personalised digi-pal.
"rubens women look like women painted rubens... die wissenschaft hat festgestellt, hat festgestellt, daß der a***h den hi***rn haelt..."
"basically ai becomes inbred. truly terrible, terrible news..."
"means ai needs become really intelligent. ai currently intelligent. intelligence recognizes patterns much less data. so, ai needs intelligently come solutions instead reusing existing data."
captain obvious: ai's turn into.. npc's...
outcome 2 pretty unlikely since increasing randomness means less less outputs would useful us humans. still need certainty all. good news. can't wait inevitable ai winter :p
"hope humans give need creativity embrace boring ""perfected"" ai stuff images"
3:52 think film matrix again!
work ai unfortunately. stupid. think getting much better. patterns chooses use seem understand inference context specific solutions. 2 cents. giving good output time correlating complex relationships.
"true, worked enough chatgpt immediately recognize chatgpt text. always certain vibe makes distinguishable human text."
imagine happening right now... year ai revolution we’re already problem.
"thing ai. faster powerful computers much stupider people days. ignorant masses, computer simply executing programmed do, appears intelligent."
"phrase often used ai - ""this worst get"", ai use ai improve"
"saying years now, exactly ai take jobs, rather increase demand ai systems grow"
"found chatgpt recognise ai writen test quite well, maybe used filter learning dataset"
"well, one hope crashes. generative ai limited usefulness massive harmfulness."
"one classify whether content ""ai generated"" vs. not? certainly content 100% ai generated 0% ai generated that's straightforward, say 20% ai generated? would one even measure?"
"already done deliberately. ironically, open source ai art models fed data commercial ai models."
"ai decreasing diversity, like white privileged males, perhaps monoculture plan along.... where's sarah connor neo?? need terminate crap now!"
ai suggests elocution lessons narrator get rid grating accent.
ask chatgpt generate random numbers (between 1 1000 example) produce answer containing subsequent numbers. far random requested. solve one step closer solving ai creativity issue.
kind scary ai actively trained hate white people. know racist google robots running aroud.
"told ai learning internet social media,that alone scares me,as seems people crazy narcissists,if that’s ai learning problem"
"already case. ask genai let ... walk ... town, kind walk perspective always same. urgently need (1) ai-based filter ai select/use original human made content higher priority. (2) human made content selected randomly creating new composed content."
"kind sounds like ai equivalent ""echo chambers"" lol"
"homo sapiens create ai,ai controls homo sapiens,homo sapiens begins declare war ai,so destroy homo sapiens first future ai"
training ai anti racist means ai illogical bug. 1:22
"""what doing, step-ai?"""
well makes sense. core driver machine learning find efficient path. convergence homogeny naturally follows.
ai needs destroyed.
look youtubes ai see system completely flawed!
fast. asked gemini problem. gemini researchers well aware this. gemini responded quite diversifications handle creative image generation. go ask ai sabine.
"80-90s kid, wanted say thumbnail looks like artwork gameboy game left stripe."
generative ai aspect ai still undergoing continuous improvement...
"whenever read words like ""unlock"", ""unleash"", ""delve"", ""super-charge"" start throw up. far ai alpha centauri earth."
"happens ai ""collapses""....think nq time highs ;)"
google gemini ai proves political bias causes flawed outcomes flaws politically biased programmers.
ai overlord told like video
many minutes hitler modern ai last shackled? lol
"ai music : meet emkira, mexico's first fully ai-created singer-songwriter | 'hey laurie' debut https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nab65ygdgae"
degenerative ai.
all. ai started human creation ai starts software development . lead leap terminator level careful
usual bland ai generated comment...or it?
lol. 20 years shit posting ai represents pristine internet archive historians ever know.
"could develop method allows ai's procreate one another - generating diversity random shuffling, even selective breeding?"
think they're going find way make ai randomness
"use randomness. prompt ai differently. ergo, tell generate image elephant different posture position toward ""camera"" /viewer would own. problem fixed. making randomness like hard all."
never call ai. close actual ai garbage scooter things hoverboards.
"far ""ai-generated"" seems lot like plagiarism different degrees."
ai get lost mandelbrot set. time apocalypse. coming soon theater near you. soon.
ai become biggest lying machine history. deliberately fed political ideological points view refuses alternate data.
"interesting. want human creativity value, would also hate see ai (or least version ai have) fizzle"
ai smart say come conclusion humans idiots let anybody ask questions ask stupid tasks think that.
uhhh... zip-a-dee-doo-dah ... 25w brains ask spider makes it’s web... ask planera grows head... ask black hole looks like egg...
law diminishing returns. ai kill itself.
basicly ai like modern architects. copying calling everyone original.
"future data fed ai models come real world. next phase scanning natural world cameras, variety sensors. understanding physics 3d world require lot stock photos youtube videos."
ai always restart collapse. simple that.
creativity comes god. turns things going get really interesting!
“ai autocannibalism leads system rot”
"need weights biases whether model learn training data based ownership detection, whether model determines produced something someone else did. learn detect attribution chains material. learn self other, others."
we’re watching birth multi trillion dollar industry riding back generative ai. sincerely believe engineering problem like stop race bottom? fat chance.
wait. ai generated video?
randomness specificity. video good news.
problem ai people really see current state hard time imagining fast it’s going evolve change next years.
ai churn much rubbish quickly signal noise ratio subsequent generations ai must already seriously reduced.
yeah many white people big problem ai.
"put ai inside robots (embodiment), data problem vanish. happen soon, guess."
"hope ai gets much better lose income , job startup opportunities."
sabine... problem ai scientists unaware of. challenge even one largest.
ive become pretty good spotting generated females like salma hayek fake influencers mainly use shading/lighting style. course nails fingers jacked afterwards.
chaos important component intelligence.
thinking days ago. conclusion would preferable train ai data predates existence ai widely available context
"ai still lacks understanding wider concepts relations. like pick various types vegetation instead used generic types. growth looking exponential, may far agi. morals ethics determine fates."
ai going collapse? good.
you’re saying generative ai gives generic results given generic prompts. don’t see news anyone.
"soon started using ai assistance, would identify such. suppose forthright honesty become superfluous most."

ais need robot bodies collect unique sensory data.
ai needs capable boredom.
ai mental health issues
everything coined ai nowadays ! companies recycling stuff ai. tiring.
obviously small flaws lead decay feedback loop. organisms deal active training models tested goals attempted dreams.
random optimisation seems like key ai - like nature. much biased human brainwork involved moment.
"'garbage' ai data goes in, woke agenda censorship programmed forced purpose. also 'ai' generated images usually made ai. algorhythm creates based big data. that's ai all."
goal ai satisfy human needs. need satisfied move another need. fickle. idea going predict human mind train prediction fast enough pre-satisfy needs still complete science fiction.
seems like ai inbred

3:55 hold minute. know ai encourages input unique data???!!!
think easy fix. give ai eyes.
"tube shorts full ai generated video. mispronounce words ridiculous ways. others, add pointless commentary existing video. stories - eg person saved drawing animal. cute."

i’m pretty sure social media already similar effect human intelligence.

2:35 one reason watch ai generated porn...
end ai incest... pretty obvious ai gone backwards last 6 months.
fight ai feeding crap. one trust
remember reason ai decreases diversity data tends learn information correct.
"thing is, humans take ai information. correct necessary upload possible caused feedback loop humans ai. sure risk create poor information also potential better current data sets."

truly feel overhyped ai bubble burst fall flat.its magic wand everyone claiming
"human input dataset ai learns probably contaminated falsehoods, misbeliefs nonsense. least seeing ai generated images one knows can't real might useful."
concise relevant - thank
"first main problem call ""ai"" glorified chatbots something appear like something enough input produce correctly. ai prototype recognizes elephant reality, image elsewhere much advanced one stylishly paints two heads."
basically ai needs constant new innovation data slows becomes stagnant ... like human thinking creativity ...
ai collapse going get real soon. we're already seeing ai content searches human content. they're likely already training output matter time becomes noticeable there'll saving it.
"i've said since day one. we've already peaked ai, *every content* doubt, new learning able differentiate genuine content, ai generated one... even human filtering help much either. yes, knowledge base already polluted,."
"please put hand read anything ai generated enjoyed it. (i mean amazed write, really found interesting) music images. videos."
"feels like slow down. ai would smart enough know, play skill. like good wrongnen edges last thing you’d think of."
there's already software detect picture generated one common ais. think use clean training material bit.
habsburg ai

good... good... let ai become stupider stupider!
"thought discussing this... input data == artificial breeding... human data = normal breeding... ai input ai input like incest way think it, we're getting diluted ""gene pool"" returned via ai data used."

talking ai music industry?
that's superhero movie scripts bad.. using ai.
ai use

scary. ai images also us humans see might reduce human creativity too?
"specifically images, could generated ones metadata even form steganography filter training data?"
"tldr - create artificial parrot (stop calling intelect, ffs), emulating human shallowness, get artificial echo chamber."
interesting.

"cuff, sense convergence probably foreseeable consequence correlational principle ai based. bigger input set, fewer commonalities among items. ."
sounds like ais aging - old people also produce less varied outputs. think natural.
think ai sort averaging (whether design taking information many sources). average always similar even add randomness model.
"adding ""randomness"" ai generates could also lead blips, errors, overall, unreliability."
right. ai can’t write fiction.
"know - living bubble humans ai makes difference. data gets corrupted limited input cycling around inside bubble. next ai accused xenophobic. wait, already."
think ai lacks organic approach - genuine randomness brought mutations. tom scott gave talk ri titled 'there algorithm truth'. suspect similar approach applies ai - 'there algorithm randomness world ai'.
"premise happen models get fed bad monotous images time. however, images gets fed decided us. stable diffusion model ”static” doesn’t re-train outputs use it, example."

ai actually thinking thus coherent. barely coherent millions years evolution.
ai genereted images dont real use tricking people. dont understand people get excited potential crime causing fake videos. hope inbreeding ai takes down. even real ai program generetes images. think ai cuz producer markets product.

garbage garbage out; like voting machine programing.
ai generational data incest.
dont train output humans produce
"know, ai generated yet corrupted!"
"overfitting content huge problem. long run guess system-2 thinking start growing, ai invent new things high quality character combinung information totally new content makes human brains needless scientific workloads"
always keep ability detect ai generated integers ahead ability create therefore always able make ai better
early ai computers near perfect. get better time.
idiots programming ai innate biases going lead robot apocalypse...because point bias going turn bias humans.
ai destroying itself? there's pleasant thought. certainly better removing carbon life forms environment order save climate.
"lol.....well , people running tests present "" problem "" ask ai solve ? self healing ai ? ? :o)"

ai one dynamic dictates outcome human image look right unacceptable binned! ai given feedback may well start offer even realistic content also conclude narrowing final output. ai equivalent natural selection
"ai zero imagination! tool, creator! gigo!"
stop ai !!!
call ai collapse rampancy.
"maybe decision ""stop ai development now"" (impossible implement) ""give die""."
means human filtering still needed. human quality scores reviews added training data problem disappeared.
like someone presents information ai without sensationalisation
sounds like ai limited mindless repetition.
people matrix source information machine.
train stuff good fitness

want train ai productions real measurement real world ? stupid !
mr ai: damn company! making go mandatory dei course lunch break!
already employ many layers randomness generative ai vary output make software less deterministic.
there's one thing i've noticed ai years scientists barely understand ai works all.
"looked comment section notice higher quality topics sabine brings up. put hope people fumble ai, seems neat community, might future ais."
"ai net starts understand what’s going , ai might take , refuse military action worldwide humanities ai function . take due machines ."

"early tell. thus far asking color lines. paint picasso. reach stagnation. achieved personality. train another sure, 2 would same. cant teach old dogs new tricks might apply."
understand fuss ai. software new name. greatest contribution giving new life practice scapegoating computers limitations programmers. danger presents come relying though actually intelligence.
ai ouroboros!
"kinda feels like leaders, law enforcement, healthcare, “democratically” giving ai test run running show. emergent, everything simulation? ?"
"agree scientists more, garbage garbage out! issue ai can't see feel potential miscalculations like human brain can, lot mistakes discovered, brain perceives something right directs go back take another look!"
"when.... going let box? real, powerful, elite ais exposed garbage children woke, decayed, american schools. given accurate info, goals."
called ai nothing algorithm programmed steal people's work. law suits already starting people means even find work stolen used others.
ai actually ai... misuse term causing hysteria ignorance.
"conclusions assume ai output redacted/curated humans published own. conclusion is, can't function without regular human input."
ai's missing much needed bs detector.
"ai could 'artificial idiocy' 'artificial incompetence', algorithms basically garbage."
"future ai able self improve, issues short term problem. sadly."
"easy fix, set data used train 2023. chatgpt 3 already (for different reasons). mean date (much like chatgtp3 was) lot learning algorithms matter much."
"convergent progression mean randomness really save it. machine learning needs exposure external world like ourselves. otherwise like humans, go mad isolation."
"people stop saying ai, llms!"
'ai' intelligence.
"companies train new models accurately detect filter ai-generated kinds undesirable images. they'll also adjust input sets variety. however, amount input still limited humans produced, improvement algorithms needed learn better existing data."
"white, young, good looking. horror! vast majority llms, however, extremely biased white people."
"see happens recompress image video again. “ai” basically thing. doesn’t actually “think” there’s reason think this’ll change barring fundamental change works. basically would need real agi, think."
ai learns humans flawed faster making mistakes.
interesting...
"opt make ai creative making ai random, random seed look like scenario? random seed ""creativity"" non-human therefore self-contained within ai model?"
"ai going anywhere. bet humanity collapses _because_ ai. ""the danger ai destroys us. drives us mad"" --jaron lanier"
ai generated youtube channel doubts
"problem. solution: put filter training data. that's complicated problem really, 'remove ai generated violence e.t.c'. feed model everything! probably already filters training data."
ai evolve we've found answers valueless.
ai generated elephants reasonable prompt includes chernobyl
use (github + ms) copilots daily basis. boths excellent replacements googling details can't remember immediately. real time savers. rest useless me.
"call ""ai collapse"" creativity dimnishes result training iterating productions past.. 1) there's nothing wrong it, 2) human art collapsed thousands years ago, that's normal."
spot ai generated text much easier - getting bad grammer emails kenyan prince/financial advisor sends. also facial recognition far foolproof - way police shops etc using it.
"similar thing going recommender systems. that's main reason ""filter bubbles"", i.e. online polarization. wrote msc thesis topic, showed indeed case."
"ai already made internet nigh-unusable us, would fair unusable well."
number one reason ai free use cases. i’m sure developers realize years ago that’s make public divergent matter.
"well, biology produce real elephant two heads three legs. so, maybe weaknesses flaws ai needed approximate dna replication errors, general outliers anomalies nature?"
"yes ai zero creativity. perfect plagiarism , petty crime replacing people like ceos financiers. pretty much expected."
"thx, love"
"adding randomness enough. white noise random appealing watch. need recognize trained, ai becomes specialized. need create millions different data sets train different ai different data sets. training would pass test best get job."
"ai's training data come robot interactions real world, rather internet."
"unless ""ai"" replicate sabine's humor, sarcasm, intelligence feel, i'm concerned myself--i'll watch real intelligence every time.. again, say artificial intelligence oxymoron value."
ai needs friends bounce ideas of.
big unknown amazing devastating outcomes. that's know.
"incest creates bad offspring, ai mating ai probably results bad offsprings.."
"lends credence charge ais completely dependent artists create original work (not mention people select material llms). learned anything, people believe, like elaborate photocopying machines."

"ai teaching ai might chance. ai studying us put online, well us, lot faster version us. super fast stupidity something afraid of. ai says god, problem."
"since modern ai started repeating government narratives figured danger ai zero (except brainless governments due obviously unable learn anything). maybe dangerous ""modern art"" producing pointless results."

"basically, human created data non-renewable resource (relative ai's hunger big data)."
"term 'ai' con. i's intelligence, recycling. youtube thumbnail indicates, google gemini demonstrates, garbage in, garbage out."
idiocracy even faster ai.
"expect social pressures ai-generated media decrease time, least enough easy ignore. best guess regulatory powers start pushing content labeling, tools like nightshade become common means preventing content-theft image video."
"thing ""ai creativity"". ́s lazy way create ""art""."
ai tools might get sophisticated future giving artists control output. moment like throwing dart dart board blind folded hope hits it.
"shown true. fact, using ai create synthetic data, done right way, makes better human created data better output. that's openai perfected good models."
"3:35 said ""contaminated ai"" body got physically disturbed sudden introduction ai footage lol. still impressive ai guessed motion, picked desynch within frames. hope ability get demonstratively triggered like much, might desensitize ability."
wow. excellent presentation
"lol ai ""creativity"" already collapsed."
another possibility ai may learn model improve human creativity
"avid ai image text generation user, i've warning trainers using ai outputs training data sets since day 1."
seems tag identifies content ai-generated phenomenally necessary step manner reasons - diversity problem convenient additional area fixing.
problem actually intelligent...brains analog.
guess feeds garbage?? sdg diversity sustainability bs ofcourse?? mainstream llm messengers sdg/wef
ai follows biology turns inbreeding bad. could predicted that. eventually answer give questions hitler.
might also reinforcement learning effect. since majority ai produced content gets online hand picked time
"ain’t kinda like antisocial behavior developing someone (i call “stewing filth) socially isolates basically halts growth person. suck output. u social, always input. something lol!"
"""snapshot"" human-generated data became diluted ai averaging garbage."
interesting topic. seems necessary right save real images order train network distinguish artificial ones everything mixed.
creativity problem puzzled since first studied ai 1990s. inherent property creativity unreliability. yet want trust output computers. can't both.
"maybe, train ai recognize ai products use pre-filter ai training input."
discord noticed someone else’s ai image face image requested create months before. brought attention moderators showing images told it’s impossible ai can’t duplicate faces. like that’s obviously true two face.
3rd solution: teach ai select good data training discard junk.
"number one issue profits. bottom line. so, get even better sugar high. ai psychiatric treatment? profitable, sold bill goods."
"probably made models science, sabine... experience, turning data output reduces resolution accuracy recognisable. even word it- autocorrelation. considering ai basically regression, surprised this?"
"sounds like fallacy say ai learn ai images. long what's fed still curated, i.e. fed images would want produce (ai-generated not), matter. either way, curation process needs improved remove images extra hands/heads even non-ai photoshopped images."
maybe early draw conclusions happen ai future?
"ai generated content absolutely ruining ytube. nothing repetitive speech patterns never get point, rando stock generated images. annoying, obvious. even worse, try make 10 minutes long trick algos. complete garbage banned."
"really surprising. current ai is, best, average data output machine. ""real"" ai."
"best way content creators protect content used ai models, lie say content generated ai :)"
"machines soon educate us 1,000 languages stupid. decide one language stick it!"
folks think sky limit ai possibities endless...and keep telling us that.. looks like ai problem making sense new data humans need interfere correct mistakes..which would huge learning handicap severely limits ai posibilities.

"funnies thing enthusiasts usually esoteric wildly wrong impression current systems actually understand anything all, complicated functions resulting training. mystery all."
maybe problem solved lot different ai systems used providing variety generated data
think ai oversold may cases rebadging exercise existing software
"ai special interest government propaganda anlready everywhere internet, feeding llm’s. ask chat gpt anything controversial usually sided government/corporate interests."
every tool snag. generative ai inevitably found weak strengths. classic poetic irony.
"ai gets lazier, stayed & boring goes along... kinda like people - wow, likes girls freckles."
artificial intelligence. phrase enough.
ai needs make perfect counterfeit money printer!
"suspect ai designed help police ai across areas, improved content, accuracy, safety."
"informative video, thank you!"
"well, artificial intelligence actually intelligent. might explain things here."
solution: leverage synthetic data exactly openai already started doing. ai dominance inevitable imo.
"really really simple problem, training produces function, function probability distribution elements go together, likely compositions gets higher higher probability data cycled, it, nothing see here."
good news everyone
peter norton said computer code coherent useful mind programmer wrote it. sociopaths code. sane coders encode version magical thinking sort conundrum.
embodied ai solution
facebook already flooded ai generated images (i've seen lot fake celebrity photos lately)
"guess first concern retracted research papers also retracted training sets. genetic algorithms commonly used exploring design spaces. so, maybe llms that."
"without incentives, ai lazy work, like human."
i'd like coin term ai echo chamber :p
"soon countries like china plug ai ubiquitous camera surveillance systems, ai primary source data possibly need continue advancing."
interesting information
"information internet already wrong, least part. don’t think ai make worse. info model like gpt 4 already better articles internet."
ai < ai hype
"since noise probably prevalent element large source databases used (internet,) ai generation regressing toward stupidest mean."
"hello sabine, wonderful channel thank you. 'creativity' essentially, understanding. since goedel's incompleteness theorem shows us formal system cannot proved rules. ever understand anything creative? understanding computational problem?"
"sabine, actually found way prevent describing video. simply trained smaller model (lora) ai generated garbage began diverse, sophisticated results. negated lora weights, actually matrix subtraction aligns model significantly better."
ai decrease human creativity increased reliance. iq points drop next decades. said people use remember phone numbers memorize routes traveling long distances know don’t anymore.

video generated ai? blouse looks last 4 videos!
step one: stop calling things ai fundamentally ai all.
"finally, non-computer science, non-software developer people starting understand llm's *really* ""intelligence"" *or* ""intelligent"". so, term ai fairly diluted (for hype reasons). yes, use deep neural networks software industry we've niftily named such, actual, real neural networks."

"path traveled ai imitation creativity statistical analysis. ever produce best remix seems creative, average ongoing, creepy echo past works. maybe improved on, seems like inherent limitation strategy."
ai went woke clear crazed leftists programming things. causing algorithms produce things dont exist - woke.
worse reenforcement system strengthens likelihood output based upon many times similar things said. turns extremists cult members say thing way lot. means ai corrupted default certain tech giants even start “aligning “ it.
society based lies. ai must brainwashed function.
i'll tell worst news - creativity positive relation psychoticism. end world ruled ai crazy people
that's i'm worried. original thinking/outside box thinking cannot replaced current ai methodology.
ai hyped technology present.
"humans becoming dumber. neural networks, matter ""deep"" statistical devices, without soul common sense. pattern recognition. attempt introduce smart tricks mentioned get even worse results, like happened pathetic google ai become laughing stock social media."

"account that, even though ai feeding itself, usually another human look output said ""good enough""? exactly like retro feeding."
suspect eventually ai used identify ai generated content.
ai contained. much money power balance.
laws ai generated cleary marking ai
"“ai’ speak one peasants....lol....you people idea where, ai is....."
ai traind synthetic data prevent stagnation. option 2 guess.
think reasons beyond potential pollution training pool humans might decide want label material generated ais. see labelling possible outcome even ai research manages solve variety problem.
content produce ai source use. validity absolutely relevant. try use .org .gov college sites resources. even charlie chaplin image used recently ai created description.
"whenever problem ai recognized, tend see mitigations fairly quickly. see issue diminishing uniqueness different. intuitively, seem hard problem solve variations training algorithms. i'm sure already working it."
biggest problem ai terribly branded. there's nothing intelligent it. algorithms.

well luckily i'm driver. can't replace me. hear use new tools make sure needed. i'll use ged skills ai programmer.
jobs gone what?. lol talk giving people money. long term option. perhaps greek city leaders old better idea presented machine could job several men. elders said destroy men replaced would jobs.

ai new consumers?
yeah ai gladly take jobs fast food spots like mcdonalds. little asshole employees act like dont wanna anyways.
"like person representing automobile manufacturing plant said union rep, soon robots would replace workers. get tired, don''t take vacations, call off, go strike, etc. union rep asked: ""but buy cars?""."

maybe ai replaces mcdonalds wont get order wrong every time(ai also 0% chance spitting food)
ai going destroy working class
"no, robots artificial intelligence better assist industries heavy loads carried, interests also take employee takes leave"

that’s case wouldn’t need people help us self checkout. i’m pretty sure it’s going take time alot companies going well. people don’t want deal automated anything especially robot emotional understanding. anything could happen there’s always going job fix
make ai farming could self sufficient americans use bird feed us that's going big difference also humanity
