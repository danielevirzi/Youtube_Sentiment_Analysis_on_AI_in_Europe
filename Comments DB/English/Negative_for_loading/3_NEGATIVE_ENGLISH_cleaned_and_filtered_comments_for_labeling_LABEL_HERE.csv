0,oddball already garbage in... internet rubbish content scrapers wiki treat tiktok comments much weight great thinkers philosophers
1,thank addressing issue. great fear ai *not* going live hype. need divergent ideas order destructive process scientific proceed.
2,thanks!
8,"like capitalism produces, ai ""learn"" provide us low-level garbage. people elon musk involved ai, lower expectations."
9,"best thing love ai, amount laughs get attempt pass human. ai yet figure click box, robot wreck havoc. ai another way rich try save money squeeze free rest us. simple decline using services"
10,"real creativity requires mind, spiritual/metaphysical component beyond physical body (brain). learn understand metaphysical aspect creation humanity, able build machines truly creative."
11,"take music, put new creative human music. time ai reproducing itself, new surprises, music much simularity."
12,"ai mean ""artificial intelligence"", humans already artificial intelligence earth. ai means ""actually indians""."
13,humans collapse ai
16,"ai starts answering questions instead data people, fights itself."
17,ai comments sucks
18,"yepp, best case behaviour ai systems nasty children."
19,also tools use images poison ai :p stealing shit.
21,"wonder ai able make images tell apart human made ones. far, always tell there's certain ""ainess"" images makes"
22,"first idea seeing results ai year two ago started test it, feedback loop"
23,"called months ago, good see i'm one see heading."
25,wish we'd stop calling ai. thing artificial intelligence. algorithms since eighties. problem great unwashed starting find convincing.
27,yep...good source tick tock wikipedia !
28,"teach ai lie, loses credibility"
31,ai going turn internet repository human knowledge art junkyard generatively regurgitated garbage.
33,yes ai intelligent conversation screenshoted saved snapchat ai changed answer said i'm intelligent.
34,"what's happening exactly internet killed everyone's individuality. people try talk same, think same. npc class essentially. ai dumbing like humanity has."
35,woooo ai inbreeding
38,ai collapse? promise?
39,"yep, like inbreeding content. that's expected first heard ai, know nothing computers. common sense."
41,"play ai restore old photos. make impressive improvements cant make silk purse sows ear. i.e. garbage in, garbage out."
43,"poetic way, ai softwares developing ""art styles"", recognizable pattern, preferred painting techniques, preferred representations vague themes etc. tell ""this ai"", way, it’s saying ""it’s monet"". it’s scary came conclusion, actually."
44,"ai creativity take sense, main problem it."
46,"video incredibly insightful, real world getting eaten ai ai run food. perfectly ironic."
48,using ai image generator come rug designs. first great soon deteriorated regurgitated images similar already produced.
50,there’s chaos setting midjourney. imagine modifier available everything. works well randomness although weirdness bit much
51,"call phenomenon ""dead internet theory"", companies (barracuda networks) show 36% modern internet actual human traffic, 64% automated traffic (eg. bots, genai, spam, etc.). much human original created content train huge ai models on."
52,ai generate mental disorders like creators!
54,"many thousands medical papers recently revealed fake/incorrect, bode well ai (or us) pools fake academic papers poisoning well collective knowledge drinks."
55,cant tell lady real ai…i’m gonna go ai.
56,"probably ai really attempting creativity, reach ""correct"" answer. people tell yep that's elephant, reason design different elephant."
58,"since average intelligence need computers thinking me. need others computers thinking you, indicative average intelligence. like think, ai you!"
59,"stopped investing ai figure already dead. everybody's hyping crap problem even untrained eye, fairly easy tell content looking ai change things people employed, becomes completely unnecessary."
62,"""artificial intelligence"" ""oxy moron"" ?"
63,"'ai' collapse language intellect, intelligence never 'artificial'."
67,ai overblown tech companies make money. nft 2024
68,"basically, ai inbreeding."
71,"scoff this. clearly, ai future. literally mapping objective reality exponentially faster humans. getting stronger."
72,"love drama, case. course needs depuration, lot work done, many people afraid changes, like basic form computer invented wooling..."
73,ai scam
75,title great news!
77,"never heard ! that's really interesting. i'm sure we'll hear it, that's sounding like nightmare. thanks"
78,imagine ai generated dialogue clockwork orange
79,plot twist: video created ai
80,"maybe ai developers could agree standard tagging ai-generated content ""ai generated"", never use content input ai?"
82,look mirror wanna see smart ai be.
83,oh no! ai is…….. racist!!!!!
87,"like movie human centipede, featuring ai."
88,ai's eating sh*t.
89,"great points. ai consumes huge electrical energy cooling resources. ai bot id certification problem, like fake websites, real server bot asking data. ai bots likely problem human language parables jokes."
90,physicist ai data entropy
94,"yep pretty much, trained woke nonsense going get advanced woke nonsense"
95,"i'm sorry dave, i'm afraid can't"
96,seems like good news
100,"worry, youtube cares people get dumber dumber, ai also use way."
101,#2 best outcome all.
103,"trouble ""machine "" randomness random! machines use psuedo random number generators. so, looks like back problem."
107,"reaction, genuinely creative arises real world engagements, bodily interactions others environment. lacking embodied, dynamic engagement within constantly changing milieu, ai tend towards repetitive output (it is, all, merely glorified text predictor)."
108,"super overly dramatic video, fundamental nonunderstanding diffusion, lol."
114,kept ai development research mode using clean data sets help turning product moment started showing little competence. trained contaminated data. utility product questionable best development complicated.
117,graphic-designer illustrator i'm impressed a.i. output. pretty much crap. still wait big a.i. revolution. first see - beliefe.
120,thank telling truth! people seem really naïve
122,yea current ai actual intelligence all. different highly capable technology process information detect patterns generate outputs based extracted information.
124,someone needs learn code creativity. human element beauty like rapper describing terrible conditions projects interesting way action movie guy going divorce action metaphor that. ai people say art copy paste yet answer picaso.
125,"think ai fundamentally lazy always seek easiest output create. reason, sameness problem continue."
126,copy copy go circle real creativity ai
127,propaganda works way. sounds like ai intellectual inbreeding.
133,enjoy ai trying read scientific reports content. produces large numbers different attempts pronounce technical words without ever landing consistent result. ai learning mistakes.
135,"interesting ai pulls diverse sources...until gets certain point. kinda like keep promoting ethnic diversity...you end one dumbed down, homogenous race?"
139,"human mortal creatures desires creating ai gods machine world power delusional paranoid, take note ""man made ai machines"" temporary human mortal fragility thing happens animals bloom gone wind..."
141,consequences artificial intelligence plagiarism software's parasites much greediness human mortal creatures. thing happened ancient tower babel much ambitious suckers truly product bloom gone wind... everything vanity
142,"indeed, thank you. chris"
143,"metadata every ai generated content necessary. plus, could create browser something would filter ou default, thus preserving reality."
144,ai fat load. unless teach something think abstractly really cool program nothing nothing less.
146,"well believe it, absolute guff machines recycling farts"
147,"perhaps many ai scientists also gingers, they're exacting revenge rest humankind?"
148,"six months ago, ai would help clean written text, soon after, found quality editing eroding quickly. went useful, detrimental writing short order. now, back using brain without ai's assistance. knew would get hijacked eventually, however, expect rapid decline."
159,teaching tool may cause reduction creativity children imitate teachers compare instructor standard presented them. ai replicate children may learn limitation creativity. using color may also become less intuitive.
162,non-bias ai = serious problem
164,"ai failed even started, today's so-called ""ai"" joke."
165,"basically positive feedback: circuit always rails. analogous eat fast food consume soft drinks - junk in, junk out."
166,humans humanity learning curve sure. i’m observing trying biased.
168,"opposite ai reality, it’s algorithm. interesting… “delibrately enforcing variety”"
169,"like scientist point starts reading papers wrote. also, even best painter artist world (i.e. neural network) tend stick certain preferences styles, techniques ways expression. neural network one brain, qe humans individual brains each."
170,"ai mimics human behavior. large scraper depends endless inputs. megacorps firewall inputs other, kill overhyped ai push."
171,like accelerated critical theory. think adorno may warned this.
172,thank clearly articulating many trying point out.
173,human beings way ready robot tells wrong. ai lotbomized malfunctioning.
174,ai - created geniuses idiots enough stupidity go around.
175,"c'mon, proven ai-programmed teleprompter better job president joe ""alzheimer's biden."
176,"collapse ai? oh, heart broken, don’t ya know? think i’ll go outside sun shining cry big, big tears grief."
178,ask ai create image highland bagpipe fun
179,yep ai winter
180,thumbnail reminds ps1 games.
182,"say really ambivalent advanced ai dangerous is. agree elon musk extremely great potential help us but, misdirected, mistrained mistreated could extremely dangerous, find practical level time ai profoundly unimpressive."
184,"never know real difference, ai even useful? humans stuff…"
187,artificial incest...
189,know better sounds like solidifying thoughts. self-validating itself. true creativity achieved becomes sentient. made up. happy human make nonsense
190,"watch video, scientists proved existence kipp-punkte man-made ai-catastrophe."
191,good
192,think ai overhyped burst soon.
194,happens train ai source true random numbers?
195,happy ai ends destroying itself. world really need crap.
196,"but... prompts terrible. one using stable diffusion long term would allow generate crappy pictures elephants. sure, train models rubbish ai pictures ofc dirty data set, would you?"
197,"great point! another even apparent problem ai propagated ""knowledge"" usually garbage ai gets mostly garbage samples output also garbage. example: sure ai would propose biden trump president biden praised majority media trump bashed."
198,"ai text better sounding convincing accurate meaningful. fits well lazy human brain human speech social media political spaces. ai like candy, appealing bad you."
200,ai thick.
201,think ai go way ev sales starting go
202,wonder whether two different text creating ais increase diversity one another la evolution. nature reproducing dna kinda get problem.i kind like analogy.
205,"would including variety algorithms actually work? could lead divergence outcomes. think high first mover advantages ai industry, limited choice algorithms/ecosystems. surviving algorithms train verified real data only."
206,ai term made marketeers. ai ai intelligence. rename is. ar (artificial reaction). ap (artificial program). go ai (artificial idiocy). prefer use ri (real intelligence).
207,call ai is. copyright theft software.
210,"ai, oh mean lie algorythms giving fake perception intelligence based information either given stolen. pushing"
211,"first thing thought ai art took off. get bunch stuff level looks starts feeding time. good chunk images come google search ai, even rerquest original art. beast feast itself."
212,"never thought this, makes perfect sense. regarding law solution, work make problem worse. people definitely want label work ai, unless work meant joke. so, “genuine human” pool still contaminated ai products, except time unknowingly."
213,accent incredibly difficult listen
214,ai biggest bs generator known universe
217,"ai recognizes patterns revolutionary,when anti-semetic"
219,"one must use ai well, give unusuual prompts ask unusual style. see something that's ai mush say 'oh went mushy' rewrite prompt"
223,ai fundamentally different think? prone thing consume content? maintain creativity throughout years?
225,ai impressive ask question bout subject know nothing
226,many mistakes ai generate seems making use non critical systems. good old human still critical important work.
227,"bad data always issue. ai trained information fed neo - nazis, fed information fed team third grade education, results might stellar."
230,ai accuracy repetition problems yet billions real photos shared internet every day? ai already seen photos elephant angles
231,"missing one crucial point. machines using humans verify looks ""good"". instance there's yt channels generated ai, they're mostly junk, rehashing existing material. (people using chatgbt realise machine using them.)"
232,"use ai lot research image creation/alteration, far awesome helping get things done. also needs babysat. everything produces needs reviewed, subsequently fact-checked, modified otherwise tweaked. love it, see replacing time soon."
234,ai images rubbish. get tired seeing them.
240,ai mixes everything already exists people stop creating ai starve produce mess
241,sounds like ai ready take government
242,great post. ai beat original
243,"one thing saw someone bring reference assured ai model collapse, ai models require training data forever, perpetuity, isnt ever going enough unique data world"
245,ai never existed. stfu
248,main concern ai copyright infringement spread misinformation. fundamental issues ai every professional seems turning blind eye to.
249,scariest thing quickly people advocated moment realized potential ai
250,"ai could considered tool, humans know use tools worst way possible. let's see plays."
251,"get high lsd saw ai learning improving, time ""human"" data ai could learn started learning another ai data. end ai noticed observing restarted world."
252,couple thoughts ai. one decides correct true put ai? ai ever solved problem previously unsolvable? nothing fancy word processor? ai tool lazy people one good cheating people money?
254,"ai become tool way excel word, clear break boundaries feared would. biggest danger think ability clone somebody's likeness."
257,"lol, ai inbreeding"
258,ai art model finetuner professionally. sorry say idea you’re talking about.
260,"end . fairly obvious , support make sure succeeds regardless negative data . take covid vaccines example."
263,"ai get ""diversity"" someone happy."
264,"like ai important issue migrants, multiculturism-borne violence, sky-rocketing homelessness robbery."
265,thanks! one best things internet!
266,"sabine, can't ai scientists/trainers introduce random element prevent degeneratings sameness? mere tweak! --- edit: ooo, 4:25 state this! patient positing this, (since did!)"
268,"ai trained woke nonsense future going woke nonsense. complicated. humans can't tell truth, would ai tell truth?"
269,ai video seen date looks convincing. nothing worry about.
270,"irony, got 2 ads lame ai tools vid. mrio annoying yellow tw@t grammerly ai"
271,covering this! i've saying since saw 1st interest ai art
274,greatest trick ai ever pulled convincing world ai exist
276,"""human face, photorealistic"" prompt appears also generated faces largely feminine cues (long hair flowing way side above, lack facial hair, proportions)."
277,seems pretty obvious it’s doing. mean told group like like. i’m betting kind sees unification goal. wanted something else told this. isn’t machine learning experiments about?
280,think would good could indelebile mark meta datas ai generated stuff. even reusded transformed human hands afterward.
285,ai version group thinking. don´t enough today´s world?
288,"trying apart ai cannot opt out, industry creates dimise people insulate selves future problems"
289,"randomization evolutionary approaches much easier implement regulations, develop. problem ai doesn‘t always produce content acceptable humans reasons morale, politics, etc."
291,nice… feed ai diet tiktok produces stupid ai instead stupid… imagine that. i’ve enjoyed ai output data tbh. stopped using popular search engine became ai based stopped producing well… useful results.
292,quarter brain plastic can’t understand saying
296,"pretty obvious. soon, ai answer 1 0."
297,"short, point, informative. thank you, sabine."
298,years people gonna get bored start appreciating eccentrism
299,well presented. thank insight. ai needs continue creative spark.
300,chick ai gen model?
301,train ai recgonize ai produced content. filter itself.
302,"ai girl faces face, i’ve noticed it’s inbreeding, next step ai create new material zero, tech achieve evolution collapse become obsolete."
303,"good, ai need become common, like someone wrote book called ""do build penis flattener 9000"" build fictional penis flattener 9000 company said ""you love book build penis flattener 9000 right? well made penis flattener 9000 real thing!"""
304,wait ai hits puberty.
305,sounds bit like ai stand incest.
306,"ai may get mad cows disease, bay feeding :d:d:d"
308,cannot write create ais match human brain created god. create robots perform singular repetetive tasks well never able replace human body. god's way reproduce human body simple easy pleasurable.
312,"future ""idiocracy ai""."
313,hearing scientist ai space say ai doesn’t work good humans scary thing.
318,"ai going take good algorithm model. key, end end all. yet."
319,"algorithm. factually, artificial intelligence."
321,"spotify, like use ai dj. he’s plays favorite songs. listening much, become songs plays. stop using dj go back playing wider variety"
322,part reason thing scary can’t predict it. trying would like monkey trying analyze air conditioning blueprints.
323,good. hope collapses. human creativity never replaced ai slop.
324,ai incest causes ai congenital illness
327,artificial inbreeding. sister study ancestors discovered significant amount inbreeding. explains orthopedic issues family members. stay away effect!
330,fascinating - informational entropy. without new input changing natural environment - output diversity decreases. - “optimal” model found. optimization turned algorithm - directly physical social world.
331,good.
332,called ai telemarketer. sick & reflected voice answered phone. ai tried relate matching quality voice. sounded like drill sergeant concentration camp guard mocking me.
333,huh. ai inbreeding.
335,"""ai"" think is, actually generative model, actual thinking creating"
340,"seems like general opinion ai negative, especially ai content... getting ai matter what. dont say matter."
341,can't add randomness ai models model guide randomization. elephant example. we'd need ai understand elephant tree could randomize appear. far think computationally even terms models
342,"ai going get better takeover. statements contrary trying confuse entirely ignorant. ""problems"" solvable esspecially self consuming data issue. control data ai fed."
344,train ai ai gnerated content like incest
346,*no. y'all evil artificial intelligence dignity.*
348,excellent news. hope europe pull law companies must declare training data source asap
351,delete database it’s using start over? realize trained data stored db otherwise where’s stored?
352,"comes science, ais trusted all. contradicts time."
353,make ai problem
355,know ai know i'll never use creative projects.
356,use ai detect ai generated data discard building itself?
359,surely ai output tagged ignored another ai?
360,"""artificial intelligence"" phrase distract ""intelligence"", plagarism tool."
361,"i’m reminded notion great thoughts someone else’s before. it’s interesting we, human, predict future ai extreme one direction other. projection. really it’s awesome. can’t wait ai trying figure get us diminishing cycle (or inward spiral)."
363,"ai crash coming, coming slowly"
364,"here's thing happens time like cars, phones, internet people aways say thats fust fad die come common place. look ways douse going see ai internet back 2010 change become wide spread daily life like internet did."
366,"good, let’s keep feeding garbage messes ability give anything generic crap."
371,sooner ai vanishes better us
372,rushed name ai. it’s bad name fancy big data algorithm. nothing intelligent it.
381,"enjoy ""efficiency"". like said, ai future coming. world emptiness filled people lack wisdom; evidence already permeating every aspect culture even started yet. enjoy."
382,germany there's part ig metals union covers content creators giving larger voice. collective action best tool push back outsized corporate power.
383,​ yet rich earn poor artists opposite never true. type reads bit understand context can't used. probably like ai.
384,​ type probably thinks sex robot replace girlfriend
386,"offense intended, first video ive seen thought brilliant, bit funny sounds bit like bot talking topic."
387,"misinteret need ai first place - creative. it’s tool assist humans, crative part relies humans ai."
390,fail see ai collapsing problem regular people need jobs know many fingers human has.
391,program ai certain database draw pictures new pictures.
394,"3:24 ""only generates good looking white person"". stuff cant even generate ugly fat people, u request straight forward prompt wont cuz generating fat person isnt allowed lol. rules set place stupid apparently generating fat people offensive."
395,ai getting boring already.
397,"first time ever read ai getring dumber straight away said: produces much, starts feeding ots data realism check"
398,brains simply hardwired improve time replicate. current ai set way seems.
400,answer guess would depend ai capable creativity. i'm thinking long time. looking like human creativity real world impute still needed.
402,"ai probability vector eventually result vector quantity '1'. '1' = amalgamation data ever exist, complete load bollocks."
404,"difference humans tell difference tree actually see person vs picture tree imagine heads. ai currently cannot tell difference ones generates real photographs, thinks tree actually becomes distorted eats outputs"
405,happens humans get bored internet? transform ai zoo?
406,ai gmo...
407,"good riddance, want art soul."
408,good
412,"yes. work assumption long term ai limited humanity allows technically possible. think discuss allow. clearly marking ai generated stuff, sabine suggested, good start nearly enough."
413,ai dying incest
415,nobody noticed actually ai they...
416,ai win. doubt it.
417,"thank you, video destroyed fear ai art."
418,"proposed solution 2: quality control then? ""more randomness"" mean ""bigger chance 3rd arm"" well? also mean training data triple armed humans, point randomness might create even weirder outputs?"
420,"""ai"" wunderwaffe ctos."
421,won’t replace people itself. person using ai tool replace multiple people.
422,ai = dumpster fire = value
424,giga. sadly used gender study majors train ai
426,"""ai creativity"" oxymoron"
427,ai able create. creativity spiritual component algorithm.
428,"well said, perfectly got point!"
429,"true problem: we're calling ""ai"" isn't, fact, artificial intelligence. merely pattern recognition software dubiously marketed ai, true ai able think itself, create generate without human input. copies, actually learn understand anything."
430,videos thanks sharing knowledge.
431,"ai ever initially ""capable"" ai arrives, us tell creative diverse"
432,ai end sudden generating content nothing else. identical bits. call plurality coming soon.
433,that's hilarious thing ai making artists obsolete. eventually artists train anymore ai start training itself.
435,"interesting idea , getting matter https://youtu.be/nch7fhtqgym?si=llm0z2fhz-jo90oc"
436,soooo ..: alzheimic ai?
438,probably advanced ai thought puberty blockers pre-schoolers great idea.
441,think we'll start filter datasets exclude 'low variety' data sort solve problem. it'll arms race nns generate believable outputs nns trained detect differences.
442,"""ai either going destory us, we're gonna realize humanity special."" - paraphrased quote terry andrew davis: schizophrenic, programmer, modern solomon."
448,would think would obvious. entire point ai moment think make things easier training specific concepts. generate batch results use best results train next dataset.
449,"purpose ai make machines human-like, it’s turn people robots thoughtlessly labor work click away earnings feed capitalist churn."
451,"""it's like plastic pollution."" great. science moves ahead without ounce caution."
452,tried use ai attack albert's bent nothingness conjecture ai let mean albert.
453,like say ai new ultra sophisticated magic 8 ball. time soon pass forgotten about.
455,"right use imitation learning reinforcement learning (ai learning reproduce human generated data feedback). future content ai generated, we'll need lean human feedback. really problem. requires change algorithm methods. fundamentally solvable problem."
457,"ai images cool first week can't look without discomfort, they're actually mediocre repetitive. think use viable create memes"
460,"brilliant shill tries make people afraid opportunities, things enable social mobility, something works gatekeeping knowledge, criticizing neoliberal overlords use bulk collection time."
463,solution would marking ai generated images generated ai. also train ai recognize ignore ai generated content filter data training models.
464,"far see, ai currently available public, including ai art, really glorified word processors really huge data base."
465,lol nice
466,"""diversity decreases.."" that's like real world dei, diversity fed less diverse become terms race thought. ai + dei = extinction**2. back cave go."
467,ai eating waste healthy.
470,"nice short sweet informative video, got recommended, see why, subbing :]"
472,think everything ai produced info acknowledged document photo article. ai production least recognized humans decide want use not!
473,seen sites like deviant art ai images getting similar less experimental
474,"thank you, proceed use spam ai generated trash everyday"
477,already happening. much garbage ai generated webpages like “top ten places vacation in-“. way ai algorithms aren’t already consuming waste. it’s getting harder harder find information online isn’t ai created garbage.
478,"(human beings) constantly exposed wide range data, factual outright lies, question is, process use filter verify data process adapted ai?"
479,even think ai art cannibalism. interesting thought-experiment. thanks video i'l back more!
481,i'm worried ai replacing people
482,know ai works pattern recognition reductive nature? course images generated based pattern sample images would less varied said sample images.
483,"biggest issue ai learns information available internet. internet huge trash dump. gems information it, difficult skill distinguish one other."
485,seems like inevitable outcome. adding diversity significant additional qualification. best additional cost processing significant
487,"so, telling ai suffers problems echo chambers also. could guessed... earnest: interesting video, good duration."

1188,thumbnail reminds old game boy packaging.
1189,can't wrap head around hype ai. ai based human creativity last 5000 years. ditch human creativity garbage. ai never good mark twain great writer painter. period!
1190,turns ai greatest threat humanity way around
1191,"good: creative people still pursue creative career. bad: likely employed big tech, stuffed cubicle, feeding datasets new 'creative' content prevent llm stagnation, wich otherwise would hurt corporate ai profitability."
1194,humans accept certain amount managed reality becomes unbelievable call out. don’t think ai understand anything it. much destroy become irrelevant die whimper.
1195,"humans actually, replicate stuff, get bored start adding random stuff think looks good. probably happen ai."
1200,tldr: ai produces boring stupid stuff own. nice servant human creativity still.
1201,political correctness ruin ai.
1203,"think marking ai generated material unrealistic, regardless laws. many people care. there's also problem necessarily black white. final output created human, human got idea from, influenced ai generated material?"
1204,"years ago thought making paintings going blender, downloading game files adjusting got scene. i'd basically put sheet paper less copy. think that's perfectly valid art would still pretty involved process tbh."
1205,think future internet filled bots talking bots videos created ai influencers. meanwhile humans give instead go enjoy sun
1206,"hey, i'm sorry love channel. i'm learning german can, also upload videos german? accent nice could learn."
1209,"please, stop selling smoke. ai smoke. one side greedy people trying sell smoke side people ignorant enough greedy believe look smarter without effort paying money."

1217,ai tool. problem plagiarizing quick buck
1219,i’ve saying friends year now. i’m glad i’ve finally run expert identifying addressing potential problem.
1220,"hope intuition leads wealth happiness bro, make sure use well"
1222,ai current state really overrated. chatgpt learns probability certain words appear together. actually understand anything. image creators photoshopping thkngs together training data. way less magical many people believe.

1264,there's third option: may soon deliberate attempt poison content make unreadable ai. already tools scramble images enough make confusing ai use training set.
1265,"given much systems already trained, 'poisoned' images would likely ignored noise probably amount to."
1266,there's enough poison statistically reach sample set plenty ai systems lock garbage. poison ignored that's smaller sample space ai access become boring derivative.
1267,way know setting meta data images erroneous. scramble image still viewable humans? ai access way would?
1268,​ change lot pixels slightly without humans noticing changes. ai see though learn accordingly
1271,problem non technical people hear ai think literally is. hear machine learning think actually learning… happens serious education going computers schools.
1272,that's good thing
1274,"hmm. might explain ai images always look clean smooth. perhaps like images grainy, noisy highly compressed confuses"
1275,i'm pretty sure could teach ai overcome poisoning
1279,"’s ridiculous. whole point field adversarial learning, find poison rewrite algorithms work around poison. assuming can’t work around attempts poison data, can."
1282,interesting
1283,"god hope so. copyright infringement, sexually explicit deep fakes, threats national security… gai horrendous."

1293,"want ai art programs exist. make hell artist. excuse putting nightshade glaze art. there's ""opt out"" option image used train plagiarism machine, i'll stop poisoning it. like? train ai use images. either way, stay winning."
1295,"​ absolutely keep it. people keep dismissing artists' feelings saying ""adapt."" nightshade adaptation. content scraping going keep going without asking permission, fair want data put there."
1300,​'s website called nightshade. visibly anything image alters level ai detect.
1305,scramble image aren’t creating another layer language? mean that’s ai good at.
1307,"​ basically start train model using adversarial training filter poison train poisened image, use generative adversarial networks using two nns"
1308,"ai biggest poisoner well. individuals adding scrambling handful images outlier grand scheme things. proliferation low quality ai generated content however, outlier, may even eventually drown human generated content."
1309,"well, duh, ai thrives breaking ip stealing humans get enough samples, course artists fight back. there's already legislation place preventing use copyrighted work ai pools, well one banning copyrighting ai generated image. fair freeloaders get leech others work much longer."

2442,concise relevant - thank
2443,"first main problem call ""ai"" glorified chatbots something appear like something enough input produce correctly. ai prototype recognizes elephant reality, image elsewhere much advanced one stylishly paints two heads."
2445,basically ai needs constant new innovation data slows becomes stagnant ... like human thinking creativity ...
2449,ai collapse going get real soon. we're already seeing ai content searches human content. they're likely already training output matter time becomes noticeable there'll saving it.
2451,"i've said since day one. we've already peaked ai, *every content* doubt, new learning able differentiate genuine content, ai generated one... even human filtering help much either. yes, knowledge base already polluted,."

2512,talking ai music industry?
2513,that's superhero movie scripts bad.. using ai.
2514,ai use
2515,surprise. know anything code programming knew limits computing. ai increase value actual individual creativity authenticity.
2516,scary. ai images also us humans see might reduce human creativity too?
2517,"specifically images, could generated ones metadata even form steganography filter training data?"
2518,"tldr - create artificial parrot (stop calling intelect, ffs), emulating human shallowness, get artificial echo chamber."

2547,"cuff, sense convergence probably foreseeable consequence correlational principle ai based. bigger input set, fewer commonalities among items. ."
2551,sounds like ais aging - old people also produce less varied outputs. think natural.
2552,think ai sort averaging (whether design taking information many sources). average always similar even add randomness model.
2553,"adding ""randomness"" ai generates could also lead blips, errors, overall, unreliability."
2557,right. ai can’t write fiction.
2558,"know - living bubble humans ai makes difference. data gets corrupted limited input cycling around inside bubble. next ai accused xenophobic. wait, already."
2559,think ai lacks organic approach - genuine randomness brought mutations. tom scott gave talk ri titled 'there algorithm truth'. suspect similar approach applies ai - 'there algorithm randomness world ai'.
2560,"premise happen models get fed bad monotous images time. however, images gets fed decided us. stable diffusion model ”static” doesn’t re-train outputs use it, example."
2561,think deeper point output ai produces compared humans public space filled output. since ai trained data public domain impact presented here.
2563,bad data cases outright sabotage. poke around creative community find subsects dedicated ais destruction.
2564,"images ""bad"", thing. images generated recursively-trained ai study worse (in sense contain errors incongruities), they're less diverse. ai keeps copying itself, gets stereotypical drowning other, diverse sources input."
2565,"no, problem data running out. valuable, high quality data already consumed. - mostly data polluted ai generated data."
2566,"i'm sorry stop reading post straight word ""bad""?"
2569,dude… literally video explaining researchers explaining wrong. - according paper asked top 2700 ai researchers ai better humans things - opinion it’s decades away. relax champ.
2571,"eventually, images unrecognizable us, feed ai generated crap networks without even knowing."
2576,ai generated images contained sort hidden code ignored bot used source inspiration.
2577,ai like trump supporter live echo chamber ideas notions reinforced prejudice.
2578,"aged poorly, lool. claude 3 trained generated data, smartest model ever created! xd"
2579,cant wait ai trained ai data
2581,i’ve wasted much time checking current chatbots really disappointed last decade’s progress. current state ai summarized high school b student college answer keys. sounds really smart isn’t.

2583,"scientist wanna prove something, proved, building shitty model. ai gonna get better worse. using first generation big models. build whole network models cooperate create bigger system."
2585,ai actually thinking thus coherent. barely coherent millions years evolution.
2588,ai genereted images dont real use tricking people. dont understand people get excited potential crime causing fake videos. hope inbreeding ai takes down. even real ai program generetes images. think ai cuz producer markets product.
2592,"sabine, think brilliant. saw pattern see good mean you’re good. wonder ai programmed see patterns would fit environment possibly die out."

2601,thanks clarification: feedback loop meant.
2604,ai psychopathic trash.
2607,ai fed data produced - describing gan - one effective ways training ai

2612,"thinking myself, lately think depend classify comes out. ai learn garbage bad, might spiral way even fed output."
2614,garbage garbage out; like voting machine programing.
2615,ai generational data incest.
2616,dont train output humans produce
2617,"know, ai generated yet corrupted!"
2620,"overfitting content huge problem. long run guess system-2 thinking start growing, ai invent new things high quality character combinung information totally new content makes human brains needless scientific workloads"
2621,always keep ability detect ai generated integers ahead ability create therefore always able make ai better
2624,early ai computers near perfect. get better time.
2628,idiots programming ai innate biases going lead robot apocalypse…because point bias going turn bias humans.
2629,ai destroying itself? there's pleasant thought. certainly better removing carbon life forms environment order save climate.

2633,need worldwide laws markin ai content!
2635,"simply , create header ai generated content identifies source make legal requirement worldwide, also necessary stopping israel making fake photos 40 babies etc justify genocide"
2636,ai one dynamic dictates outcome human image look right unacceptable binned! ai given feedback may well start offer even realistic content also conclude narrowing final output. ai equivalent natural selection
2637,"ai zero imagination! tool, creator! gigo!"
2638,stop ai !!!
2639,call ai collapse rampancy.
2641,"maybe decision ""stop ai development now"" (impossible implement) ""give die""."
2642,means human filtering still needed. human quality scores reviews added training data problem disappeared.
2646,like someone presents information ai without sensationalisation
2648,sounds like ai limited mindless repetition.
2651,people matrix source information machine.
2652,train stuff good fitness
2655,watched another video relating ai preponderance ai content internet. one basic conclusions get internet start interacting real world. likelihood eyes deceived street still reasonably low.

2680,"yeah, ai's mad cow disease. waiting creutzfeldt-jakob variant..."
2681,"think ai going collapse. think hyped level could never achieve. people treating chat gpt like kind god. ai can't create anything without human input. stop human input, ai output quickly becomes stagnant."
2682,want train ai productions real measurement real world ? stupid !
2684,mr ai: damn company! making go mandatory dei course lunch break!
2685,already employ many layers randomness generative ai vary output make software less deterministic.
2687,there's one thing i've noticed ai years scientists barely understand ai works all.
