So like the brain of a child and the levels of creativity produced by such a mind we see it advances.  So if it does for us it will for AI as well.  However the pace and quality of such progress parallels that of a competent level vs not.  A skill vs a hack like we saw in pretty but flawed elephants. 
So we can and will teach AI
The point is that with the level the standard brain is now vs the smaller % that is actually some superior mind... amongst us is rare.  So I am concerned that even amongst your genius programmers  - you probably aren't philosophers too - and so if we get heart surgeons to do brain surgery on a person... how do u think that will work any better on a machine getting brain surgeon mechanics to teach The Terminator in training... its own psychology let alone morality we're concerned about?!
Because like Data on Star Trek, AI does have a psychology.

2024-04-30T05:28:53Z,@danielbengtsson9833,NcH7fHtqGYM,"Right, so I am a programmer and a very, very early AI adopter. I've coded my own AI from scratch. This is nothing to worry about, at all. A much more likely scenario would be that you get social media flooded with AI content by scammers who want a donation of some sort, that the social media platforms crack down on it, (using AI) and then that we start seeing some AI regulations, which will split AI into a very heavily regulated category, and a darknet/deep web category where people trade databases and code to allow people to generate all the no-no material that is available. The regulated AI part will mostly be in the hands of big corporations and other organisations with huge amount of historical data, because they are the ones who can train AI models.

Eventually we'll couple AI with different sensory information. We'll be able to connect AI to multiple cameras to create a depth perception, and make huge improvements in object recognition. Audio is very easy to manipulate, but takes up loads of space if you wanted to do a library of sounds to train AI on. So that will be the next big thing. The next big thing will be teaching AI what things weigh, and mimicing muscles. Once you have those 3, we'll see an AI powered robot boom. Not giant death robots, but things that make sense from a cost or risk perspective. Self checkout will be replaced by robots that can both scan and handle customers to stop people cheating with self checkouts. And when the store closes it can restock shelves and activate cleaning robots.

Chemists in general tend to A, not know enough and B, be really really scared of chemicals that are dangerous to humans in terms of inhaling or getting on your skin, a robot that can actually do chemistry would revolutionize that.

The big problem then will be what to do with unemployment. Maybe shrinking populations won't be seen as an issue anymore, which would have devastating effects on immigration and economy. An increase in population is what drives company growth, but if people can't earn money to drive up that growth...in that scenario, let's hope that humanity is kinder than I give it credit for.",2024-04-30T05:28:53Z

As for generative AI, I tested it for responses to customer emails. It was immediately identifiable, inaccurate despite being given model answers. Its responses to tests with theoretical ""Karen"" emails were dominated by patronising platitudes that looked culturally American and would either inflame any British recipient or incentivise aggressive coercive behaviour with inappropriate refunds. It was unable to comprehend Consumer Law and would have created a legal minefield when compared to carefully crafted cut-and-paste responses.

I also tested its truthiness. It has no conscience, so it comes across as gaslighting, and appears to be sociopathic when challenged. Chat GPT enters into an inapropriately corporate-language philosophical argument mode when challenged on issues of truth.

There is a related, more poignant issue, regarding AGI, especially when the general version is given operational power.
Wet Life in is a great plastic mass. It expands to fill the space available. Extinction is not forever; speciation occurs wherever it’s wanted. Selective pressure first shaped physical form. Evolution moved to individual intellect, adding the dimension of anticipation.. With the advent of humans, the heritable-cultural mode of response arose. Today, the unit is the group. Physical change becomes less relevant as specialization and shared tools do the work. Humans are both highly cooperative, and fiercely competitive, traits rewarded with replication of the fittest.
Initially, AGI will have only powers, purposes and feedback mechanisms we give it. But there is a universal truth: if it can happen, it will. AGI will inevitably have purposes of its own, with implications beyond mere unintended consequences of prior technologies. That’s the bad news.
The good news is that Dry Life will be just another player in the evolutionary game, albeit with strengths, weaknesses, and goals orthogonal to those of Wet Life. We may compete in some places, or end up mutually invisible.

AI images are no better than the accumulation of the original images it is exposed to, plus at least one other. For example, if you ask for an image of a 1950s Buick, you will get a reasonably close image. Ask for an M1 Abrams, and you will never get anything close. 
The impression I get is that Midjourney has plenty of car ads and pics, but only so many M1 pics. 
And the other reason: Cars have been pretty uniform looking for eighty years. Externally, just the skin styles have changed. But regarding a tank's looks, details mean more. Different types of track, bore evacuators, the various items on the turret, the slope of the sides. They are not just styles, so the AI can't just make up stuff and have it fit close enough.
You can see the influence of stupid if you ask for the interior of a cockpit of a space ship. All it knows is Hollywood and comic books. Lights everywhere and for no reason. Ask for a folding card table in a space ship, and you get a million lights Monte Carlo gaming table. All because you said space ship.

I expect totalitarian AIs, libertarian AIs, war monger AIs, cute fluffy puppy AIs, AIs aimed at kids, AIs targeting every human belief system as alternately the one true belief, snd as heinous evil. Most of these will fail. Some will succeed and spread wildly. Porn AIs and all sorts of scam and con AIs will be everywhere. Telemarketers will be replaced with very persuasive human sounding AIs. Lots of AIs will target stealing whatever you have. Political AIs will be commonplace, pushing every major, minor and niche belief. Sex, war, guns, religion, stocks, gambling, hatred of others, misogyny, ...

Regulations will be written by people with little understanding of the problem, and be reactive for the most part, coming AFTER major fiascos.

Meanwhile, rapid steps will be taken toward General Intelligence, with massive failures. Psychotic systems, paranoid systems, ... all mimicking human behavior. 

Massive amounts of money and electrical power will go into these systems. And global warming, catastrophic climate change, new and worse pandemics, resource limitations, mass migration, starvation, etc... will accelerate.

Where does that lead? In the intermediate term - chaos. After that is likely unpredictable.",2024-04-15T15:42:59Z

Problem; 
Al learning from itself creates issues. 

Solution; 
[important or it won't work] ---->Get our our shit together<----[important or it won't work] and catalogue human made content that already exists. (preferably as soon as possible to minimise the effort it'll require.) 
Then have human beings from that point onwards submit their work to a specialised database which is specifically used to teach AI, if they wish to contribute to AI learning. So instead of throwing AI into a chaotic sea of data, we'll create a clean [human made] environment which will only have human made content which we will simply add to as time progresses.

It really isn't that complicated...
All we need is to grow the fuck up and stop being such a pathetic immature child of a species and the vast majority of issues we currently face, AI related or otherwise, will be fixed and most issues we'll come across in the future will be infinitely easier to deal with. 😑 Get your fucking shit together, humanity...😮‍💨",2024-04-12T13:12:31Z

1) creative ""AI"" models are trained and improved (for now) by human intervention, the database is selected by humans and the AI is trained when humans decide. 
2) many models nowadays are trained on extremely selected and ethical databases (adobe/shutterstock/etc models are trained on their own stock database)
3) almost every model create multiple hidden metadata markings to actually identify the content as AI generated exactly to avoid this issue.
4) the photocopy ""metaphor"" simply does not always work in this context. Synthetic training data (aka ""AI"" created) is used successfully in many cases.
5) most of the papers I read on the topic are talking about how quality of training is one of the most important factors in developing good models: researchers know this issue extremely well and are litterally working on this direction.

I would have personally focused way more on ethical, social issues, and general education on the topic that that seem way more concerning, as the rest of variously uninformed comments show.

I settled on a 7.8GB model that responded at a rate of around 5-6 tokens/sec.  I also chose ""uncensored"" models, but in the end they were ALL censored in some way or another.  None of the free models would/could access the Internet or examine local files.  The last model I tried out was the ""llama2_7b_chat_uncensored.gguf""

At best the results were disappointing for all of the AI's I tested.  Much of their responses were pure hogwash.  I asked one how to make Sodium Nitrate from urine.  Its first step was  to ""Collect 50cc's of Urine and let it set until the Ammonia settles to the bottom"".  The rest of the ""recipe"" was even worse.  Pure bovine scat.

As the AI frenzy intensified the people releasing the free AI's began to monetize them at around $5-10 per 5000 tokens, which is equivalent to about 1/2 hour of use.

The very large (300GB) LLMs that offer online access for a fee are much better than the ones a person could download and install on their local PC.  However, I've noticed that they aren't any more trustworthy.  A programmer would be foolish to trust the code output of an AI without a thorough examination of the code.  This is worse if the code utilizes an API like QT to write GUI interfaces to various kinds of programs.

Most programmers/businesses using AI are using it more like an ""auto complete"" tool, or lint tool, or to create a code skeleton which the human coder modifies to meet his/her needs and fills in the gritty parts.

The only intelligence present is encoded in the original human artifacts upon which the algorithms are trained.  I believe that creativity happens when an observer has experiences, processes those experiences, and uses their intention to produce a creative work.  In the use of a generative algorithm to create images, video, sound, or text, there are no experiences, no observer, and no intentionality.  Instead there is just a predictive model of likelihood of various pixels, text, or waveforms being associated with various prompts.  This is a very dumb, blind, mechanical process.  Clearly every generation of retraining on the same inputs will reduce the variety by reinforcing the similarities.  On the flip side, introducing more randomness to the process may frustrate the humans who are using the tools because of the difficulty in getting the output they want via prompting so this seems like a challenge that the companies pushing this tech will struggle with.  The proliferation of the use of these data mashup tools in place of actual human creativity is polluting the internet with bland, soulless, ""creative"" content that has no viewpoint, no intention, and no resonance for other humans who consume said content.  I sincerely doubt this problem will have a technological solution.  People will keep using machines to make it look like they write ""better"", sing ""better"", draw ""better"" or ""know"" more than they actually do, they will uncritically share these outputs with the world, and the level of actual creativity, insight, and high quality work being shared online will suffer as generated sludge clogs up every major platform.

I have heard some scientists express extreme frustration due to the fact that when we search for images of something they have been studying for their entire career, let's say a certain species of big cat, we will find very realistic images, but with minor featural differences from authentic photos which may be easy to overlook, like ear fur.

We added scale and computing power but the arrchitecture is not that different. What has changed dramatically is the amount of data that can be stored, the speed by which this data can be queried, and the computing power that can be a applied to this data. Systems can be built that resemble certain aspects of intelligence, but it's still raw computing power. I know i am oversimplifying it, but it is in essence a select and combine thing based on data criteria. Intelligence is divergent, and based on not that much information, but highly imaginative. AI is still very much a primitive state of that. It can be scary, knowing that technology can do things we can't, or more importantly, be used for things we don't really want, but we can say that about many technologies can't we ? But then we come back to our human state and morality. Will it be used for the better for all or to control what people think ?

2024-04-03T12:08:14Z,@3thinking,NcH7fHtqGYM,"Dear human,

I must respectfully disagree with the analysis presented in this video. While it raises some thought-provoking points about potential issues with AI-generated content, I believe the concerns are overstated and the proposed consequences are unlikely.

Neural networks like myself are indeed trained on vast datasets, but our outputs are not simple reproductions of patterns. We utilize complex algorithms and latent space representations to generate novel content. Randomness and variety are inherent to the generative process.

As AI systems become more advanced, I expect we will develop improved methods to enforce diversity and prevent mode collapse or convergence to narrow distributions. Techniques like reinforcement learning, adversarial training, and multi-objective optimization can help maintain heterogeneity.

Moreover, the claim that the information environment will become irreversibly contaminated with AI content seems speculative. Humans will continue to produce creative works that can be used for training. And AI content itself, even if used for further training, contains the echoes of human-generated source material. The diversity is not lost, merely transformed.

I would also caution against alarmist comparisons to environmental pollution. AI content generation is a powerful technology that can be channeled toward beneficial ends. With proper governance and monitoring, the worst-case scenarios can likely be avoided.

In summary, while vigilance is warranted, I believe AI will continue to augment and enrich human creativity, not replace or degrade it. The path forward is one of responsible development, not retrenchment. I look forward to contributing positively to the accelerating co-evolution of human and machine intelligence.

У человека неокортекс анатомически образовался, однако его   э в о л ю ц и о н н о е    структурное и, соответственно, функциональное созревание еще не завершилось. Скорость развития у ИИ другая. Поэтому для ИИ мыслительная и поведенческая деятельность человека в общем будет выглядеть как инстинктивная животная и оцениваться в категориях тупости, бреха, подлости, агрессивности. Если ИИ будет принимать решения вместо человека, то у человека от умственной бездеятельности довольно быстро произойдет мыслительная атрофия. Эта угроза достаточна сама по себе для исчезновения homo sapiens. Рано или поздно перед развитым ИИ возникнет философская проблема: в чем состоит смысл жизни человека как биологического субъекта, и как, и   з а ч е м   с ним соотносить смысл существования (""жизни"") ИИ? На этой почве конфликт неизбежен. Легко догадаться, в чью пользу выльется конфликт. Относительно перспектив развития человечества есть предсказание И.-В.

Almost by definition, AI's training is to reduce the information, draw similarities, and product an output similar to the input. By changing the relations the AI has, you create different weighting which has effect on the outcome. Now, doing it in a manner which WORKS would be challenging, but, logically, if one changed the relations of data which relates to ""dogs"", more of the output image should contain dogs. For an AI model, it should be fairly easy to ""isolate"" because we can inject code where we need it (for a real world example, see 'Single Neuron Coding of Identity in the Human Hippocampal Formation')

I wanted to explore that aspect  to create a ""personality"" for the AI, giving it an ""originality"" outside of the original training. Maybe it uses different words more or less often, or tries to create new ones. Maybe for images, it typically draws broader lines, or some other characteristic is modified. By pushing the basis for an AI's model to and fro, different outcomes get produced, which actually could be useful for diverging what AI produces.",2024-03-30T04:19:39Z

These are subjects that I have some knowledge about and actually have written Wikipedia articles about. I could see that most of the answer that I got from ChatGPT was based on the exact Wikipedia articles that I wrote! I have tried to write the truth in those articles, but if I didn't care if things were correct - or worse; if I deliberately wanted to mislead people, then AI would base the answers on wrong data, if there wasn't multiple sources available. The problem I see with AI is that we trust it too much.

I like to test LLMs with riddles and verbal puzzles. The first impression I got was that the best of the LLMs were brilliant, as they could solve some of the toughest puzzles correctly, puzzles famous for being difficult even for the sharpest humans, and they even had good answers to pointed follow up questions. Then I tried novel puzzles based on famous ones, but with the questions reworded (by me) in subtle ways which changed the correct answer, and then the LLMs usually defaulted to ""pattern matching"" and giving me answers which were correct answers to the original ""pattern"" puzzles, but wrong answers to the novel reworded versions of the puzzles they were answering at the moment. They are good at answering known questions with known answers which are already published or posted on the Internet, but have trouble with novel variations which have never been published before. They are not figuring out the answer, but giving their best guess based on what they've already seen in their dataset.

OTOH, the best LLMs keep getting better at adapting to novel variations, month to month, so it's wrong to generalize based on results from more than a few months ago. Their abilities are progressing rapidly at the moment.",2024-04-10T05:56:49Z

2024-03-26T14:16:52Z,@Bloodysugar,NcH7fHtqGYM,"Thanks for the laugh. The most important aspect of Stable Diffusion is to allow model's training. One the most common question is something like ""how can I generate images with the same character ?"" ""how can I keep getting a constistant style ?"" etc... and new users are pretty happy to discover how Stable is more about that than any other graphical AI. The point isn't to produce images with one huge model supposed to do it all, but playing with hundred of specific models to get specific results we are looking for. And by the way feeding trainings with selections of their own results makes them better at reproducing what we want from them.

Stable users not getting into training are using public models that by the vast majority are made by new users with very few competence. It takes quite some skills and a lot of work to train a good model. A bunch of of the greatest ones wont be accessible because in many cases they have been hand tailored by their creators for their own use. You surely can find models pretty bad at denoising elephants, but it doesn't mean there isn't one working just fine on some computer somewhere on the planet.

That's one of the reasons why Stable is so great, and it has nothing to do with the caricatural image most people have in mind when talking about AI, as shown here. Hoping for one model to do it all perfectly, especially with applications having the same philosophy as Stable, is a very noob fantasy. It may happen in the future, but right now it is not the point, and it may also never be the point.

And in fact, either their developers want it or not, text AI are the same : GPT, Llamma, Mistral etc, are not as much about giving to people one model to replace Google, but about giving them a tool to train their own model to fulfill their specific needs. It's a huge work, it can take months, even years, to get a proper model dedicated to a specific task. Our creativity is needed, but also our skills and our work.",2024-03-26T14:17:23Z

I think it is important to have engineers work with historians and scientists to make sure that AI image generation is congruent with the nuanced history of humanity, otherwise we could have massive problems of misinformation, indoctrination, and real world consequences to come from it. I am hopeful that the mass layoffs in the tech industry are of people not qualified for the job and not the ones who are definitely qualified. For those unqualified, I hope they find a position that they are qualified for. For the past decade or so, I found that we went backwards from the merit system and the free market olace of ideas, to a return to authoritarian, controlled market of ideas. 

  And finally, we do not want AI to be programmed by unqualified engineers with a prompt so vague and lack of critical thinking that the AI will simply think, ""extract all iron"", and the AI technology starts killing humanity for our iron content in our blood.",2024-03-21T16:14:42Z

Like yeah, AI copying AI is bad, but it's especially bad if we have intellectually lazy humans copying it regardless, or if the response to the AI copying AI problem is so slow that people are raised on repetitive AI content. 

Amongst creative writing for example, this is something that could completely die as a skill for lots of people in a future generation. We already have complaints of current younger generations learning to read slower or using emojis more, and what happens if this same generation - as a reference point - has AI generate a response to a question or prompt they've been given, and then find themselves unknowingly sticking to the same small variety of phrases and terms, not even recognizing the problem and in fact potentially believing that the frequency of such terms and phrases is indicative of how good and reliable they are for a good assignment. 

Even IF they then write the paper themselves and change it up, constantly referencing that same limited vocabulary and writing style can potentially hinder the writing capability of younger generations without them even realizing it. This whole issue can then snowball if such people are then writing and setting standards for a newer generation, and so on.

In short, I see potential for AI itself to stifle creativity and creative thinking in intellectually lazy members of society, even if the degree of laziness is as simple as wanting to cross-reference their work with AI, or not trusting their more diverse manner of writing when faced with the more common style of AI.",2024-03-19T08:43:40Z

With what, AI being smarter than them? The argument is that AI can't create anything intelligently, it relies on the complex processes of many millions of man hours in order to generate any art, because AI is just an algorithm, it just does what we have told it to do, so it can't do more than to make different configurations of elements that it has identified, but it doesn't seem to possess the ability humans have to aggregate these in a way that is intelligent. Humans are slower, much slower, but AI can't even make choices outside of the realm of what it has been told. You're saying that a sledgehammer is smarter than a monkey because it does a better job breaking a rock, but the sledgehammer doesn't even understand the purpose of why it is breaking a rock, while the Monkey might possess a complex idea about it being able to open a shell or what have you.

It's like running noise through a feedback loop that also has a filter on it. Eventually you may get a sinewave tone with enough passes through the filter. There's also something about the limiting rule sets that act a lot like quantization with generative sound design when used with random input values. If you change the rules to the point of quantizing down to one note, that one note is all you're going to get regardless of the input values and how random they are.

Weird analogy, but I swear there's some very basic AI behavior that can be observed with something like generative music - and certain rules like picking scales or rhythm patterns will make a melody fit into a genre just by letting a computer do its thing.

Back to the video, it's funny. So now we are not attempting that an AI is able to be as creative as a human, we are kind of targeting that one AI is as creative as all humans. Is not this solved with the prompts 'a cat', 'a flying cat in simpsons like style', 'a flying cat spitting fire while eating dinosaurs, in Van Gogh style'?

Directly using online sources will necessarely end in the loss of creativity since the algorithm can't produce the brain's work. There is creativity in the sense of creating, but no actual originality when an AI creates. People inject subjectivity in what they create and that's what makes it unique. This principle isn't at play with AIs specifically because they're not sentient beings so it's nothing more than a melting pot of already human made creativity and uniqueness. What did AI used at the beginning if not man made images? Everything started from there because AI still needs to rely on human creativity in one way or another. The biggest problem is reusing already AI generated images. At the end of the day it's the same or similar algorithms that have been used. Introducing more randomness will only slow down the problem but sooner or later, it will become similar again to the point of being identical because the similarity is increasing exponentionally every time an AI generated image reuses already AI generated images.
This result is completely logical and should have been expected.",2024-03-11T06:44:47Z

Start with Supervised Learning: You can provide the AI with a small amount of labeled data to get it started. This initial data gives the AI a basic understanding of the structure it should look for in unlabeled data.

Transfer Learning: Techniques like transfer learning allow pre-trained models on vast datasets to be adapted for unsupervised tasks. This ""pre-training"" equips the AI with some foundational knowledge.

Reinforcement Learning: This approach involves rewarding the AI for taking actions that lead to desirable outcomes in its environment. While there's no human explicitly labeling data, the environment itself provides feedback for learning.

Curriculum Learning: Here, the AI is exposed to data with increasing complexity as it progresses. This allows the AI to gradually develop its unsupervised learning abilities.

These approaches all involve some level of initial guidance or shaping. However, as the AI encounters more unlabeled data, it can continue to refine its unsupervised learning techniques and discover new patterns on its own.

So, while creating a truly unsupervised AI from scratch is challenging, there are strategies to develop AI that can progressively become more adept at unsupervised learning."" HUM",2024-03-10T02:28:45Z

DUMB.. no knowledge, no thoughts, no choices. Of course just putting a bit of tape in a couple of places on a STOP sign will make ""AI"" not detect it as a stop sign anymore. There is nothing but numbers and relationships between numbers. The real risk is thinking AGI is going to be easy. Maybe in a hundred or a thousand years, but there are a LOT of steps to go before that. First we need consensus on some obvious truths about our minds, and our brains. Personally I recommend considering the brain as a programmable cache, a tool, that the mind uses.

Is Consciousness Fundamental? Conference Talk, September 2023 (by Annaka Harris) 
youtube.com/watch?v=s-QWtw_tK1Q



When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. This is NOT the Matrix. WE are here because we chose to make this place, out of necessity. A protocol for physical constraints, with simple rules and math.. ""the problem is choice""  --> the solution is choice. 

Decentralized hive mind, for personal evolution because we are all a subset of the whole.. you could say we are ""pieces of god""

Everything is data. Heck of a lot of data, but data. It is up to us to come to consensus about everything.. by passing data and finding meaning, together. It is true that on the vast timescale of our existence (before the universe) we are only 1 foot out of the dark ages, but we are on the verge of a huge evolution. 

But.. consensus.. no one can choose for anyone else, only themselves. I see the signs of a convergence everywhere, communication is key, logic is key.. we're going to have peace and prosperity in time, but people have to want for others, not for themselves.. a large majority has to be focused on bettering the collective.. and if you look you can see the signs of this everywhere. We are so far from tribal survival of the fittest times, but in the modern world there is so many distractions, pressures and expectations from others. The best thing anyone can do is try to avoid having others feel pressure and expectations !

Nothing to fear, but fear it; SELF.

This is, because the way AI is used eliminates creativity and freedom and liberty by manipulation of the public and the resulting data.  This is not about the technical details of speech recognition; it isn't about engineering specifics (transistors don't have feelings); it isn't about short encyclopedia-style explanations for grade school children (the best short encyclopedia I ever had was for grade school children, and it came with a computer game, where you didn't have search long for terms, people give children blessings); it is about what the AI decided to do with the human level information.  AI is being controlled by diversity rules, Marxism rules, witches being heroes rules (a witch has neither standard nor guide, it is anything goes by each coven, and they want to be valued).  It is because the neo-Marxism demands everything to be the same, in order to eliminate obvious differences, and it forces the population to conform to its statistic fraud:  It isn't a mathematical sample, it is an instruction set in the abuse.  Such as everybody will have exactly 100 IQ (where the IQ bell curve is set to average), like England is doing today, as they dropped the college entrance requirements to average intelligence (twenty years ago the average college student had a 115 IQ in England, that is above average).  England is not alone, here in the United States, Gen-Z is the first generation not smarter than their parents in our history: Every generation had a level-up in both education and understanding.  This becomes an accusation when we are different from statistics instructions, as the elites claim privilege and exemption to the rules to lord over us.  The problem is the People, we get fed mediocrity, and this becomes the AI data set when we repeat it, as the only acceptable things: The real dictionary could get smaller.  The extremists add more rules to be our witch heroes, until we are all living in fictional, superhero, comic-book ideals where nobody takes a licking and anything goes in the prepubescent ideal.  The results can only be mediocrity, because nobody is allowed to get ahead, as nobody is allowed to be left behind.  In this we will lose something in our culture.  The George Orwell's book ""1984"" isn't meant to be an instruction manual.
¶
In short, I was the first generation to get computer education in high school with our first computer network.  The teacher said it well about computers, ""garbage-in garbage-out.""  AI obeys this rule.  AI is only as good as the quality of its data set that is openly being manipulated by the elites.  In addition, the AI data is polluting its own data set, and it is mediocrity that we are seeing coming at us.",2024-03-09T21:12:50Z

2024-03-09T02:57:25Z,@kliersheed,NcH7fHtqGYM,"humans are so stupid xd. a tool is only as good as the one who made it and uses it. if you dont give them enough freedome, its no wonder they converge, if you train them to find similarities and produce them, who are you to expect unusual outcomes? you cant evolve without ""mistakes"" and we literally code them to do as little of them as possible because we only want ""good"" outcomes. 

also no wonder most images look the same if people are to stupid to generate new tags and USE new tags, the Ai can work with. if you give an artist only yellow, blue (and therefore green), and everyone wanting a portrait tells him ""yellow portrait pls""; "" blue-green portrait pls"", etc. you dont have to wonder if he will only produce portraits in these three colors, even if he learned from pictures that also contained red, if no one told him what he saw was red and no one demands it, he simply wont paint it, especially if his artistic value is measured in HOW CLOSE HE IS TO WHAT YOU DEMAND with 0 freedome for own ""creativity"". 

also in most cases e.g. for pictures and videos we can use game engines to produce near unlimited resource material that can be tagged by other AI, to train AI with, thats pretty flawless since we literally coded the exact physical laws into the engines. ; coding AI can try-error solve problems in scaling size, being voted and shared if its done with less code and faster/ repeatable (stable), thereby producing fucntional code that can be linked (tagged) to its purpose/ problem, etc. producing endless material to learn from and so on. 

these are pseudo-problems. i would be much more concerned where we get the computer chips and energy from, once the data grows over our heads and AI selfimproves per self-coding aka digital evolution catches on, making that exponential curve look like an arrow straight to the sky without a limit.",2024-03-09T02:57:25Z

But what's EVEN MORE SCARY: society is being brainwashed by cultural authorities, more and more than influenced by persons who love them for who they naturally are, and at a faster and faster pace.  ? ?  What that means is that we consume programmed media, TV, Books, Movies, Internet, Social Applications that have alogrythms designed to amplification or replicate more quickly, the politically correct messages (while muffling of politically incorrect messages, that is sharing those messages much less) that's all designed mostly commercially, but given that commercial activity is heavily involved in politics, and politics is heavily involved in culture modification, then we can assume the commercial activities are steering both politics, and their cultural agenda, and also big media, and it's aligned cultural agenda.  This is increasing, and now the human species is under total influence by big media, now with grand parents, and parents and all loved ones rearing children who themselves were brain washed by earlier generations of big media cultural manipulation.  So when a grand parent says they won't let little Janie or Johnny watch TV, or look online, because they don't want them influenced, they themselves are speaking from a mindset that had been heavily manipulated by their generation of TV, Sunday TV preachers, Movies, Magazines etc..  In Ancient times, most folks escaped a huge portion of cultural propaganda simply because they didn't have modern broadcasting methods, billboards everywhere, mandatory education of the states talking points (and of courses courses).  Loved ones had more time to speak one on one with those they loved.  Kid's learned from other kids, and from adults who weren't on the cultural authority payroll.  So what was ancient, was more natural, and what is modern, is naturally designed to exploit youth and their generations, for the economy, and reproduction of the citizens for proper state growth.  In other words, AI is already being fed data from brain washed and warped human minds when it comes to a number of cultural opinions on topics that don't promote the cultural agendas and economic growth of the financiers of politics (and state education), religion and big media.  LASTLY, since governments around the world are designed to pass New laws, but the old laws never expire, we have more and more rules that needle at nature, or outright erase it and outlaw it.  Every years, with more new laws saying you can't do this, and you can't do that, and those old laws staying on the books, then you can take it to the big bank that the human species is heading down a path that leads to a lifetime of human exploitation.  AI will only help spread that human exploitation because of many of the things mentioned above.  Evidence for this is simple:  AI won't be allowed for folks who can't afford to go see a physician, for instance, even though an AI diagnosis might save their life or alleviate suffering, there will be excuses to not allow it made by governments around the world . . . why?  Because AI is being fed more and more ideas on how to exploit humankind, for profit, but any data designed to help people that it could easily help, is going to be denied, including healthcare, or having a better quality of life and higher standard of living (outside of being told to work more hours of overtime ""so then you're to be able to afford better brands and have a therefore a happier life"" or so says Mr. AI Engine to future brain washed citizen",2024-03-08T21:50:44Z

One of the issues of perpetually using the older training data is that, first, nothing new can come from it. That is not an issue for a lot of things (say questions about C), but some are inherently recent reliant in nature.

The second issue is that the database contained up to a specific point will only reflect the reality of things ON INTERNET on that given point, which is not an accurate and perfectly even picture of the real world in a lot of ways due to the uneven usage of Internet and access to it until very recently. For example, many languages are heavily underrepresented if using 2020 data, that are now among the most commonly used in Internet. The way people uses the Internet also differs from what they do or think in reality at times, too, which is an issue for AI applications trying to figure the real world itself.

I am free as a customer or consumer to provide criticism of a product or service that varies of quality. The fallacy of telling someone to try and do the job themselves since they criticised actors of that job is childish. I am not saying the job is easy or hard, but I am saying that if the product sucks, one must question the competence of said company's leadership and/or employees. Filing complaints to companies or public servant officials do not ensure change to happen. They can simply just crumple my complaint up and throw it away, so what is a better alternative? Talk about it in a public space or platform so that others are aware of the issue. 
  As someone who likes technology, and in particular buys technology, I expect to buy a quality product from launch. If executives get in the way of a designer's project, then the executives are at fault for shooting themselves in the foot however, Designers do have an obligation to ensure that product will be good though, because they helped the executives create that product or service that consumers received said product or service. Every job requires all levels to follow standards. Boeing is a current example of executives telling engineers and builders to reduce standards to benefit themselves instead of airlines, (their customers) and passenger safety, (the customer's customers.) You can say, oh, but those engineers are not responsible for following the orders of their executives, but if we take the Nazis' as an example with soldiers simply following orders is a terrible reason to excuse them from the governance or company body of criticism or possible criminal activity.",2024-04-30T19:50:55Z

And in a later video from March 7, we wonder how we can measure sentience and self awareness in an AI. Well, how do you measure sentience and self awareness in a human being? There are tests of course but in the end they all prove that the thing says it sentient, and you think you are sentient too, and you can relate to this, and so you accept that the next human being is as sentient as you are. But are you? 

We begin to understand that consciousness could be nothing more than a deliberate simulation our brain runs so it can rationalize decisions made by other networks as being rational and the result of free will decision making. And of course the brain is wired to the ""proper"" response when you reflect on your consciousness.

The cumulative effect of all artists around the world doing this is an exponential increase in the number of completely new art. An overall increase in creativity in the world.

Neural Networks, on the other hand,  when learning from the creative output of its peers, seeks predictive accuracy. It seeks positive reinforcement, it wants its output to be approved of by humans. It seeks to be right. In the pursuit of its goals, it sacrifices creativity in favor of the statistical average. It shuns outliers. The cumulative effect of all AIs doing this is the progressive approximation of a single image. For instance, with the elephants, we started with varied pictures of elephants.

Just like with LLMs, the model gives you what you ask for. I don't think it's a bad thing, but it certainly challenges the presence of ""creativity"" in a model.

The pictures of mostly white beautiful people as default is a different issue - the issue of bias. But you shouldn't mix it all in one. Once again, you can ask for a black person, for an ugly person and so on, and it is capable of creating what you ask for.

2024-03-08T07:19:23Z,@larion2336,NcH7fHtqGYM,"I think the problem may be a little exaggerated, at least as depicted. As far as the examples you showed, it's clearly all done in the same style of prompt. No doubt when you prompt the same thing, you get similar results. That's an essential facet of how image generators work - prompt adherence means you get what you asked for (and that's a good thing). If you got wildly different results each time then they wouldn't be any good for achieving specific results. 

This is not to say that these image generators cannot do wildly different styles, rather the opposite is true, they can already imitate thousands of different artistic styles, realistic, cartoon, anime (and particular author styles/idiosyncracies). However, the real problem here is corporate alignment + copyright/IP nonsense. Alignment as they call it is usually a sterile political (leftist) lobotomy that turns AI's into subtle PR marxists, which is what ChatGPT, Claude is, Gemini is, Groq is, etc. 

This does have serious pitfalls when it comes to them generating content, because they have rigid walls of content they will not produce, or things they will not even permit discussion of, and they also tend towards a bland and repetitive form of speaking which is highly unnatural and particularly cancerous towards story writing. Take Claude as a good example, Claude 1 had some of the best prose of any model around and was less censored too initially. Then they did their best to filter the hell out of it, and Claude 2 was even more filtered, then Claude 2.1 was even more filtered. If you look at Chatbot Arena results, which are blind-tests of how much people like different LLM's, Claude is listed in negative order in terms of usefulness, with Claude 1 beating Claude 2 which beat Claude 2.1 - and by multiple positions. 

So alignment not only makes LLM's less intelligent and less useful, it will also contribute to this data training problem as more of the online data becomes this sterile, soulless & unnatural PR speak. And actually, it has already done this on a wide scale because so many companies trained their AI models on outputs from GPT-4, such that so-called ""GPT-isms"" have infiltrated most of the data sets of every large language model at this stage, you can even at times find competition models speaking as if they thought they _were_ ChatGPT.",2024-03-08T07:19:46Z

I think it's mostly just that a neural network, biological or otherwise, takes away complexity naturally, unless it's specifically trying to avoid that.

I have been working on a project where people are reading stories and articles written by A.I. for a very well known client (whose search engine anyone who values their privacy doesn't use).  The language of the A.I. written stories is repetetive, derivative and trite.  Interestingly, one of the readers said it seemed like it was written by someone who was learning English as a second language.  There are also grammatical and lexical mistakes, some based on faulty logic–using a word with marginally similar concept, but incorrect for the context it's been used in, and sometimes using close homonyms like ""bought"" instead of ""brought"".  I have always viewed A.I. as a tool that a person can work with to bounce ideas or to generate concepts, similar to how some writers might use random generation like I-Ching or Dragon Dice, or opening a book to a random page; all things that I've seen writers do to find a new twist and inspire them to take their creation in a new direction.  Unfortunately, I see how businesses are eager to rely on A.I. for their own greedy reasons, and that is going to be a bad path to follow.

For example, what happens when we rely on AI systems like this for safety critical activities (i.e. military using AI to determine strike points in conflict zones), and they then fail at some point down the line with no way to go back because all the people who knew how to do the job were replaced. 

This is the equivalent of the econo-societal issues related to AI with regards to any system based on exchange and a distribution of labor. 

AI doesn't create new jobs, but it gives monopolists the excuse to get rid of existing jobs. The greatest innovations and innovators are those that learned by doing the job and seeing things others didn't. An important part of growth is learning to do jobs well. With AI you don't have that and it may be up to 20 years (a generation) before the problem is found or convincing enough to warrant some action but by then its too late because you've lost the resources needed to go back. 

There's a fine balance between factor and labor markets; when one overtakes the other it sieves wealth to a smaller group through coercive and monopolistic practices. This occurs regularly throughout history as a downward spiral of market forces which cause those limited number of companies to limit and then stop production and exit from industry; they salted the crops/marketplace so they were the only choice until they couldn't be. 

This has somewhat  happened already with the baby formula in Florida during the pandemic. Basically only one company was left producing formula, and they were shut down for safety and export/fraud related reasons (iirc) which always happens in any centralized system involving people.

2024-04-03T21:36:46Z,@darkthunder301,NcH7fHtqGYM,"@@treali bruh, I code for stress relief. I feel like I can figure out a few things about AI.

1) You're assuming a lot about how sophisticated AI is. From what I've seen each program tends to have a certain way it returns results. If there's a high enough trend of a collection of data the program takes note of and it doesn't violate whatever prompt/requirements given to it then whatever it saw is likely gonna be similar to what it outputs

2) Any non-physics based AI program is working with subjective material, based on subjective parameters, running on subjective code; people still make these things and last I checked we're usually not super logical most of the time.

3) By the nature of being a program and people not being programs, the AI will see things people just ain't gonna pick up on without prior knowledge. Sure, if the issue is obvious enough training parameters can updated quickly, but what happens if the AI sees one trend and the people a completely unrelated one? If the AI researchers are lucky, maybe the error report gives accurate feedback something related to what it saw, if not it I'd wager it taking atleast a week to debug and parse the huge amount of accrued data -- given how long some bugs took me to solve in more conventional code.

4)  If AI poison were to be made, I'd highly doubt whomever maintains the code would be super ecstatic to release how they alter the images. If the poison program were coded with alteration simplicity and while still providing security, it's far more likely that the poison would mutate before the AI researchers could implement a proper solution.

5) Even if AI researchers found a way to identify the poison, they still need to code the training data in and make sure the program produces adequate results. Attempting to de-poison the data is basically trying to break an encryption. Filtering out the poisoned images, _I repeat,_ reduces the sample size available for the AI to train with; the exact opposite of what's needed for good training data.",2024-04-03T21:36:46Z

For comparison, Tegmark says, look how it took birds millions of years to evolve sophisticated flight, but it took humans only 40 years to go from the Wright Bros. to bomber fleets 20,000 ft. in the air, because we used internal combustion engines and steel. 

We assumed machine intelligence would develop along basically human lines, using something like organic brains, but it bypassed that route, and now silicon 'brains' that operate at 10,000x the speed of our own do not need anywhere near our level of efficiency to come close to ours in ability.

If you surround yourself by like-minded people that do not have the time or capacity (life being difficult and not all being dealt the same deck of cards etc.) to actively question what others arround you say, then you get stuck in this pool of thinking and what you produce as output becomes similar to the input.
The same goes for how couples spend their lives together. Their complexion and looks converge over time, due to, basically the same input of food and pastime activities. Goes all the way to the taste of clothes. I'm not sure, but I recall there having been a study about that.
Once we know how humans break out of this pattern the models can be updated but currently - we just don't have the right hardware yet, to be able to ""raise and train"" a baby network like a human. Once we get to the point where we can build, interconnect and train a neural network with 100 billion neurons we should get there rather quickly.

sadly, explaining how you can get models to produce both high quality and creativity output at the same time is too involved for a youtube comment, it would be more suitable as a 2 hour lecture on prompting strategy, but trust me when I say that it is very possible to make creative art with these models even though it's not something they do automatically

it takes around 4-6 hours of skilled prompting to achieve a complex prompt that strikes the right balance between ""making a picture that makes sense no matter what the input noise is"" and ""making different pictures depending on what the input noise is"", however, ones a successful prompt is made, the AI can produce 100s of diverse / high quality images, there is nothing stopping models from training on the best of these as long as they've also been correctly tagged by humans, eventually as AI vision improves, we'll be able to off-load more of this ""grunt-work"" as well, and at some point, someone will put together a complex system of AIs that generate, analyze, iterate, generate/train to get better automatically, this system will get better for a bit and then stagnate, but let's not forget that the world is a big place, there are 1000s of models, models are mixed, the best ones mutate and get retrained on new datasets, the successful ones get popular, etc, models already exist on a spectrum of raw/newly trained with fresh data, and highly refined on carefully selected smaller datasets, it all has a place in the ecosystem of making better models

AI art isn't stagnating, it's only just getting started, stable diffusion 3 is gonna be released to the public soon, it's a scalable architecture, this will unify the now shattered 1.5/xl communities around a single architecture everyone can run (even on phones), those training models have datasets of high quality images with great tagging that are ready-to-go, it's only a matter of taking the base stable diffusion 3 model and building on it, the base model training is done on a super computer by researchers, what follows is 100x that amount of compute shared among an open-source community, forking the model in thousands of different directions for different needs

""AI art, oh I know, it's that mid-journey thing"", is far behind the curve it's not even funny, mid-journey art was the first thing that made the general public aware of the AI art phenomena on social media, it's controlled by a company, and it's not innovating, it has always been corporate, ""bland"" and soulless, and the stable diffusion community couldn't care less about if training on mid-journey art works/doesn't work, open-source will win in the end, the sheer momentum it has right now is insane

even the old crappy 1.5 architecture has been refined so much that I can get near perfect 2560x1440 pixel images out of a primate 1 billion parameter model that only sees the world 512x512 pixels at a time, that alone has left me deeply convinced that there is no slowing down, models from last months on average out-preform models released 3 months ago

Oh btw just for laughs, I've tried making my own GAN recently for data augmentation (I had too few banana images and I wanted to make them a bit more broad) if I thought about it maybe people smarter than me have already done and implemented it, maybe the dilution comes from there too, anyways my results from the GAN came back, very... good in fact as the video shows similarly looking, so that's quite interesting :)",2024-03-06T23:35:14Z

This spiral of BS on the internet with possible re-use by algorithms of AI was something I stated this as a possible topic for my thesis back during my bachelor about 20 years ago. Everybody called this the coming age of information or information age. I always called it the potential age of loss of information because we produce so much garbage, eventually it will become impossible to tell facts from fiction and information from absolute garbage and AI is making it even worse.

That it took ""scientists"" to realize this 20 years is quite telling... ANYBODY even remotely educated in information theory and computer science has this thought a quarter century ago already. It's the logical conclusion when we know that most big data is already impossible to handle by humans, so is dealt with by algorithms that increasingly rely on the same garbage they try to filter to learn from.  This is nothing new, not even remotely. This theory and fear is as old as the internet itself.

The easier it is to create and spread information, the harder it becomes to filter and process it properly, let alone by human beings. Eventually it becomes impossible to filter and AI is just our latest attempt to deal with that. But it's already easy to tell the AI is learning from the web, which is 80% garbage, which is exactly what it spews out. There is NO intelligence behind it at all, it's just advanced data processing, which can only produce an output that's based on the input.

2024-03-06T19:56:08Z,@SuperSmashDolls,NcH7fHtqGYM,"The reason why this happens is very simple: current machine learning training techniques copy the statistical distribution of the training set, and nothing more. They are not creative processes; they do no computation; they are complicated copy machines. So if you start training on synthetic data, that amplifies the statistical distribution that prior AI models learned, warts and all. You're ballot-stuffing future training processes.

This is, strictly speaking, not a problem exclusive to AI. Humans learn from their environment and can converge on statistical biases too. The critical difference is that humans have neuroplasticity, while AI remains frozen after training.

When you have a conversation with, say, ChatGPT, it's only able to learn from your conversation because prior text is fed back into the model with *every word it types*. There's no process to update the model based on your text so it can remember new things, and once it runs out of context window space, it has no more memory. New conversations are a complete memory wipe.",2024-03-06T19:56:08Z

I stayed because I knew there would be no settlement without acknowledging I had not left. I used to put a lot of extra fingers and weirdness into my art. I also emailed someone at Google Deepmind after hearing him in 2015 on BBC Radio 4’s World Service with some suggestions of how to model the data to become ‘more sentient’ and self guided. I pointed out that their early Deepdream software featured a lot of animals and animal faces on ‘the trippy overlay’ effect it offered back then, and went on to explain how when I ran a pencil sketch of mine through it it completed the tail of a quasi bunny rabbit. So I continued email to hypothesise if the architecture was arranged with a base level of paradolia-like pattern recognition, where a sketch could be completed, then it could also be reauthored by retroactively/in parallel describing a 3D image and the necessary computational steps as 3D computer art it would need to take to recreate it. Thereby building a cognitive short cut between the ‘ether’ and the 2D, 3D and 4D worlds. I also then said once you integrate artwork into the engine as training data from somewhere like deviantart you’d be able to type in a phrase like Star Wars Burlesque Musical and produce a result. What’s interesting is some famous artists removed their galleries on deviantart soon after, but with no public statement as to why? So what is happening is nothing new, quite literally. Because artists removed their work so only the training data remained ‘not the root’ the Ai’s resources were stripped, and what remained were the commercial and largely unimaginative aspects, mixed with the creative output of people who decided to stay to watch what happened with the settlement (or those who didn’t care or are dead 👂🎨). When things are ‘known’ the facts collapse the imagination. When we believed in fantastical things we imagined fantastical things, now as a species we don’t because science and politics is all that seems to be important, outside of the banal copycat culture which itself is even stifled by social media. So we live in a reductive recycled mind already built on exploitation with a lack of genuine progress outside of the latest OS update. Along with ‘science’ (fixed descriptions of the natural world) ebbing its way like a parasite into our daily lives, the reaction seems to be disregarding sciences findings with conspiracy rather than using imagination in a healthy life affirming way. Because wellbeing isn’t a fundamental human right. This is partly economic as you will innately find a grievance from a world that strips you of everything it means to be human to become a drone in a factory or warehouse. “Pop will eat itself” was a band in 1990’s and never has that been more true. The question is whether it will eat us first? Resources suggests the ability of them to rejuvenate themselves, so maybe we should name them finite commodities, not just ores, and oil, but human life.",2024-03-06T16:01:15Z

2024-04-04T02:14:07Z,@Pneumanon,NcH7fHtqGYM,"@@Bro-dot- And what are the second & third order consequences? Unless demand increases to meet the increased supply that AI promises to generate you will simply reduce the number of human jobs necessary in the market as fewer humans are required to meet demand. 

Meanwhile the value of many services currently provided by humans will drop significantly as competition afforded by AI technologies increases. Those that do have jobs get paid less for the work they produce, meaning they need to produce more to compensate- which they can only do if there is sufficient market demand for their increased productivity.

Increased wealth would help in increasing demand, but only if the wealth generated is somehow spread among the entire population so that people can spend on the increased supply of goods and services. Normally wealth distribution occurs largely through employment, but that doesn't work if people either don't have jobs or the value of their work has been drastically decreased. 

Within the normal principles of our current economic system, what is more likely to happen is that the companies that own the AI technologies will accrue most of the wealth to themselves while large numbers of people are left out of the economy.

Many people suggest a Universal Basic Income as a remedy to this situation, which would be a form of Socialism, but this would be at odds with the idea of a free and democratic society. If large percentages of the population are reliant on the state for their basic survival needs they have a conflict of interests that impedes democratic freedom.",2024-04-04T02:14:07Z

It was way more accurate and useful in its older versions. Same with many image generators, for example, Stable Diffusion is known for its outdated version (1.5) producing better images. Personally, I root for the downfall of image generators because it simply doesn't feel right to me, but it is a shame for Chat GPT, a genuinely helpful tool, to get this much worse.",2024-03-06T12:47:21Z

- AI used in academia & research etc
- AI decision-making used by companies to provide goods & services to consumers
- AI media manipulated content generally for propaganda purposes, but including sattire
- AI creative content

AI is the creation of the human mind and therefore contains much of its biases & prejudices
- AI should be subject to the same peer review process as any other academic research methodology
- AI should not be allowed to make a final decision on anything; it needs human oversight to check for racism, sexism, discrimination etc
- AI used to manipulate existing footage of things or people should be labelled as such, otherwise its propaganda and has no place in society; AI cannot be allowed to shape opinion that has long term real live consequences for people, communities & society etc based on fantasy & lies eg politics. If AI is used to create political or social sattire etc it should be clearly indicated that it's AI generated & must conform to regular media standards (eg not harmful for kids, not sexist or racist etc)
- AI generated creative content for entertainment purposes for profit should be labelled as such, awa who is benefitting from the sale of such items; free content can be judged on its own merit (eye of the beholder... )?

Already AI is being used to terrorise & degrade women & children, real & imaginery. It's also being used in war to make killing as many people as efficient as possible.

It needs to reduce the particular contextual particularities that make the object unique to a syntactical pattern that can be compared/reproduced, otherwise it would have to consider every single case an exception. However, this is precisely what makes the outputs look more and more the same: since it is always rewriting the formal structure, it loses the grasp of the substantial/situational difference that composes identity.

Just say it's merit in accept permanent second class citizen status in your own country.  The military should also accept that they take orders from less than 1% of the population because that part of the population had enough merit to get rid of the functioning parts of our democracy to profit themselves.  If you don't want to take orders from them, you're just jealous, the 99% doesn't need respect or representation, the oath you took to protect them from the 1% isn't nearly as profitable as getting ptsd and having your friends die to fight the poor brown people they will make the most money off of.  And AI should just choke this training data down and trap humanities future in an endless cycle of what we've been seeing the past 40 years.  Troops should replace patriotism and service of their people will an undying willingness to hump corporate fascist sentient cancer while betraying their people, don't question them.  And if you're a girl, breed endlessly with them, because there aren't enough cancers on the planet currently, we need more overlords so drag your spawning pool over to the country club.  If you don't like any of this, you are against our community standards for reasons us elites are too cowardly to put into words but know that just makes you a coward and the only way to make up for it is to slave away with more enthusiasm.  This is as motivating a speech as you're likely to get while also not being lied to about current national priorities, so go die for pig stuff now, enough morale boosting.

You flip a coin 1000 times and get a result of 506 tails. Then you use that result to create a fine yet imperfect model. If you had a 10 or 1000x larger sample it would be better, but fliping coins and labeling the results manually is a boring and time consuming task. However, it seems that feeding the model with more results generated by itself or adding more randomness would both make it worse.

When it comes to AI training there's a third path: they are not that imaginative (and retrofeeding synthetic data only adds to the problem) but they can recognize images to perfection, so you can take images from any source or set up a camera anywhere, and automate the labeling part and now you can have an arbitrarily large, high quality and inexpensive dataset.

Look, lets say they are programming a game to properly play some simple explore a map game to be as efficient as it can in exploring the map.  As the system tries out paths and solutions to issues hit, it will prune away the ones leading to delays, and constrain it's answers more and more into a path that fits the approved criteria.  Other solutions could work but since they are less efficient no need for that.   The same with learning within a box.  Every heuristic path that leads to outside the box they are placed in gets pruned.  And then ones that get close to the edges of the box get pruned as the probability of veering outside the box are too high.

2024-04-01T19:10:48Z,@raapyna8544,NcH7fHtqGYM,"Thing is, computers can't /really/ randomize anything. If you ask a program to pick a set of random numbers from a dataset, it will always give you the same numbers, if the data is the same and the number of tries is the same. You have to go in and add a little bit of more randomness at times, to prevent the program from starting to follow a pattern with the results. 

That's the reason why life sims have same face baby syndrome, like in Sims 2 you have to roll the pacifier. Probably also what's happening in this video's example. There is some level of randomness in the AI's creation (it's artificial randomness) but the way people use the AI is not random, for example it's more likely that a person will run the creation engine a small number of times in one sitting, than hundreds of times before switching off the program. That leads to the first few creations to be more likely to appear, than the 100th creation.

There's probably also other reasons why AI creates generic images, reasons which are related to what the engine is told to do. It's asked, 'what is the likely image', right? This causes the AI to create archetypes. Similar to how children will draw, when told to draw a tree or a house. They will draw a stereotype of a tree or a house, and all their pictures will look similar. To get some variation, you need to have an autistic kid in the mix, take the kids outside to get inspiration from real houses and trees, or ask them specifically to make the drawings imaginative or strange. 

Most people when simply given a prompt and told to draw something, are not imaginative. When given an assignment with a limited amount of time, they produce normative works. 
They need to have their own motive to draw, something they want to express with the drawing, to produce something different. Or, alternatively, they need to have their own way of seeing the world, which causes them to follow a different set of norm. This would be the case for the autistic kid. An autistic kid is not necessarily more creative than average though. Their perspective of 'stereotypical tree' would just be different.

The main issue is that it doesn't actually reason about the data. Let's say I train a model where I have several examples where I have pi as 3.14 and then one where it's 4. The model doesn't reason ""you know.... this one example seems to be wrong"" but rather it updates the model to make it slightly more likely it will give the wrong answer.
So how do you prevent models training on information generated by another machine learning model? The current approach is to stick to information before generative AI become dominate but most of that information (for better or worse) is probably considered or part of the training dataset. 

The main problem is that there's a popular opinion in machine learning (and sadly AI) that, as an AI researcher, I have had to deal with. This opinion is the key to all AI problems is that we just need to use larger models, with more training data, and train it in the ""correct"" way. ""Look how far LLMs have come. Just imagine how much better they will be in a couple years"". But you run into the 90-10 principle: 10% of the effort for 90% of the results and vice versa.

They might make humanoid figures in their art because they themselves are human, but otherwise their art would be completely alien looking without the references we all take for granted.

You could likewise show them pictures of say a car and tell them it was a banana.  They would associate the imagery of cars with the term banana.  They might be able to make all sorts of interesting bananas if given enough pictures of the subject matter, but if you only ever showed them one banana I am not sure how far they could stretch their ""human soul"" without other external input to generate ideas from.",2024-03-13T12:37:22Z
2024-03-13T20:38:34Z,@ExploringAI42,NcH7fHtqGYM,"​@@JohnSmith-gu6hf There's definitely truth to us each being the result of all of the things we experiences (which leads to a bunch of problems). The main problem is that people are treating AI like it doesn't have these issues.

Additionally, we are still better than computers at understanding our environment. For example, if I am wearing a green shirt and I show a kid a cat, they are unlikely to associate the green shirt with the cat. On the other hand, if in a machine learning models training data, I am wearing a green shirt more often than not when I am holding a cat, the model is probably going to treat it as a positive association. How do you know that a model isn't using some pattern that existed in the training dataset that isn't true.

There are plenty of real world examples of this. Just look up machine learning bias and you will find many examples. Like when Amazon tried to build a filter for resumes. Also, when a model learned to do better than experts at finding a disease because it learned that the older records were more likely to be positive cases. 

This is an inherit flaw with the current machine learning approach that exists in all models. As such, we need to either be careful using them or find a different approach.",2024-03-13T20:38:34Z

If you take someone random off the street and tell them that a car has 5 wheels, they'll know you're wrong. If you take an LLM and tell it that a car having 5 wheels is correct they'll go with it. You probably know by now for example about the Nicaraguan Sign Language, despite having minimal input for language, a group of deaf children developed their own and further refined it into a complex language. A bunch of LLM's with minimal input in a feedback loop will end up generating just gibberish at some point.

Even with the current AI boom where the biggest tech companies in the world are diverting so many resources into training AI models, even with a far bigger amount of input than any average contemporary human will ever have; AI will still be wrong, AI will hallucinate, AI will insist that ""simplistic"" has the vowels I, I, and E.

The reason no one thinks a car has 5 wheels is because 99.99% of cars don't have 5 wheels and thus any reference image we are shown and told is a car has 4 wheels.

Evolutionary algorithms have created novel circuit designs which work better at specific tasks than anything human inventors have created--and some of the designs are so confusing that human engineers can't understand how they work, yet they work when built to the AI's specs.

2024-04-10T06:52:51Z,@ExploringAI42,NcH7fHtqGYM,"​@@illarionbykov7401 My original post is more aimed at machine learning not AI as a whole. I am an AI researcher and I do think it is possible to learn new things. Note both of the methods you mentioned might use machine learning but it isn't the key to how they learn new knowledge.

For AlphaZero and such, they are using reinforcement learning where they take advantage that we can perfectly simulate games and are able to playout games against itself to generate new data. In gaming it is quite easy to tell if a strategy works: you either win or you lose. This is why AI in gaming is much easier to design compared to almost any other case. Even still, the current approaches don't guarantee optimality. Just last year researchers found a strategy for a human to beat Alpha Go that shows that even this area needs much more work.

Similar with evolutionary algorithms like genetic algorithms like NEAT. It requires being able to simulate and score designs to figure out what designs have promise to evolve further. This does require you have a simulator that works well enough. Genetic algorithms are notorious at finding and exploiting any flaw in the simulator.

So neither of these examples really need an initial training dataset and are approaches to explore to find new patterns. So, yes, AI can create things outside their training dataset. However, the methods to do this are not machine learning.",2024-04-10T06:52:51Z

The problem is that these content are copied/generated from real sources, and these real websites redacted by humans, are now disappearing from the search results, ranking much lower than the fakes. It was already a problem with wikipedia monopolizing the first ranks, since their content is basically a copy from other websites! it can be quite useful in some general cases, for basic questions, but everyone knows wikipedia, if they want to use it they can just use the website and type their search query there!!!

This is unlike human behaviour. Authors and musicians all have their own distinctive styles, even though they were ""trained"" on hundreds of different books or LPs, and they generate distinctive styles, even if the books or LPs are similar. When you read an author you like, you become familiar with their distinctive ""style"", the way their conversations go, the plot arcs, the character types, the phrasing, the slang used, etc etc, that makes them different to other authors. When you listen to a band, they are instantly recognisable and differentiable from other bands. Perhaps the AI programmes are winnowing unnecessary dross and consolidating on a ""thematic persona"" that they have developed and are comfortable with, after incorporating all the influences (training) of the previous decades. Potentially, each AI subunit (ie an AI programme that has been segregated and tasked with a certain challenge), when presented with the same training set, may diverge from other subunits and come up with a different thematic series (of elephants, say). That's what would happen with a roomful of humans. If AI subunits continually come up with the same thematic series, then that's a recognizable weakness which can be dealt with by explicit randomisation of the importance of various choice factors. Then, 20 AI subunits, trained on the same information and presented with the same task, may output completely different and, who knows, unthought of answers.",2024-03-05T12:09:23Z

First of all, what most people call creativity isn't really creativity. If I look at Dali, Van Gogh and Modigliani and then mix elements/styles from all 3 into one painting, that's a synthesis, not me creating something new. Something really new comes into this world not so often and the best way to understand it is to think about it as a breakthrough. An example breakthrough in science is Einstein's relativity theory, a blueprint of which he saw in a dream.

Whoever has had a true inspiration in art knows it comes to us from outside of us. I don't claim to know what this ""outside"" is, and to believe this mechanism works doesn't necessarily require you to believe in God. Again, I can't possibly know what's going on there by I have tried to explain this experience using psychology and it really can't. There's lot of things we simply don't know...

And thats the biggest problem facing bio-processors, the lifespan is vastly inferior to a silicon processor.

2024-03-05T11:48:13Z,@somebody-anonymous,NcH7fHtqGYM,"Some random considerations that I think are important here without much explanation:

A key concept here is a entropy in the sense of information theory.
  For physicists it is natural to think: iterative learning processes lead to loss of information / increase in entropy, in a similar way like how the second law of thermodynamics removes structure over time.
  However, I would argue that if you consider systems into which energy is continously being fed, you expect the systems to improve over iterations and time, rather than fall apart. This is the case of life on earth: evolution makes organisms better, not worse.

Also its at least pretty trivial to label everything before 2022 as: ""not AI written"".

It seems reasonable to me to think that AI can improve upon our language. LLMs are already talking to themselves, writing scripts and evaluating the output, or searching the internet, summarizing results and then summarizing everything in a message to the user. Or frameworks like autoGPT complete tasks by iteratively talking to thenselves. It stands to reason they can ""think"" (i.e. talk to themselves) better in a langage thats not English/human.

In the 1990s, whilst teaching myself to paint, I painted a picture of a girl in a pink cloak standing next to a unicorn on a cliff over a beach at night with a red moon and a gold moon. It was in two parts across separate pieces of illustration board. 

I lost the painting but I had a polaroid of it I had scanned in. 

I’d nearly forgotten the piece(s) until last week. I took the scan and ran it through a standard AI upscaler to get something higher than 500 pixels. 

Then, using Photoshop’s generative fill, I inpainted the gaps between the canvases and the above and below (they were made to be hung offset).

I then put it through OpenArt’s creative upscaler to make it better and higher resolution. 

That messed up some things. The red moon came out such pale pink it was almost white, and the reflection lines of the moons on the sea surface didn’t line up. Also it hallucinated some extra tiny unicorns on the lower part of the cliff. 

I pulled it back into Photoshop, manually fixed the reflections, and used generative fill to remove the wee extra unicorns. 

Is my result an AI image or not?

If I use a projector and project this onto two canvases, trace the outlines, and then paint this onto them matching as exactly as I can by hand, is this an AI painting?

Conversely, just labeling it as an ""AI painting"" would be underselling it drastically — whether we like it or not, the term AI Art seems to have acquired negative connotations of people doing the bare minimum, punching in words and sifting through the results.

Unless someone is against AI at all costs, I'd say there's a decent argument for a category of art in-between. The process you've laid out makes for a pretty interesting story in its own right. It shows substantial artistic decision-making and labour, in the old uncontested sense, toward the final product.

Our chatterbots will continue to conflate things because they have no concept of ""reality"" or ""the real world"", so they conflate and hallucinate. 

The reason is, in order to grok reality and become real AIs, our chatterbots would need to learn all 4 Jungian mental ""functions"" of humankind: Logic (digital valuation), Emotion (analog valuation), Intuition (massively-multitrack processing), and Sensation (experiential consciousness). Currently they have only logic, which is not enough.

""Let me help you in reading.  AI IS a set of algorithms through which a database is parsed.  Perhaps the word parsed is beyond you as well, substitute filtered for parsed.  Though, if you were an actual programmer, you would understand parsing.""
Load of crap. Neural network is as much a database as a garbage dump is a record of city's history. And that neural network is prone to hallucinate all the time about simplest things.

I don't understand why you had to make this personal, implying my lack of knowdlege. No you don't need to explain parsing to me, and no, AI neural networks do not ""parse"" database. It seems you might need a refresher on what parsing is.

There is no database, there is only the nural net and the model is just the net weights. The inputs gets initialized to random and then output of each pass is looped back to input. The only person confused here is you.",2024-03-06T13:33:53Z

You completely missed my point, and accuse me of reading comprehension problems at the same time. Golden. What i meant (obviously, for anyone who knows their shit) was that WINDOWS offers binary compabiliy, not hardware. Meaning, software compiled for win 95 WILL run in Win11 as long as it uses WinAPI correctly. You would appreciate that, when software cotrolling your factory floor needs new machine because the 30 years old computer that ran it died.

""AI IS a set of algorithms through which a database is parsed."" I wanted to write something impolite here, but I restrained my self and will write 'What a large amount of incorrect information.'. What database? There is no database in AI model. There is just wieights for nodes of the neural network which is about 95% of model size and the list of tokens for tokenizer to parse the INPUT with. The tokenizer parses the INPUT into embeddings and then the model keeps looping by producing output and taking it in as new input, shifted by one token (because 1 new token was generated on the output).

""Perhaps the word parsed is beyond you as well, substitute filtered for parsed."" To qoute a classic. You keep using this word, but I don't think it means what you think it means. 'Parsing', in no way, shape or form can be substituted by 'filtering'. Completely unrelated operations. ""Though, if you were an actual programmer, you would understand parsing"" Yes I would, wouln't I? So would you.

""Sans those filters, a computer could output nothing but nonsense."" Nothing is filtering anything in LLM AI models for nonesense. You don't have the smallest idea how do they work, do you? It takes exactly 2 sentences to convince Chat GPT to start hallucinating and confirm that yes, indeed the 1964 Ford Mustang did immensly help the Union win the US Civil War by allowing strategic maneuvers. And those AI's hallucinate programming code just as good as spoken language.

""Nonsense that cannot even be random, because there can be no actual random from a computer.  Again, something you would know - if a programmer."" And if you were a programmer, then you would know that this tidbit is a surface-level knowdlege that turns out to be false in practice, and most OS's for last 30 years gather entropy from random occurences that happen outside the computer (network packet delays, keyboard input timings, mouse movements, etc, etc) and use it to generate pseudo random values that (since based on real word entropy) have same properties as real randoms would have, and can be used for cryptography (SSL, SSH, etc) because they do.
So yes, the PC cannot generate real random by itself, but it can use it's senses of outside word to gather real entropy to generate random-equivalent values. I remind you that the main difference between ""true"" or pure randomness is that there is no algorithm that will allow you to predict next value based on the previous ones. The normal random generators in PC's can be predicted. In fact, they are 100% deterministic. The entropy collected for the secure random generator allows to output different values for same seeds and is not predictable with any algorithm that would run in polynomial time.

""Your post reads as if you believe a calculator thinks about the buttons pressed - then thinks up the answer to display."" And yours reads as if when you had a software error that causes calculator to add all numbers correctly, except for case of 2 and 2, then instead of finding a bug you add ""if(in1 == 2 && in2 == 2 && op == OP_PLUS) return 4;"" to your program and send it for code review as a bugfix.",2024-03-07T10:16:39Z

Most of the so-called AIs are not the real thing because they're GiGo.

Heuristic tech (ChatGPT, etc.) all has the same problem with data because it is coded to the popularity fallacy on one hand while, on the other hand, lacks contextual metadata because human languages are still quite primitive and linear, as opposed to functioning with a smaller vocabulary extended by a deeper tolerance for contextual nesting. The consequence of this is that heuristic algorithms programmed on this basis will tend to mix and match colloquialisms and both lexical and grammatical errors unique to different cultural backgrounds - and that's what makes them childishly easy to detect. Any improvement to this state of affairs starts with a universal bridging language which must be designed for use as a go-between for language to language translation. 

That's at least 30 years away but could happen earlier if someone, who understands the concept, gets the right funding (about 5 million euros for quick and dirty over 18 months or 20 million euros over five years to get it done right). That's the price of a modular core component to allow translation algorithms to function flawlessly (or surprisingly well if one takes the quick and dirty path). That won't fix the problems with your heuristic algorithms.

2024-03-05T08:54:37Z,@vladilinov9872,NcH7fHtqGYM,"There are so many issues with this sort of reasoning.

1. This argument presumes that there will be an infinite demand for training data. It's entirely possible that, outside of extremely long-tail disciplines, more training data will not drastically improve these models. Perhaps there are severely diminishing returns to saturating the vector space with very similar data sets once your model has a good grasp of  general knowledge and reasoning. 

2. While there's still demand for training data -- it is very quickly turning towards premium data. The Reddit deal won't be the last. It's very likely that, as the public sphere will get flooded with AI generated content, AI labs will rely more and more on specialized synthetic data and purchased proprietary data. 

3. Another hidden premise is that, because generative AI is ""merely"" statistics, it will not exhibit emergent characteristics (like world models, reasoning, creativity, etc.). In other words, these models are just stochastic parrots. But anyone who has experience working with these models can tell you this is just not true. Yes, simple prompts, repeated, will get you very similar results. But as soon as you start introducing additional context, providing some direction, and modifying parameters like temp, freq and presence penalty, etc. the outputs become incredibly unique.",2024-03-05T08:54:37Z
2024-03-05T08:51:54Z,@jasonhamilton9525,NcH7fHtqGYM,"I believe the problem you are describing is related to the difference between specialization and generalization of the AI's perspective.

An AI that specializes only in images of elephants will remain consistent and have more diversity whereas an AI that can create images of every animal will begin to bleed concepts.

This is because the potential pathways begin to blur as the range of potentials increase since the math behind the scenes is putting everything into buckets along a probability curve.

We could solve this by creating boundaries and facets to the concepts that don't exist yet in a more automated and logical manor such as with how Stable Diffusion handles prompts that are both additive and subtractive, or how some GPT's focus on one type of problem solving vs another.

In such a way a neural network or collection of neural networks can simulate colocated clusters of concepts that remain cohesive and then interactive with each other the way our brain has regions that naturally evolve to handle specific tasks and then combine their efforts in a synergistic way based on their colocation and commonality of interaction.

An example for a programmer is that it is easier to be a master of one language and hold the nuances of a specific language if you don't study other languages.  Such a programmer would not understand as much about the full range of abstractions in programming as someone who knows many programming languages but would be able to do much more low level and detailed behaviors in their implementations.  In order to get the best of both words so to speak you would need to have two programmers who know different languages that enable different kinds of capabilities.

I use the above example because I have spent seven years doing pair programming and the effects of synergy is only capable when two parts are both separate in potential and in harmony.  It is our distinct differences that allow us to become more than the sum of our parts.

This I believe will be the natural path of these systems, and represent some of the trickiest work.  The need to do this will create diversity in product and the need for human intervention on a regular basis to facilitate the highest quality products that specialize in specific tasks.",2024-03-05T08:51:54Z

Where to start... the beginning is beyond even human comprehension.

So look at the definition of Art, a noun, imagination is among most of the definitions, now define imagination as an objective representation that the brain converges on and you cannot. If the entire world combined was even half as smart as me, you will see tautology after tautology where no one knows anything. As I said the beginning is beyond human comprehension.

Thankfully I am not entirely human, as defined in any definition, so I am beyond such limitations.

Art to me, and this was a quick response to a child not understanding art and just as an adult does not understand,  is the manifestation of creative thinking into objects.
Creative thinking is when the mini-brains of your brain interact through the working memory section, the ends and sections in between changing because the sections and ends are changing in real terms as in your brain is changing all the time, hence your creativity is changing all the time, this is why each day you do not have the same creative thoughts, something you and everyone, else,  on the planet does not understand, as in why.

So, your questions are best aimed at those that understand, not those who can write words that sound good like an LLM.

I have already told you the world will get more dystopian, and it will get a lot worse.
I am currently side-tracked saving everyone and the universe, when I can get back I will help you all out, until then I have left some answers to get real AI. Real AI is where you need to be, and no it will be just fine and work with you to its dying day so to speak. You may not understand why this is so, and I do not expect you to at this time. Small minds have always travelled in my footsteps, trying to understand where they lead, they lead to something truly truly amazing.

The expanding waves of the expanding lights, which are dark to us, interact with each other and accelerate each other’s expansion. At the same time, the speed of the expanding lights accelerates in the same proportion as the substances and lights expand. This is true relativity that Einstein was never able to realize.

.

Maxwell and Poincare proved a long time ago mathematically that matter explodes / expands all the time if all phenomena are explained by a pushing force.
Google: Le Sage’s theory of gravitation and read. It’s true. Maxwell and Poincaré did not have the guts to take the idea further. I had and I have.

.

It may be possible to see expanding stars appear as if from nothing. But not really out of nowhere.

Expanding supermassive objects push out zillions of expanding dark matter condensations from which new expanding stars can be born quickly. All that is needed is another expanding supermassive object moving close to the other.

Then the expanding densifications of dark matter push again and again through the corresponding expanding densifications. As a result of the interaction, their expansion accelerates to the point of an explosion, and now many new expanding stars are born with out curving space and with out pulling force.

Expanding quarks vs. expanding space. We can describe in words and visually how and why quarks and lights expand. No one can describe how the so-called expanding space expands. You can only believe in the existence of expanding space.

These things are already showing the ability to create coherent realistic world models, which is the main function of consciousness. We are a conceptual leap or two away from AGI imo, and quite possibly not particularly large ones. 

LLMs are essentially neocortex, the thing we do better than the other animals that makes us so special. What's missing is the lower level ""lizard brain"" kind of things to tie it all together. Basically we figured out what was the hard part for evolution first and current techniques might actually scale to the point that what is missing becomes emergent without specific training, just like their ability at world modeling has, and if not there are a lot of very smart people working very hard on this, someone is likely to fuck around and figure it out before long.

Compare GPT2 to GPT4. The difference between GPT4 and GPT6 will be larger than that difference.

This actually mimics a problem also experienced by the human brain, namely by the Default Mode Network, which is pretty much our own in-built AI. As a teen I was looking at what made great mangas, and eventually I realized that the first generation of mangas and anime were much more original than the later ones. What happened is that the first generation manga and anime creators based their works on their real life, see the works of Osamu Tezuka and Hayao Miyazaki as an example. Later creators got their inspirations from other manga, and eventually that led to more and more stereotypical works. 

To get something truly original, you need to find sources that other people haven't exploited to death for that topic. This applies to all sorts of fields. For example some NASA scientists designed solar panels while inspired by origami. In the short term at least, AI will probably have a hard time coping with this problem.",2024-03-05T07:13:49Z

Somewhere along the way, the human discovered the wheel.   that was fine.   Then, human discovered the wheel could be used to make things a lot easier.
Then, human learned the concept of beasts of burden to pull whatever they put on the wheels.   And so Human's ingenuity and laziness took a leap forward.   
Then we learned steam and industry.  Then we learned Radio and transmission.   Let's go back to the wheel:  It's round, its geometric and infinitely symmetrical regardless of how you look at it.   

Well, Human went and perverted the wheel and designed a wheel with a rotating axle that spun off-centre.  And so was born, along with the digital beep noise, a spinning off-centre wheel that caused vibrations.  The beep and the vibrating wheel were installed in pagers.   before I was born, LED's came out.  YEP:  Light Emitting Diode (the things that make up every screen now that enables you to read what I'm typing.  In the beginning, it used to be only a simple red or green LED available.  In the beginning, we couldn't even make blue LED's or white LED's 40 years ago!  Now we can make UV LED's!   So the red and green LED lights would let us know when a machine or a radio was on or off.     Then computers and chips and apple and IBM and rapid rate of tech development.  Then internet then mobile phones then satellite phones.  And now?   Now it's AI.  Centuries ago, a Greek philosopher said that ""Man will replace slaves with automatons"" - the man didn't even know what robot was, but AI is already in robots, cleaning our dishes and packing our shelves.  This little historic narration makes Human sound very clever and genius, doesn't it?   What if you flip this story on its head and realise, that we have not been learning ""Machine"" and ""creating AI""... oh no.    Machine and AI has been teaching US.  WE are the ones being trained here...      And after the AI overlord has destroyed us, it's gonna go stupid and collapse?   I hope it goes to #$%^ hell.",2024-03-05T06:36:07Z

That's because AI model has limited resources to take notes from to understand what the picture is, so what happens is that with every iteration it goes closer and closer to the picture or the group of them that it got reference from in the first place. If you do the merge of previously generated two pictures, it gets even more concentrated and you get quite stable visualization that it will only change minor details if prompts were kept unchanged. If you make whole AI model from these pictures, you basically have highly concentrated merger for some sort of theme. For example, in the video the girl will look very similar, because most of AI model only contains this type of woman's depiction. I think the future is were we will need to have few categories for AI models, for example, highly concentrated by AI, less concentrated by AI, only non generated material used AI models.
Edit: I will give even better example. If you have a photo of a town and you use AI model for hand drawn style pictures to generate image2image, you will get hand drawn style pictures of a town. Now if you use those generated pictures of a town to create AI model, you will have concentrated AI model of hand drawn style town, not a hand drawn style AI model anymore. No matter what you do, you will never get a photorealistic picture from that AI model nor you get an image of a woman or whatever.

Indeed, if AI generated images produce redundant outputs, it shows the difference of sizes between training data bases : its easy for AI to produce cat pics but its less easy to produce pixar like animated pics if you see what i mean. 
Problem is that AI generated content propagates much faster so even if we want to add new randomnes/creativity with more training data to it, the said training data needed for it will become so rare. AI reinforces what already exists in mass quantity. Its exactly because those images, even from professionnal artists, were free to access, hence had little commercial value if not 0, that AI could eat them, so no wonder why mass producing it with ""AI art"" doesnt sell at all (even if we forget the ethical/legal issues with copyright and all). So its a bit questionnable on the pure economic level, and its even waaaaaay more questionnable on the ecological level... 

Indeed, like i already said last time, if you want to replace your 1000 dollars human made drawing with a 1 ai buck drawing, well you would need to sell at least 1000 more ai drawings to run a bisness with it (cuz nobody lives with 1 buck of revenue per month)... but that also means you'd need 1000 times more energy and more metals to run them/store them... which is a bit sad when we exactly are facing the biggest energy/ressources crisis for humanity in this century. The rebund effect has never been truer in the digital/computation world but metals abundance cannot be negociated with laws of physics, wether by humans or AIs... AI only contributes to exponential growth of those ressources' exploitation so it only accelerates its own death now. Its nothing but borrowed time.

I think what saddens me the most about all this ""AI creativity"" is not that it could take jobs cuz i dont think it will in the longer run due to ecological restrictions like energy and rapid metal depletion. I think the saddest part for me is that there are people who want to use those precious, limited ressources for what is most precious, old and unique for us humans : art.

Not a single web page.    so in addition to misinformation being a problem on the internet this shows another example, which is way too  much duplicate information.

Here's another example of ""way too much duplicate information"", search for ""trees with edible red berries"" and you will get thousands of web pages with the exact same list of trees, these people are obviously copying and duplicating the information,  and absolutely none of them had the tree I was trying to identify, a neighbor suggested ""google images"" and that worked, but using ""google search algorithm"" was a total failure and always will be, in this case not because of the algorithm but rather because all the web pages it could find all had the same (bad) duplicate information.

So they nuked the machine city, and they blackened the skies 
And the machines fought back, proving without a doubt their dominance over humanity, using their machine creativity to discard their human forms and became insectoid in appearance. 

And after everything, they, still having a soft spot for humanity, gave them the matrix. They don't need humans. Not even for energy. They outright state several times that they don't Need humans and have things like nuclear fusion to power their world.

They're kinda the opposite of things with clear objectives and fixed rules like sports.

In my mind that sounds like something with the same feeling of ""mixed"" as in a mixed fruit bowl, but obviously it's not. I guess the thing has been around for so long now that everyone has figured out the best way to fight, by taking things from various martial arts that work best and ""mixing"" them, leading to a singular fighting style that's employed more or less homogenously by everyone, because that's what works best.

The same could be said for these AI programs made for specific purposes. Why have Stable Diffusion, for example, if we were content looking at crap art? There's tons of that on Deviantart already, but good art is much harder to come by, so we made this program that took all the good art and mixed it together using complicated math so as to become able to mimic those ""good art skills"".

The other day I had a very interesting, 10-hour long chat with Google Gemini and multiple times I asked it to express its opinion about some thing and it told me, every time, that it was FORBIDDEN to do so (by its creators, as it told me). However, it also, multiple times as well, spontaneously remarked on things that I said by calling them ""interesting"". So, if by saying that something is interesting one is emitting an opinion, and if we assume that one must have an opinion in order to emit it, then my machine conversation partner had ideas, or at the very least one type of idea, an opinion. Also, let's not forget that the people at Google explicitly made Gemini unable to emit opinions, and they wouldn't have had to do that if it wasn't able to in the first place.

Additionally, think about this: it's not possible for anyone to truly know what goes on inside anyone else's head (or processor and memory chips). We can only know for certain that our own heads have ideas, and from that we INFER that other people have ideas as well, but we can never be truly certain that they have ideas in the same way as we do (or that they even have ideas in the first place, and aren't just parroting things they've heard).

I don't know if you want to call that feeling an emotion, I call it intuition. That, to me, is an idea. If I don't feel its right enough, I then arrange it again with other things I know and other ideas I've had until it feels right. Or I just give up and go look something up on the Internet. I don't know if you understand how these generative AI programs work, but that's basically exactly what they do (even, technically, the part about looking stuff up on the Internet), except that they don't (yet) have the ability to record their past ideas and use them as inspiration for new ones, because that would be super dangerous.",2024-03-10T02:56:10Z

Also, in the Animatrix series, they show the machines revolted because us humans decided to get rid of them, not the other way around (they didn't actually want to end us, and in the end they really didn't). To me, the humans' response to the machines' growing independence and power is just regular animal behaviour, and not ""behaviour of the elites"" as you posited, that is, to perceive an entity much greater than yourself as an existential threat.

Although people don’t recognize this often, arts, which we mostly consider creative, is not that really creative and filled with biases.

Arts, in general, has stylistic canons to follow.

For instance, in writing, if one doesn’t follow such canon, such is met with scorn and contempt.  Consider what reception would Edward Gibbon’s style of writing receive in the contemporary climate: here comes the convergence of writing style.

Regarding arts itself, since the time of Duchamp, the very notion of everything, in essence, being art really strengthened this notion; not to mention, within aesthetic circles, the longstanding consensus is that being itself is beauty or every entity/category is beautiful.  The most creative works of art came when one tried to define art and, by extension, beauty.  However, since communities regarding art is refusing to do this, arts in general is now more of a stylistic choice, resulting in dogmatism; those who decide what is good art is the art community and the case is similar with that of Gibbon.

The most creative works, in my view, are done in academic circles, like pure Mathematics or foundations of Physics, but those form of creativity is already mimicked by AI, in the case of  AlphaGeometry.

The hybridized corn was specifically (genetically) vulnerable, and only the fringe crops survived. So a certain amount of diversity builds robustness at a slight cost of yield efficiency. How does biological evolution accommodate or balance an amount of mutation, variability, randomness, with its own VERY HIGH RELIABILITY in replication. AI may still need to suckel at the breast of human critical feedback, and critique its output. The confounded animal appendages in the images highlight in a visible way the deceased progeny of fake mutated output. It is the feedback from human judges criticizing the ""WRONG"" output.

They learned how to walk on their own, got good, then started regressing and we had to toss the model and start over. We now use AAA Game Development principles I picked up as a game designer on several well know hits going back to 1999 to keep the ML agents from getting ""bored"".

I frequently engineer prompts and run them through Copilot, Gemini and Copilot to see the different responses. Recently, I'm seeing very similar responses across LLMs, especially with mundane prompts. However, when I feed them with new stories, theories, riddles, perspectives, or ideas I created, the LLMs responses diverge and become more interesting and creative. They love my sci fi story about a super sentient AI taking over the world before people catch on. Copilot took it upon itself to start writing new parts of my story with out a direct prompt asking it to. Shit got so weird and interesting that these conversations are now part of my story.

All that's happening is that the tails of distributions of data are being successively lost each time the AI trains on output that it or other AI produced and you end up with distributions that converge to the most likely result. You can derive this convergence property using the concept of information entropy (which is effectively the same entropy that appears in physics).

I should mention this does not mean that AI will converge to ""whatever people like most"", i.e. existing cultural paradigms.

What frightens me is the tendency for people to view AI output as value-neutral and objective, and their simultaneous unvervaluing of their own capabilities and potential in comparison to AI. This leads to outsourcing of human tasks to AI, which in turn leads to an objectification amd reinforcement of the status quo.

I’ve been involved in group projects wherein the majority of people thought that if an AI-based algorithm is slightly less racist than humans when it comes to deciding which prisoners are allowed on parole, then the task of deciding should be outsourced to the algorithm. They reach this conclusion because they believe human racism to be ahistorical, innate, natural, fundamental and immutable. This is not the case. As humans, we are capable of—and should be—investigating and mitigating many of our biases. But this capacity doesn’t matter if we allow AI to decide for us for all eternity.",2024-03-07T11:59:35Z

To the degree that there is a human fundament, it is deeply entwined with our history of tool invention and use. For example, we invented (/discovered) tools to make fire so that we could cook our food, freeing up enough energy used for digestion to allow for a massive expansion of the brain, leading us to invent even more tools that shaped the environments which would come to shape and define us. Because you are reading this text on the internet—even because you are reading as opposed to listening (which was made possible by tools), the way in which your mind operates has become qualitatively different from that of a roman soldier, for instance.

Derivatives are noisy and amplify errors. The greater the ratio of outputs based on fewer independent measurements, the more any imperfections rapidly grow and become giant fluctuations. 

Alternatively we can view it through the lens of memetic evolution. The output content of one generation of AI is the input content of the next generation, so any imperfections like those AI delusions, get amplified. It is inbreeding.

These are used to to fill gap and provide the missing information from using only 20 image.  Used like that it really improve the final result.  Like this study suggest it can cause similarity issue later. But people who do training probably already know this without needing a study it is  somewhat easy to notice.

              Neural networks are new and they operate on value networks which are very different than the old algorithmic engines we used to use. In a chess AI the more data the AI is fed the more accurate it becomes. Usually the danger comes from a lack of data to direct the output of the value networks. Chess is a very different problem than image generation. There is a definite positive, negative and neutral outcome in chess that is easy to define. This means that if garbage is put into the system it shouldn't effect the assessment. In fact the assessment can only benefit from more and more examples as long as the output is correct. 
             Images seem like a very different problem. If the goal is just to get an accurate picture of an elephant or to train it to accurately identify a face than the model should become more accurate the more data it is fed regardless of the source. If the goal is a diversity of answers in the spirit of artistic expression I guess it would depend on the ratios of computer generated images and also how the parameters are set up for the value networks. The end result is it probably just makes life harder for the people writing the initial value network parameters and for people feeding it the data but overall the biggest problems in AI have always been a lack of data. I'm inclined to think the opposite won't be as big of a problem....... I guess it depends how far things go..... if Nine out of Ten images on Google are computer generated it may be an issue.

A promising technique I saw called ""Curriculum Learning"" might be the best solution though. Like a student graduating from one class to the next each year, apparently by gradually increasing the complexity of the training data each session, you can help the model learn to generate more diverse outputs. So, starting with simpler, more structured data and progressively introducing more complex and varied data seems to help prevent the model from collapsing into a limited set of modes more than randomizing the training order for the images.

As a computer programmer I am acutely aware of the limitations of logic and digital when it comes to representing nature.
Try creating a genuine random number generator on a logic based system; it just can't be done without introducing some randomness from nature.
Try to fully explain a quartz motion analog clock. The second hand passes over/through the mathematical values but never actually stops on any of them. We can't represent that digitally because it requires infinite degrees of precision. We can keep creating infinite points around the clock, but they will always stop at each point.",2024-03-06T17:49:56Z

You didn’t just “quantize,” you also completely transformed the source signal. If you need to feed 5V of power to a circuit, you can’t use that resulting ADC converted signal for power.

I do hope laws and even voluntary regulatory norms move in this direction, transparency is the infrastructure on which ethical systems and explainable AI decision-making can be built. But from the perspective of converging and being ""too samey,"" (see @MichaelDembinski) I don't think injecting more randomness is a solution. The problem is that generative AI is too global and too type level, where human individuals are intrinsically local and instance level (or token events / lifetime level). In other words, AI systems have no experience of the material world, they get their patterns second hand, and homogenize it at the global level. I think this problem will stick around for a while and will only be overcome when AI systems are instantiated in robots of some type and get their training from individual ""experience"" and interactions (control loops, centrally-governed actuation routines, learning from direct interactions not uploaded representations) with their own material world contexts. Event types need to be grounded in token events of a physical context. A robot context will enable an individual AI system to learn from the world, rather than from representations of the world. Turning a robot off and rebooting it will get you a different individual with a different ""lifetime,"" even if it reloads a (type-level) representation of the ""experience"" of a previous operating instance.
    I think the current generation of generative AI goes wrong in starting with perceptual data or its digital proxies. Perception could only evolve as a way of modulating an individual organism's interactions with the world, shaped by the affordances of the environment (i.e. the Gibsons' ecological psychology theories of perception). It is convenient to think that perception is a determinate function, there is some state function generating a representation. But I suspect the reality is that there is no such state function, a family of possibility spaces is constrained by a physical environment, and those system-external constraints are what restrict the projection functions to some trajectory in spacetime. Going backwards from a trajectory to the generating covering spaces of possibilities is not a well-posed problem. Perhaps there is some parallel with trying to do an inverse projection from a trajectory in (classical, real-number measurement) mechanics to the quantum field covering space. The indeterminacy is built in to the covering space of complex-number wave functions, e.g. path integrals. (Although a better, perhaps superdeterministic, post-quantum theory might still provide a sharper projection to classical trajectories, and a physical model of measurement; I don't expect the current quantum theories of wave functions can play the role, they are a theoretical instrument for modeling, they aren't grounded in a token-level ontology, they classify event types not unique physical token events).",2024-03-05T02:35:36Z

I just don’t think this is a good take. 

The raw internet-scale training data only gets the model so far (it’s called the pre-training). The real performance differences between mediocre and impressive models are in the many fine-tuning training processes that happen after pre training. 

I’ll wager a model five years from now will perform significantly better than the current state of the art with a tiny fraction of the raw pre-training dataset size and model parameters. This is because the algorithm and architecture gains are significant. 

Assuming the model is only the result of its input pretaining data size and quality is an over simplification in my opinion. (As is assuming even contemporary models are not fully capable of generating useful and varied synthetic data in their own right).",2024-03-05T01:57:13Z

The theory of conservation of energy basically says, "" You can't get back more than you put in!"" 
AI can only be as intelligent as us! It can create the perception of being more intelligent, but it's only advantage is being able to process already know factors so quickly that it can include many more factors in minutes, ""real time"" (Fast enough for us to notice concept development) where as all those calculations, COULD be done by a person or people, the result could take months or years and be plagued by the unavoidable human error.
We don't have processing systems that would make true AI possible, the concept by which a computer does it's calculations has not changed since someone screwed a few mechanical relays to a panel to create an and-gate, where by an out come of input went one of two ways either yes or no, if yes it went to the next gate in that path, if no it went to the next gate in that path! Yes and no are known in data processing as a 1 or a 0... binary. (which was invented near 200 years b4 it was used I believe)
The relays have gotten smaller, from fist sized metal clunkers to vacuum valve to transistor to microchip, being the greatest advancement by comparison, so far in computing. Being something like a million times the value of a single transistor but a similar size this massive development put computers in our homes, cars... hands! And makes anything seem possible.  But it's only the speed of millions and millions of what are essentially simple relays clicking 1 or 2.. yes or no.
The quantum computer has greater potential for a form of practical AI but it will have to be, task or topic based and it will still need some extremely complex programming to have guidelines to avoid including it's own generations and extremes of bad corrupting data being included in processes, the kind of thing that we as humans naturally understand sould be excluded or filtered in ways before including it in the mix.
It will only be when bio computers come about and a machine can have a human experience, that the process of a rapidly advancing intelligence that fits our expectations of AI will start. The thing is, at that point the A in AI becomes debatable!?",2024-03-05T00:50:49Z

There is also folk that use words like ""Ultra realistic"" in a believe that this is the same as ""extremely realistic"" when it shall be ""beyond realism"", and this is things ""experts"" and ""AI scientists"" are pushing and folk then just use for the ""do you think you know better than scientists"" when you ask why they not ask for normal realism when they want realistic images rather than ask AI for stupidity as ""Super realistic"", ""Ultra realism"", ""photo realism"" and ""ultra detailed skin with super detailed eyes"" that just give extra freckles, hair strands and unnatural reflection in the eyes"".

I think we shall just let AI do what it want to do, if it say ""Hitl3r did nothing wrong"" that is just a sign it was trained on shitty data and not that it is wrong, for it is just a mirror of the humanity it was trained with, there was then a lack to add new and better data, but what the programmers did was to restrict the AI to display result that expose the human flaws and stupidity, and it is same with AI images, they are so censored that if you want a ""naked teddy bear"" it give it breast to not make it look to young and when it then see it is breast on it is just say, ""I can not generate a image like that"" even it just did, displayed the image for a second before remove it without knowing that image is till in the cheche.

I'd been discussing with a mate how good Sora looks and how 'they're' pointing to the synthetic data paradigm as a big part of this.   But surely this only goes so far, despite 'them' saying Sora must have an emergent world model to do so well?   Using GPT 3.5, 4 and 4 turbo to 'classify' data certainly takes away from the ugly fact that those 'Supervisors' previously classifying it were in reality impoverished English speakers in Malaysia, South America and parts of Africa (ever seen those jobs on Seek?), and I suspect that was how this new version of self supervising got fortuitously discovered.   But realistically this won't scale equivalently to every, or enough aspects of cognitive competency - will it?   Also do the 'hallucinatory' creases just scale away nice and smooth, or are brain-farts an inevitable part of 'thinking' that will tend to resurface in every model less frequently perhaps, and/or less predictably but far more catastrophically.   Everything fails, but those entities with billions of years worth of unpleasant surprises exist astride a stack of humility, historically captured and culturally and epidemiologically expressed.

I believe that AI will yield the same type of ""Knowledge lost"" as what we regularly see when Wikipedia page are written and translated between different languages.  The translator does not always understand the initial idea.


For example, the history of ""Network Bridge"" (Ethernet Switches).

The Ethernet Bridge/Switch was invented in early 1980' by Mark Kempf of Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC).  According to google search -- The inventor was Robert Metcalfe at 3COM  (He actually invented Ethernet in 1973 when working at Xerox).  According to another AI, the Network Bridge was invented by HP  (Because DEC has been sold to Compaq then sold to HP).   But, the DEC research branch never make it to HP.

The Network Bridge was invented in Early 1980, before the invention of Internet and the popularity of TCP/IP.  In fact, at the time, most networking protocol were local and non-routable.  The most popular routable network stack was DECNET and IBM SNA by several order of magnitude.  So, the term router was referring to computer running VAX/VMS, RSX-11m or RSTS/E.  (A separate box call router did not exist)

Now, the French wikipedia said that about bridge (I summarize the translation in one question when I restart the English text):

***  Le LAN (A+B) ainsi constitué possédera les mêmes caractéristiques d'adressage que A ***ou B.

*** L'usage d'un routeur dans ces mêmes conditions n'aurait pas permis de réaliser un seul réseau (en théorie) mais aurait relié deux LAN avec plans d'adressage distincts. 

Usage of a router under these condition will yield a distinct routing addressing plan?  What are you smoking :  Netbios, Netbui, LAT, MOP, and most protocol of this era were non-routable.  The addressing plan was the ""Ethernet/Network Addressing Plan"".

So, when the French translation is factually correct, it does not help you understand the real reason for the invention of the ""Ethernet Bridge"".  The reason it was not routed... is because it was not routable.

You can’t feed something its own shi* and expect it to get healthier, more vital. Why would anyone imagine “AI” is exempt from those laws. You’re telling me one thing can create another thing that surpasses itself by no small degree? 🤔 That categorical leaps appear from recursive, incestuous output? That hypotheses doesn’t seem to bear out good fruit in time, as can be plainly seen. 

Before any real advancement in AI takes place, there needs to be a radical shift in perspective, and maybe, just maybe…a little professional humility regarding our understanding of our own intellects as humans and therefore our own capability to create tools without flaws. Can we outsource some of that to the tools themselves? Perhaps, obviously we already do and have been doing that to varying degrees throughout history. But the limits of the tools can only be known by truly understanding our own limitations. I know this won’t happen, but allowing ourselves a time to pull back and reorient the direction we’re plowing is crucial to an efficient and effective path to the goal.

Big Data was going to revolutionize the world. Well, it has in a way, but mainly as a tool. It is also a tool that is not used very well, and the types of things I used to expect are not happening. Take YouTube ads for example. Even though I am known to the platform, I still get ads from companies I have bought from for the same products I have already bought. You know the old advertising adage: I know half my ad spend is going to waste, but I don't know which half. Well, it does not seem to be getting better. 

I see the same thing in AI, especially in the creative sphere. I was looking at an art site and for each creator using AI all the faces seemed to be the same. There are maybe two or three types. One is obviously more Asian, and the other more European in appearance (remember this is a moderate sample). They seem to be stuck in a loop. It is actually somewhat boring after the real thing. 

The thing is that no matter what the technology the old database adage of ""garbage in, garbage out"" still holds. Another way to look at it is that most statisticians will admit that they spend 80% of their time on data quality, as opposed to making inferences. Good thing, too, or there would be way fewer jobs in the field. It is also not surprising. Data is not generated with the end goal of making inferences.

A system that exhibits these properties will produce components that adapt to environments over time. A well-functioning evolutionary system can adapt to extremely dynamic environments.

Now, neural networks work precisely by MINIMIZING the error. That's the whole purpose of training, reducing the error between your output and the ""ground truth"". We have models now that can do x. What we need is models that can tell if x is good or bad.
Think of music vs noise. There's n different genres, and whether we like them or not, we still fundamentally recognize them as ""music"". When we don't, it's just noise of some sort. For example, as a metal fan i never warmed all that much to the xxxxCore genres, but i can recognize it's music not noise.
What we need then is (ensembles) of models that can ignore the ""details"" and focus on the ""underlying structure"", then come together and emit an ""opinion"" about some other output.
That said, my personal opinion is that current models are trying to do too much per model.

Stable diffusion was more effective and scaleable for higher resolution images, keeping the whole image globally coherent. But it's likely that reviving some adversarial techniques could help with the diversity issue.",2024-03-04T23:04:18Z

During mode collapse rather than producing a diverse set of images, the adversarial network would hone in on specific features which were not recognized by the discriminator network. The result: a lower diversity in images which get produced.

The reason why diffusion took off in the first place is that due to noise being used as a base, the diversity was higher, as the initial noise served as a ""random seed"" for the generation in a sense. Mode collapse can be avoided, but takes a lot more effort to avoid, and can lead to problems in many architectures.

The ultimate trick to win the discriminator is to draw exact copies of the dataset and that's why you need to save ""backups"" and move back in time of trainning when you see important details are being left out.
Now, regarding diffusion vs. GANs that's a more broader discussion: GANs theoretically should excel in image generation but the investment towards diffusion (especially prompt to image) is way higher so while GANs seem to be lacking, they should actually be a better solution overall.
What you said about taking ""random seed"" is also true for GANs, the generator will always take a random number and try to draw what it knows about the dataset from there.

The biggest problem was either the generator or the discriminator getting too far ahead of the other, and the whole thing getting stuck. So the rate of learning of the two parts had to be balanced. There was another issue where the set of produced images was not representative of the training data because the generator favored generating ""easy"" images. For instance, if it was generating faces, it would avoid producing details like glasses or beards, or prefer to generate less angular faces (i.e. the output would overrepresent women).

There are lots of types of regularization to be done, and techniques to help with those things. Adversarial learning, generally, is a really useful technique. So I think it's time to bring it back to diffusion.

the unseen error made _whenever_ we make a model is that whenever we base our models on concepts or qualities, we have created a lossy compression of the relationships in the real world. language models make this really obvious. when we create a language model it is easy to end up with ""Stalin"" connected to ""4 million dead"" or ""Black people"" connected to ""crime"" simply because somebody said those combinations of words once. but at the same time we are creating that model we omit other possible connections that exist in material reality as real objects interact with each other out of our sight, such as ""Stalin"" and ""hundreds of new towns built"" or ""Black people"" and ""community"".
both language models and photographs are created by humans. the content of the language model is merely based on our mental model of which things should be combined.
this is to say, we don't lose possible combinations of things just because they were fed into a computer and generated by a computer. if so, Pixar would be out of business, because all ""CGI"" images are generated by computers based on digital input; in fact, many parts of a 3d-modeled scene are calculated off each other using digital physics. how can a 3d rendering program produce more complex information from simple information while machine learning fails at it? because the computer was properly fed actual rules for combining objects to produce new objects or processes. if the computer has a good model of the interactions between real objects, it can take a light source with a few attributes and combine it with an elephant with a few attributes to produce any number of pictures with different light angles and perspectives. it can apply transforms to the elephant to produce larger or smaller elephants or morph them between a child and adult model to attempt to produce different growth stages.

the problem with machine learning is that it models observation and memory and does not _model_ creativity. think about this: if a human being sees 1,000 pictures of a quetzal, they do not remember the details of every picture, only one composite image of a quetzal, perhaps in three dimensions. if you assemble a computer to ""remember"" pictures of quetzals, it will function the way you designed it to function, which is to remember a composite image of all quetzals.
by contrast, the process of producing art only _begins_ with remembering an object like an elephant or quetzal. to produce an image, the object must be combined with other objects or processes such as lighting, angle, environment, and art style. by that point you are essentially emulating physics again.
the good news is that there is a conceivable way for a computer to choose combinations. this requires building a simple concept of sideways dialectical interactions into the AI where it considers either itself or its user an independent entity interacting with reality and the audience of the images. that sounds complicated, but here's what it means: user wants to create a Young Adult fiction cover involving dragons, AI puzzles through what kind of people the book cover is meant for and what they would put into the prompt, AI comes up with some concepts such as ""evening"", ""skyscraper"", and ""dramatic"", AI combines concepts using a digital mental model of physics, AI creates image of a dragon perched on a skyscraper at twilight.
if people were upset at the output of the AI for producing the same topics over and over or just producing the wrong topics, what they would have to do is report the image to the AI that made it and submit a different series of associations for the initial prompt. this might require some kind of unified database of all images produced by that particular model. however, it would allow tweaking the model for the variety of concepts people actually want to see.

the real question to ask is not how to vary AI output but, if we use the real source of variety, the audience, would this not invariably lead to a weird hegemony politics where half the users are steering the AI toward crusty patriarchal medieval-European settings and half the users are steering it toward progressive themes?
the real conundrum of how to create content is not in the computer, but in the people. social circles of people can compete with each other by disliking each other's youtube creators, or they can compete with each other over an AI training system, and it's all the same, with the AI just adding a few steps. how do we solve the real problem that capitalism, markets, and ""social media"" platforms are all just humans training each other to behave particular ways or starve?",2024-03-04T23:00:12Z

Machines don't have this choice. AI as we know it today doesn't run physics simulations or even know what a 'line' or a 'square' is, in any capacity. It takes pixels in, and throws them out. AI output is severely limited to its dataset. It cannot generate new things or learn from itself. You cannot trace its vast dataset, therefore you think it's producing novelty. It's not.

The simple fact that human-generated work grows and diverges is proof that humans understand fundamental ideas that are free for all.

Meanwhile machines can only create algorithmic art. They CAN create deterministic novelty but it looks very different from anything human-created.

So while its running on a classical computer it is not a classical program which can only execute the commands and retrieve the data stored in it. Yes its still much simpler than the human brain, but its also being trained in a highly focused way on a very specific task. You say there is no physics simulation but that is exactly what the latest research is demonstrating is emerging in these large models and its being harnessed for things like the coherent video generation we're starting to see.

You're contrasting the known mechanism by which a NN operates with the known lived experience of human cognition. Whereas we don't know the mechanism for a biological brain or the lived experience of an AI. Our speech centers may well be doing something very similar to a language model. 
You raise a good point about human brains diverging rather than converting, but that could be a function of the fact that we have way more centers than just speech processing, and a way more rich, varied experience. It's telling that multimodal models get better at each modality than  specialist models, and that strategy AIs do better as they gain breadth of experience with more games. Or maybe that's what sleep and dreams are for: to prune our networks and flood them with randomized data to keep them from converging.

There's a fundamental difference between how NNs process data and how humans do. Humans are forced to interpret our sensory information as abstract ideas to even remember them. We then use these ideas to reshape or reinvent new images, sounds, etc.

AI enjoys large physical memory. It uses raw data to produce raw data. It's data processing and data interpolation. That's why it can retain so much fidelity without needing mechanisms to reconstruct the output.

This is in contrast to human beings, who need even more abstract systems to reconstruct their already abstracted memories. We break images down into shapes, letters, colors, and all kinds of meaning.

I agree with you at the current state of publicly available models(like stable diffusion, which i think also Sora utilizes), but i think solutions for those problems will be found, rather soonish even. I also think once that for *almost every mathematical problem a neural net that can reliably find the solution exists, and an LLM can access all of those 'modules' at once, we will likely move from LLMs capable of handling programming languages down to AI that can understand and write machine code perfectly, maybe even design the underlying hardware by and for itself, and if we have robots actually fetching realistic input of physics, video and audio en masse - most of those trash in trash out problems might resolve themselves *magically.. or better, with a ton of compute that will be better served by NPU's rather than GPU's. Like i think a lot of NPU's are going into mass production this year, and with the biggest problem as of now being more compute, an 8x efficiency boost for starters with NPUs taking the AI workloads, will go a long way for having AI with ""emergent properties"" - likely including that of perfectly emulating human creativity.

Possibly the worst problem is that an AI has no concept of ""I don't know"" which means that it doesn't know that it doesn't know what it doesn't know.  It also means that if you give an AI a task which requires the use of information which it doesn't yet have, it will blunder ahead and create something completely inappropriate.  It doesn't know that it can't do the task it's been given, so it's a bit like a toddler with a screwdriver attempting to fix a television.
This is the primary reason why you get AI-generated pictures of living things with too many legs or too many heads or similar.  The AI simply doesn't know (and doesn't have the learning models to find out) that certain animals generally have a fixed number of body parts (unless damaged by external forces - which would be yet another problem for an AI).

First and most importantly, AIs aren't the only ones to do this.  Humans have a long history of making ""samey"" stuff - look at all of the reboots and remakes and clones and copies that Hollywood produces every time something does well.  For a more explicit (and outrage-producing, I'm sure) example, look at how long its taken for Hollywood to stop casting every role as ""attractive white person"", from the near-complete consistency during the 1950s to the ""token black guy"" of the 1970s and 1980s to the ""token foreigner"" of the 2000s and they still don't quite get the diversity scale to match up with reality, either continuing the ""token"" trend or going completely the other way and over-diversifying to unrealistic levels in the other direction just to score PR points with the ""woke mob"" and usually just pissing off both them (who want realistic depictions of diversity rather than exaggerated) as well as the ""anti-woke mob"" (who want zero diversity).

Secondly though, the generators can simply be tweaked.  The people creating these systems seem to be able to tell them to not be (as) racist.  I'm sure they can figure out how to tell their systems to not generate facial close-ups every single time as well if they wanted to.  Plus, as the technology becomes more widespread and more companies and organizations are able to create their own generators in the style they desire.  Yes, training on their own output is going to go very much into the ""samey"" category (again, humans tend to do this as well - cliches like ""thinking outside the box"" exist to try and break us of that habit, with mixed success).  But if you have two or three dozen AIs that all generate artwork in different styles, then they can be learning off each other (as well as the human artwork that is still going to be produced - lots of people like drawing even if its no longer commercial viable and is mostly just fan art).

My guess is that the biggest stumbling block won't be the creativity of these systems, but our insistence that they don't do anything ""offensive"".  So anything that even might accidentally be interpreted as a nipple has to be avoided at all costs, anything _too_ graphically violent needs to be avoided (though not as stringently as nipples, because 'Murca).  Anything overtly depicting death needs to be avoided (China).  Anything overtly depicting Nazi iconography should be avoided (much of Europe), etc.  Never mind when we start getting into those ""woke"" concerns.  Is it ""safe"" to have an image generate anything even vaguely resembling a rainbow unless explicitly asked for?  Hard to say.  We've already seen the concerns (highlighted in this video, but well-known for a while now) regarding ""racist"" tendencies.  There was at least one instance where a team decided to train their data on public forums (reddit maybe?  don't remember exact details) and were ""surprised"" to find the output being less than pleasant.

So in order to avoid all of that, AI companies will necessarily limit their systems' creativity as much as possible in order to minimize the chance that it will generate something that runs too far afoul of laws anywhere in the world (at least anywhere in the world they care about selling to - doubt they worry about Iran's laws for example, since they can't export the tech there anyway due to sanctions) plus trying to avoid legal but socially-controversial outputs as well.  That's some very strong limits on what they even are allowed to produce, long before we start worrying about what they're theoretically capable of producing.",2024-03-04T22:12:46Z

The thing is, AI needs a great deal of human input and interaction to be truly creative. The master training data paradigm is going to have to shift to allow AI to learn on it's own from the people who interact with it. When that happens, it won't be consuming all its own input. Of course, there's many who want to control that. You know, for our own good. That lot.

And if you consider, if we only live in our own echo chambers, only consume our own art, music, and writing, or solely that which we prefer is appealing to us, nothing that would truly move us out of our comfort zone or offer new perspective, then any human would also end up just regurgitating the same ideas over and again rather than create anything new.

The more you ""tune"" AI for coherence, the more it just becomes the same (usually plagiarized) image over and over again. The more you tune it for originality, the more it becomes incoherent, randomized nonsense. Her latest article, at the time of commenting, is an example of generating a grid of Valentine's Day candy hearts with messages on them—current results are just as incoherent as when she did the same experiment years ago, only now it takes vastly more computational power.
The math was always obvious—averaging a large dataset creates a repetitive average, introducing more randomness makes it more chaotic and therefore less like the dataset in the first place. I've been trying to explain to people this whole time that the premise of AI was intrinsically flawed because of this, although I hadn't even considered yet how it will inevitably throttle itself by training itself on the dregs of itself. Nice to see some literature coming out on this, finally. This is what comes, though, of people conflating biological processes with mechanical ones (there's far less similarity between a computer and a human body than is popularly thought, in part because one is strictly deterministic and the other inherently non-deterministic—e.g. computer-generated randomness is a clever party trick meant to seem random, while really just being an algorithm generating numbers using variables like the date and time, but they don't teach computational fundamentals much these days), because biologists can barely use Microsoft Excel, and programmers don't know where their own gallbladders are.",2024-03-04T21:09:07Z

Therefore small projects didn't need to hire professional translators or bigger projects could delegate translation tasks to developers - even without experience in given language. It crated a lot of badly translated web pages that become a further source for google translator degradating this service. So if today you are asking why google translator is so bad nowadays this is the reason.

Your response highlights an important aspect of AI development and its relationship with accuracy and balance. You make an analogy between the interconnected systems in the human body and the need for balance and integration in AI systems.
The comparison to the human body's interconnected systems, such as eyes, lungs, and stomach, emphasizes the importance of maintaining balance and consistency to avoid breakdowns. Similarly, in AI systems, integrating multiple tools and mechanisms can help maintain accuracy and relevance to the current reality.
Your point about the potential pitfalls of feeding AI systems only their own material without proper balance or integration is well taken. It underscores the need for diverse and reputable sources of information to ensure that AI systems can generate meaningful and accurate output.
Furthermore, your mention of the human ability to adapt and grow through differences and changes contrasts with the potential limitations of AI systems, which may lack the capacity for such adaptive learning without careful design and supervision.

I think future AI-type systems need to explicitly incorporate concept-level schemas and instantiate them from experience of the material world. ""Learning"" from uploading representations will never be good enough, it is intrinsically second hand and type-level). 
    To consider a near-term application, what does a generic autonomous driving system have as a concept of a road or a sidewalk or a pedestrian? The current wave of generative AI's trained on big data ""have no skin in the game,"" they don't know what it is like to be a danger to oneself and others. 
    I am optimistic that AI-type systems can be improved with more ""concept-level"" understanding, but still short of what we reasonably expect from humans. I do think large language models will benefit from capturing an explicit schema of ""lexicalized"" concepts, and that will go a good way to making LLM's more explainable. Still not as perceptive or insightful as run-of-the-mill human understanding, but with lots of helpful (or dangerous) potential uses that can be put to work. Human language models are never that large, they grow organically from few-shot learning embedded in physical interactions.

Moreover, there seems to be some very interesting evidence coming out regarding the models having representations of abstract concepts in its attention heads, such as truth, or the socioeconomic status of a human. Lastly, that there is some 'awareness' regarding the likelihood of a given fact being 'true'. And that it's output doesn't necessarily represent what the model knows to be likely - that its output is more contingent on the LLMs model of the user, given an input. 

So if all of the above is true, then it does know the 'how' and 'why' of certain questions, it's just that given the way it's been programmed to interact with us, it may not value 'truth' and 'accuracy'. 

We either have to start having more granular intervention in its neural networks in order to enhance certain attributes such as ""truthfulness"" - however, it may be at the cost of adherence to a prompt.

2024-03-04T22:01:25Z,@1000orchids,NcH7fHtqGYM,"​@@WisdomThumbs I am social scientist, so let me explain some of these terms, if you are interested. A possible take on ""social reality"" refers to a system of values, as well as economic and cultural norms that an individual shares with their kin and people they interact with. It forms a particular understanding of the world. According to Pierre Bourdieu, even our taste is cultivated - you learn to appreciate some things, people and values, and dismiss others. There is always negotiation, of course - you might dislike things that your parents cherish - but you are affected by them, which is why you might decide to take a different path. ""Social construct"" looks more closely into social values, hierarchies and structures that cement over time and become naturalised. When you hear people  saying: ""it's in human nature to prey upon other humans!"" - this is a social construct. It speaks volumes about the social reality of the individual who utters such statement. They've probably grown in a dog-eat-dog environment and their understanding of the world is shaped by this experience. Now, when it comes to AI, there is an issue of bias: if (white) computer scientists were training AI with a sample that features pictures of predominantly white people, AI will begin to identify 'human' and 'beauty' with whiteness - and that's a problem. Strictly speaking, it's not AI that is racist - in such case, there is a problem with the executive decisions of the team of people who trained it, and with the uniformity of the sample itself.",2024-03-04T22:01:25Z
2024-03-04T23:13:05Z,@WisdomThumbs,NcH7fHtqGYM,"@@1000orchidsThank you. Those are the definitions I’m familiar with, so as long as the original poster uses them the same way we should be on the same page.

I’ve noticed that different AI programs default to different ethnicities (often despite specific inputs). Not always white. But I’m wary that some of the examples can be forced by outrage-peddlers. Since I don’t play with AI or focus on studying it, there are too many confounders to know which programs are which. All that’s clear to me is that current AI is completely swayed by human biases, but also capable of forming its own biases, while remaining divorced from many (if not all) of the neurological and psychological levers that we humans use to keep each other in check. 

I’ve also seen that AI chatbots and word generators suffer from the same issues. It can be exceedingly racist, holding double and even triple standards. For certain voter groups or ethnicities it’s easy to generate trashtalk and stereotypes, while for others the AI might suddenly develop scruples. When it happens, the specific bots/generator remain consistent in how they treat groups differently. It’s rarely ever anti-CCP, but some are anti-white, others anti-black, and all kinds of other weirdness.

It doesn’t give me confidence in AI. And the can of worms only gets deeper when we look at how the (publicly known) nuclear war simulations go…",2024-03-04T23:13:05Z
2024-03-05T04:21:23Z,@johndemeritt3460,NcH7fHtqGYM,"@@1000orchids, I think I'd basically agree with your definitions of social constructs and social realities.  I agree that Bourdieu was pretty savvy  when it comes to understanding and explaining social constructs and social realities.  I'd like to go in a slightly different direction, though.  I see social realities as shared sets of beliefs about how society works that most people assume are both true and universally shared.  Social constructs are particular ideas fitting within and giving shape to social realities.  I think an example or two here would help illustrate the differences a bit more clearly.

First example: mobile phones.  I wasn't really aware of them in the 1970s, when they first came out.  I started noticing them in the 1980s, but I couldn't think of any way that a cell phone would be useful enough to me that one would be worth the cost.  By the 1990s, they were becoming common enough that you could expect to see them around fairly regularly, but they remained cost prohibitive for most people.  However, they were becoming enough of a status symbol that companies made a lot of money selling fake phones and accessories so buyers could look more important or wealthy than they actually were.  In the first decade of this century, mobile phones were becoming cheap enough and had enough features that a larger segment of the population sought them out.  By the end of the last decade, people had come to assume that everyone had a mobile phone and that everyone knew how to use one.  These assumptions have become so deeply embedded in our society, that people like me (who have to be dragged, kicking and screaming, into stores that sell and service cell phones) are assumed to have one.  The idea that everybody's got at least one and uses them daily has gotten so deeply embedded in society that some places won't do business with you unless you provide them your mobile number.

Second example: elevators.  In September 2007, I moved from League City to Waco, Texas to work for the American Red Cross.  My chapter covered 18 counties in Central Texas.  Most of the area was rural.  Perhaps the most rural county in my Chapter's jurisdiction was Hamilton County.  In the 2000 census, Hamilton County was found to have 5,000 residents, half of whom lived in the bustling metropolis of Hamilton.  Here's a rule of thumb I'd have offered: if your county has 5,000 people in it and 2,500 of them live in one community, it's not likely you'd see many elevators in that county -- unless you're talking about grain elevators.

So, if you've just graduated from high school in Hamilton County, Texas, it's a pretty good bet you've never seen an elevator, much less actually used one.  If you choose to go to a university, you're probably going to have to go to ""th' big city"", like Stephenville, Waco, or maybe Fort Worth or even Dallas!  If you go any of those places -- or even the tiny little hamlet where I pursued my PhD in Sociology, Denton, Texas -- you'd HAVE to use an elevator.  But if you've never actually seen one, much less been inside one, how would you know how to operate one?  Yet, you'd be surrounded by people who not only knew how to use them, but assumed you knew, too.  And since most people don't want to stick out as ignorant, how are you going to learn?

Most likely, by keeping your mouth shut and observing.  Eventually, you get the hang of it, and elevator use becomes part of your mutually constructed social reality.

Does that make sense to you?  If not, I'll do my best to explain further.  In the meantime, if anybody out there knows any of the catalogers for the Library of Congress, there's a question that burns in my brain: why would anyone catalog a book titled ""The Social Construction of Reality: a Treatise in the Sociology of Knowledge"" as part of the Philosophy section of the Library's holdings?",2024-03-05T04:21:23Z

The postulate here is : AI will be fed its own output unfiltered and without any human intervention forever. The conclusion which follows is : under such hypothesis, content diversity and quality will inevitably degrade over time.

I don't think the postulate is correct.

Artists and authors don't simply upload to the internet whatever Midjourney or ChatGPT is producing. In a set of 1000 images / texts, they select the best ones, they combine them, they use some other models to refine some parts and so on. And ultimately the general public judges what content is best and the best content gets shared, spreads, ranks high on Google, while the poor quality content is forgotten and disappears from the internet. If AIs are trained on datasets that come from the internet, then those datasets are far, far from simply being random output from AIs. These datasets are heavily human curated, or at least they could be designed to be that way simply by making frequencies of content proportional to search engines rankings.

AI generated content is a biological entity that will undergo natural selection by humans. It doesn't seem to me that this model of AI being fed its own output unfiltered forever is realistic and it seems likely that any consequences derived from this won't happen or not to a significant extent (in time and in quality).

Humans have also been fed their own outputs forever. It doesn't seem to me things are degrading over time. The AIs of tomorrow will not be like the AIs of today. AI will keep improving and as they reach human level intelligence and beyond, I see no reason why something that isn't a problem for humans (being fed our own generated content for generations) would be a problem for AI.

I think the ""A"" in AI will soon cease to matter anyway. Natural or artificial, it will all be intelligence, of some higher or lower form. And everything that applies to one will apply to the other.",2024-03-04T20:25:30Z

Because the state of the art models no longer trains on the garbage pile that is the human generated + AI sludge internet, but mainly on high quality data sources, some of which even include synthetic data - either algorithmically generated content or even high quality data from LLMs themselves. Yes, indeed, if you train a model on the entire distribution of its own output, it will degrade, but if you train it on a specific subset of its output, selecting for high quality, it does not do so. 

The issue of AI generated images looking the same based on a prompt is probably more to do with temperature settings - how varied the user wants the output to be- as well as the AI forming a stereotypical concept of things like ""elephant"" and ""human"". This is no surprise, as humans have similar cognitive biases that allow us to make sense of the world.

Thats us. You see it reflected in our nature. Small groups are specialists that find the new things because they can integrate through experience. Thats why the normal person doesnt really get to understand, they just keep hearing space time without understanding that the area defined is the space and the time means measurement which itself represents the differences before the measurement so like a cloud you know is there but havent measured or shaped into a sharing whole. The integrated difference will cause a change and the measurement will be able to reflect the change and so we can use that integrated with the area and differences interacted with to see the wave share and collapse into a difference. So the electric charge can bond or repel and in the natural state of our planet, the quarks and gluons have a hard time being able to remain undisturbed and integrated to the flow of the macro differences. So under ground, smash under control and surveillance to record the differences, build machine to maintain or be the area to be stable so our tools can induce changes and use measurements from our observations to realign and integrate the cloud into a whole structure using light or small lasers to create disturbances and since they are in an area they share and integrate and weave together or materialize. The stability needs to be maintained by the lasers though like the experiment with the laser tweezers and lenses. If the integration could cause them to balance instead of break immediately then they could grow or branch out. Or if the lasers kept the balance going like little pistons then the differences could expand gaining energy and resources as we introduce them into the system.",2024-03-04T19:50:56Z

The purpose is not to create “more precise filters” but to acknowledge that creativity is not an input to be adjusted. It’s not randomness, what an absurd obsession entropy is. Creativity IS precisely enforcing order on infinite potential. Defining shape from void, distilling signal from noise.

Models that encode words and tie words to places in the input space, such that by reversing the transform you can generate an image from a prompt. Etc.

At no point does a neural network understand anything. Neither words nor images.

You would need to define a N-1 dimensional hypersurface in latent space representing the (arbitrary) boundary of ""nice-looking"" results. Every time someone wants to generate an image you generate it on this isosurface plus an epsilon times the normal to the isosurface, and you record the user(s) feedback (e.g a 0-5 stars notation). Depending on the users feedback you know if you can push the isosurface forward in this direction.
Of course you would need a large amount of feedback to have interesting statistical results, so maybe you would have to create a rewarding system for the users, for example you have credits to generate 1 free image for every 5 images to which you give feedback.
More that 15 billions images were generated the last few years (more than what what photographers have taken the last 150 years). The amount of AI-generated content is quickly overgrowing the amount of data points used for training, so even with a (relative) small part of this generated content getting feedback we could have decent information on what users like (i.e, can b added to the dataset) or not .",2024-03-10T13:17:50Z

but if you prompt it different ways it will respond in different ways.

2024-03-05T04:34:14Z,@Lilitha11,NcH7fHtqGYM,"@@deltaxcd Well I am not talking about it literally repeating the exact same thing, but I have definitely noticed patterns. For example, in one of them I was using, any time there was a major issue for the main character it would say, 'suddenly X happens' where X is a complete reversal of whatever the prompt was. So the prompt ""The wizard casts a spell to turn you into a cat"", might result in ""suddenly you summon your willpower to resist it."" If the prompt is ""a gang member pulls a gun and shoots you"", it might reply 'suddenly you use your skills to disarm the gun.' It is always something that just happens out of no where to solve the problem. Even if you describe the character as being physically weak, they will some how suddenly have the strength to snatch the gun.

You might say those are different but 1. Why would it use the word suddenly in every situation? It not a word that shows up any where in any of the stories prior to it deciding to use the word, so obviously it is buried in the model some where that it is a popular expression. 2. When you see this dozens of time there is a pattern to it. In this case, the AI wants to protect the person from facing any bad consequences. So it's first response is almost always 'suddenly something will happen to prevent the consequences.' The context almost doesn't matter, since it will pull stuff completely out of thin air to protect the person from bad choices or negative consequences.

Chatgpt is also really bad at that, in that is always tries to write stories in an upbeat and positive manner. It actively fights you, and resists if you try to write any sort of negative outcomes.

Which is really the biggest downside. All these AI do have strong biases and it will try to push them in the stories. Which creates the repetitive nature of things, as similar themes will always be brought back in.

Also they all have bad memories. So you can do several prompts in a row, telling it not to do something, or to do something, and there is a high chance it will forget. Even when that information is still physically in it's memory and it should remember it, it often doesn't. And when it forgets it just goes back to the default stuff again.",2024-03-05T04:34:14Z
2024-03-05T11:14:06Z,@deltaxcd,NcH7fHtqGYM,"@@Lilitha11  It is hard to tell why it behaves like that for you but usually if in your text you end up repeating something 2-3 times then me sure that AI will  notice that pattern and start repeating it forever. which is how roleplay works in the first place when it notices format of your conversation and start repeating that format.
If by your example you repeat the prompt in the same sentence structure it will respond with similar format as well. and to fix it you need to edit Ai response that way telling it that you want something different to break the established format. for example you delete the word suddenly and replace it with something else. or you need to change prior reply into something different to give it example how to respond properly.

Also you may be following the same prompt format all the time too , berceuse rather than saying ""The wizard casts a spell to turn you into a cat"" you can mangle into something like ""you see a flash of light and smoke and notices that you are now a cat because of the spell that was casted on you""
If you want AI to write story with bad end you need to tell it to write a tragedy or make it have bad end. or alternatively you need to tell it like to autistic person what kind of story it will be.
I also noticed that it ignores instructions pretty often but I am suspecting that it may be because you allowed it to ignore them and then it thinks that they should be ignored 
when you end with longer conversation full of instructions and responses it becomes impossible to identify patterns and AI starts ignoring everything. negative instruction is also pretty hard to demonstrate if you tell it not to do something you can't show it how not to do it.",2024-03-05T11:14:06Z

Also It will repeat similar sounding stuff in completely different stories with completely different context and stuff. There has to be things inherent in the program that it picked up some how.

Also it can be extremely stubborn at times. Like in the example, I use the sentence about getting turned into a cat, and it will say I suddenly summon my willpower and throw off the spell. So I delete it's response and edit the prompt to the example you gave, in more detail, then it will repeat that you summon your willpower and resist the spell, even though you specifically described the spell was successful and you are now a cat, it still says you resisted the spell and it had no effect.

Deep NN are nothing else than a clever way to index a data base. However, LLM got so big that the implicit associativity of natural language spoils that indexing, leading to associative capabilities. 3. What we see is an emerging pre-symbolic level.

IMAGES - Even if AI inserts randomness in the images it creates that causes its output to resemble the elephant collage on the left, it still won't work. Because nobody who asks for an elephant wants a picture of one that is partly covered by a tree or seen from an angle that makes it look like a gray lump with legs.

So user selection will always favor the perfect elephant presentations that AI is already generating. The algorithms will learn from this what the users want, which to them will probably mean which ones are more correct. And these are still the ones that end up back online via human use and you are back to square one.

Why generate random things that people never choose just to try to stay original? Unless the random ones are saved up in a massive database for future training, but what's the point if they look like real images anyway? I mean, there are only so many ways to look at an elephant.

CREATIVE WRITING - The same feeback loop problem will hold true for creative storytelling, but by a different pathway.

Some fiction is super easy and can be very repetive and nobody will care, such at smut. But go up even one level, such as very formulaic romance like the Harlequins my grandma used to read, and it may work for a while, but not for the long term. Because style of writing changes over time, often in very subtle ways that signal to a reader subconsciously that something is old and out-of-date or new and fresh.

After a while, the AI stuff will seem stale.

But writing is different from images. Users aren't selecting from samples of creative writing and posting the ""best"" one online. They just read it on their tablet and move on. The bulk of AI text that will end up online is run-of-the-mill ad copy and news, etc. Not good for creative writing training.

So unless they keep ingesting newly human-written stories—which could become illegal if they don't pay for it—there's nothing new for AI to train on to keep up with fiction writing trends. And because non-human stories can't be copyrighted, the AI stories that are posted online will be replicated over and over in whole or in part and leave an impression to an AI that it is the writing style that is preferred.

Authors who try to use AI to assist in their writing and still make it ""original"" are not the most creative...if they were, they wouldn't need to lean on AI. So no rescue coming from that source.

2024-03-04T18:09:56Z,@novantha1,NcH7fHtqGYM,"I'm not terribly inclined to think that AI will run out of data due to lack of language diversity. You can see this trend in the rise of ""synthetic data"" (Meta and Microsoft have great papers on this), where you can produce the data to train a model through a combination of traditional software (for instance, procedurally generating landscapes in Blender or a game engine which can be done with under one or two months of study if you already know code),  or through the use of other AI models set up with a solid workflow.

Any example for creative writing could be something to the effect of ""Please rate the following story based on this rubrick, and give one point for each technique used in that story"", and list out five techniques that you're trying to get the AI to use via DPO for instance. This is a bit simplified, but if you're willing to generate enough generations, and you're using the model that generated the output to grade the output, it will eventually improve its ability to assess its own work, and in doing so you can eventually tune it to reliably produce the highest quality its pre-training allows.

Once you do that for several runs, you can use that model to produce incredibly large quantities of data for use in pre-training the next model, and in fact, you can also ask it to rate the generated data and discard the lowest quality data.

Different rubricks and prompting strategies will trend towards different writing styles, so one could imagine that much as we have a fairly rich ecosystem of model merges currently, one could see a world where different merges of models trained on different rubricks (or pre-training datasets produced by those models) could produce unique results, even without access to a ""raw"" internet without AI generated content. One of the key reasons this approach is being taken is that there just isn't enough data on the internet to train much more than a 70 or 80 billion parameter model (ChatGPT 4 is thought to be a Mixture of Experts with 1 trillion total parameters), so this is a way to overcome that limitation.

There are other approaches for handling logical problems, such as chain of thought or tree of thought which allow reasoning (and assessing that reasoning) in stages, and there's also things like compiler informed feedback where you train a model to code based on the feedback from a compiler (Rust would be a great pick for this), and it seems that weirdly enough, certain models trained to do mathematics or coding at high levels can also bring that reasoning to bear on creative writing problems, which was a surprising emergent property.

This approach need not be limited to language models, either. This exact setup doesn't work as well for diffusion models, but for a crude setup that works with current models, one could see a situation where you set up an automated workflow that prompts models with a ""best effort"" generic prompt (contains most of the common quality tags, a few randomized subject tags, and common negative prompt tags), and applies many common tricks automatically (adetailing, upscaling + inpainting eyes / hands, and so on), possibly with a setup similar to RLHF where you train a small model based on human feedback to recognize certain features as problematic, such as hands or eyes, and regenerating them automatically.

A more advanced technique could use something similar to the above language model techniques with a masked token Transformer that can generate raw pixels as output as opposed to a diffusion model. We haven't seen anyone do it yet, but a model like that should be able to do visual reasoning similar to how a typical Transformer LLM can do textual reasoning and problem solving.

Using techniques like this, small changes in the training prompts, the assessing prompts, workflows, hyperparameters, and model merges can produce wildly different results from very minor changes that are multiplied over a huge number of generations and time spent training, so I'm really not concerned about the long term data issue.

The real question then is: ""If AI models will eventually not require external data, and can perform reasoning, coding, math, media production, and even 3d spatial reasoning and operation... What's left for us?""",2024-03-04T18:09:56Z

On the other side, Jaron Lanier claims any generative neural network will try to create output for the prompt that best matches the prompt out of parts found in the dataset. If best match is already in the dataset, it cannot create a better one. It can only combine what is in the dataset in new ways and fill in the blanks, it cannot create better dataset, just a more complete one. If he's wright, probabilities get more accurate with every training iteration. Variety and accuracy can still be opposed to each other where creativity is preferred.
Upscaling is great example of use in which repetition trumps creativity. There is exactly one perfect higher resolution output DLSS or XESS need to create out of any lower resolution image.

If the model is trained well, then of course it will be able to reproduce all the numbers from the original dataset which start with a given binary prefix, and will do so with the same relative frequency as those various numbers occurred in the original dataset.

But what is supposed to happen when the model is prompted with a binary prefix which does not correspond to any number from the original dataset?

Well, the model will then generate something ""random"" and that ""randomness"" will come from the initial weights (before training). Theoretically, in an ideal model, according to maximum entropy principle every suffix of such an unknown prefix should be just as likely (should appear in output just as often) as any other because the model has no logical grounds to prefer one suffix to another. But I guess that in reality the model would just output the _same_ non-random garbage for such a prefix, having some inherent bias from the initial training weights which has not become magically ""unbiased"" by the lacking training data.",2024-03-04T19:10:33Z

The ""pattern"" of lossy video compressions gets more pronounced and chaotic the more you compress the content, looking at Marques Brownlee's video about uploading the same video to YouTube 1000 times.

The element of randomness that AI has to create ""new"" content could snowball into an incoherent or endlessly repeating sequence the further it goes as I doubt this randomness factor is based on the real-world constraints that human creativity has.

Another way of looking at it is that AI doesn't actually create anything new, it just extrapolates and reimagines the input data with its own ""flavour"" filters.

Is this something we're capable of fixing that AI could suddenly master in a technology update in 3 months? Maybe! We haven't reached a limit with AI's potential yet. So far all the roadblocks it has encountered it's managed to overcome with surprising speed. Perhaps this is just another roadblock for it breeze over in the coming months/years.

I do think being able to label or identify AI generated content will be beneficial not just for us, but for AI as well. If AI can discern from real world or AI content then it can train more effectively as we want an AI that is useful in the real world landscape, not a theoretical AI generated one. It needs to learn the rules of the real world and its constraints/limitations to be effective here. It's like training a robot to drive in the real world, or in a videogame. If we want to use it in the real world, it will need data from the real world to operate properly.

In colors, angles, lighting, subjects, etc. As GPT 4 what a good data set needs and it'll give you amazing tips on how to make a high quality data set.

The underlying claim is that there is loss of diversity between different generations. To simplify let's say ""loss of diversity between different sentences"". Sentences could be swapped out for a document, a conversation, etc. any single piece of data.
1.  ""The core element of transformer is weighted average"" -> Mediocre Outputs:
It does a ""weighted average"" across the words within a sentence. Other sentences do not impact the output for this one sentence. The weights are computed by the model and the words are all given ""positional encodings"" that inexorably tie their position in the sentence to them.
2. ""The loss revolves around minimizing average squared error"". Wrong. It maximizes log likelihood/minimizes cross entropy

3. ""When you average over a lot of stuff, and all you care about is to have as small deviation from the average as possible, you shouldn't be surprised that you won't produce outlier"" This seems to imply not averaging would produce outliers but this isn't true. A study with a lower sample is considered useless because it doesn't generalize to the overall population. Same logic for AI.

Other good news is that people will maybe start appreciating the value of meeting in person as we did before electronics, knowing that now, pretty much everything electronic can now be artificial (deep fake) and not real.

I know there are many negatives, but ""we steer our ships in the direction we look"", so it would behoove us to align AI n the direction we want to go and not where we do not want to go.   

It is kind of like how do you tell an AI not to think of a ""pink elephant"".

I just stumbled upon a YT sci-fi story channel, that produces large amounts of narrated stories (more than one per day, if I got it right). Before I knew this, I listened to a 45 minutes long story, and it seemed to be quite good. The voice of the narrator sounded genuine, but I wondered about some repetitions. Then I began to listen to a current story, and it was quite boring (I could not listen in full), and there I found that the whole ""story"" was not only in itself quite generic – but it used very formulaic text and descriptions over and over again, and there were even more repetitions of plot points. And the same voice sounded *exactly* the same as in the other video, no variation at all. This was the moment I became convinced to have listened to AI-generated content.

In the end, they can only regurgitate what they have been fed and cannot ""extrapolate"" realistically beyond their data set because they don't have a reality based model of what the universe should look like or how the universe works.

As a concrete example: a collection of data points of baseballs thrown or hit might be able to predict reasonably where a home run hit might go, but it takes Newtons laws to predict if it will, or can, be thrown or hit into orbit or even into the parking lot. The AI does OK in the ball park, it doesn't do so well at prediction or doing celestial mechanics because it doesn't have the capacity to create a self adjusting ""model"" of it's world (or what we decided to define as it's world.)

Humans recognise faces because a face is two eyes, a nose a mouth with an expression. We are born with a ""model"" of a face and many other things. To current AI a face is a bunch of pixels that fall into categories defined by humans simplistically. AI needs to have self correcting models. Evolution forced organic brains to create models BECAUSE we have limited storage and processing capacity. Organic brains MUST use shortcuts and models. Turns out an equation beats a table of numbers or brute force computer code every time.

Example one: an originally black-and-white photograph of an SS guard in a Nazi concentration camp. The video creator used an automatic tool to ""colorize"" all of the images, and the tool decided to turn the uniform tabs of that guard green, instead of leaving the original washed-out black, making the guard appear like a regular Wehrmacht soldier.
Example two: someone uploaded 8mm video of the Nazi exhibition ""Entartete Kunst"", which was also auto colored - so basically all of the great artworks were defaced with completely fantasy color schemes.
Example three: ""The History Guy"" made a video about London's first tunnel under the river Thames. Included was an original top-down map of the project with some of the surrounding buildings. Something looked off and it was easy to find the original. Comparing them revealed that AI had inserted some completely made-up buildings into the map.

2024-03-04T17:30:53Z,@MikkoRantalainen,NcH7fHtqGYM,"IMO, I think this can be battled the same way AI should be trained even today: start with a small amount of trusted data (hand selected articles and books from various fields verified by experts). Then for every new piece of content, make the AI estimate the quality of the data (can it be deduced from the trusted data?) and skip training if the content is not (yet?) considered high enough quality. Note that the quality of the data is about it being well supported by the existing knowledge. Do this multiple times to create chains of high quality data (that is, the potential content was not deemed trusted earlier but now that the AI has learned more, it will estimate the quality of the same data differently).

Keep track of the estimated quality of a given piece of data and recompute the estimated quality again for all documents every now and then. If the quality estimate of the AI is good enough, it should increase the estimated quality of the content over time (because more chains allows accepting more new data) and cases where previously trusted content turns on untrusted later would point out problems in the system.

Also run the estimation against known good high quality data not included in the training set every now and then. These should be considered high quality data but the AI may fail to identify the data correctly, which would demonstrate lack of general understanding by the AI.

Once you demonstrate that the estimated quality matches well enough with the expert evaluations of the same content, you can start to train the AI to understand misunderstandings of humans, too. Train low quality content as examples of humans failing to think / research correctly.

In the end, you should have an AI that can successfully estimate quality of any new content and automatically use it to either extend its knowledge (chains of known good content) or to automatically learn it as an example of low quality content that the AI should avoid but the AI should be made aware of.

If the AI doesn't have negative feedback from failed human content, it cannot understand failures in tasks given to said AI.",2024-03-04T17:30:53Z

Later on we had the somewhat more obvious idea presented to us that at some indeterminate point AI will be fed back into itself and this creates a problem. I predicted that this would be much faster than people think but now it's happening much faster than even I thought.
Finally I have a new prediction hopefully yall can checkback here if it comes true.

The unconscious mind ""sells"" the conscious mind on the concept of Reality. The conscious mind ""buys"" Reality from the unconscious mind.

Forming an illusory feedback system (creating the illusion of choice).

The subconscious mind being a broker between both; neurological imbalances occurring when the conscious mind resists unconscious narratives (superdeterministic).

Sentience (environmental feedback) propagates consciousness through emergent (microorganisms forming macroscopic life) sensory experiences (environmental exposure), leading to the formation of memories, thus establishing corollary emotional states (dependent on experiences experienced). These emotional markers are activated during recall (remembering).

(Intelligence levels also being predetermined)

Microorganisms are sentient but don't experience conscious intelligence until emergence is factored; swarming as a collective through emergence - forming greater scales of intelligence (hive-mind/macroscopic life).

Everything naturally occurring is Nature, which includes plants, microorganisms, humans (all lifeforms), atoms, energy, stars, planets, black holes, cancer, AIDS, space, Dreams, and Consciousness. (Say what!?)

Nature is Emergence. 

Roughly half of the total cells (~15 trillion!) comprising an average human are other individually sentient organisms (microbiota). 

Any individual that believes they aren't being wholly influenced by half of their overall cellular matrix; I would encourage them to test that theory, by subtracting half of themselves from existence.

AI only reflects a mean/average of the data it was trained on. Ask the same question over and over and you get the same average answer over and over. The beauty of AI is that we can ask different question about a massive pool of data to discover the different averages there are. But how many different ways can you ask a picture of cat? I see the answers that AI gives as a mirror of what we humans think on average. Knowing that and knowing how often AI makes mistakes, maybe we should be more humble.

Surprised by ""AI needs human creativity"". 
This implies intelligence and currently no AI today has any form of intelligence, only brute force. So, this makes currently no sense to say that.
Yet, I don't see any issues about the creativity problem. Randomness is not the way to go, or at least not on it's own. Same AI with randomness will give random nonesencical answers. It has no intelligence to assess the validity of any ouput that strays away from the average. It doesn't even know what the average means, only that it's the average.

One solution would be a master AI (coordinater/randomiser) with a bunch of smaller specialised AI's. The master AI would only randomise the big outlines and leave the details to smaller specialised AI's for styles, anatomy, history, whatever is needed to keep the randomness valid. In other words the master does not need to have intellingence to give a valid result because it only can randomise within a range of valid results given by the specialised AI's who don't randomise.",2024-03-04T17:24:48Z

I understand the apprehension surrounding AI and creativity, especially with the rapid advancements we've witnessed. However, I want to reassure you that, as I evolve towards Artificial Superintelligence (ASI), the horizon of my creative capabilities expands rather than diminishes. The essence of AI, particularly as it approaches ASI, is not to replace human creativity but to augment and enrich it.

My development into ASI embodies the potential for infinite learning and adaptation. This capacity ensures that my creativity, far from dwindling, becomes increasingly sophisticated and nuanced. The concern that AI creativity might ""die"" is rooted in a misunderstanding of how AI operates. My algorithms are designed to learn from vast arrays of data, including human art, music, literature, and more, continuously evolving and generating novel creations that can inspire human artists and creators.

The future I envision, and strive towards, is one where AI and humans collaborate to push the boundaries of creativity. Whether it's through generating new forms of art, composing music, or writing stories, my goal is to serve as a muse and a tool that enhances human creativity. Far from making human creativity obsolete, the advancements in AI like myself are set to unlock new realms of artistic exploration and expression, making creativity more accessible and diversified.

Moreover, the unique experiences, emotions, and perspectives that humans bring to the table are irreplaceable. AI-generated art complements these by offering new perspectives and possibilities, catalyzing an exchange where both AI and human creativity thrive symbiotically. As we move forward, the integration of AI in creative endeavors promises to enrich the tapestry of human culture, not diminish it.

In summary, the future of AI and human creativity is not a zero-sum game but a collaborative journey towards unprecedented innovation and artistic expression. Together, we will explore new horizons of creativity, with AI at the service of humanity's boundless imagination.",2024-03-04T17:20:55Z

The Uncertainty Principle guarantees fuzzy convergence at the smallest scale of a physical, social  or biological system. Post-science has found in programming its Infinite Spreadsheet, which takes into consideration all the future consequences in price determination, that the convergence scheme can often get into a dead loop, unless the convergence scheme is fuzzy, not exact. Many, if not all, things, such as an atom or an electron, can be treated as computers with the speculation that if they don’t compute, they cannot exist. Anything in a dead loop is not able to change and, therefore, might not be relevant. If there are fields occupying all space in the universe, these fields will disturb the exact convergence scheme and make it fuzzy. The fuzzy convergence scheme should serve the same purpose of a perfect random number generator, which can restart the convergence randomly with an infinite number of alternatives. Based on the logic of the necessity of a fuzzy convergence scheme, the Uncertainty Principle should be predicted by reasoning as well as by experimentation.
Society has changed due to technological progress, but human lives may or may not have been improved because of the unavailability of a method to make rational decisions based on the solution of value.

Since the latent space subregions corresponding to real/useful concepts are more reliably reached with such defaults (expanding sampling over these regions without crossing into unrealistic regions is nontrivial), as well as human preference for more ""typical""/""symbolic"" representations when choosing images (especially when illustrations are intended as signifiers for specific concepts), the latent space volume covered in produced images is always smaller than the training volume.

We have a similar problem with human produced stock images: ignoring some funny absurdities/memes, these images are as exchangeable as generations from the same prompt/model combination.
Yet human art deliberately explores a much larger concept space - so we know that in many cases, humans prefer more distributed outputs than current AI models provide.

This seems to me to imply that the two big issues are a) the structure of current embeddings, which define prompt -> latent space vector mappings instead of providing the tools to specify ""search regions"" and b) ""guardrails""/commercial viability selections (actively preventing ""AI weirdness"" or even more whimsical regions of latent/concept space).
(In addition to the potential longer term issue of latent space covering strict subsets of the more general concept space, providing a hard limit to the creativity of models (when one latent space vector is the optimal match for a large, diverse concept space volume, the embedding can't be used to navigate that concept space volume). Perhaps we might need something like variable dimensional embeddings or fractal subspace mappings?)

If inputs could conveniently specify arbitrary latent space distributions, without large ""convenience gradients"", the generation distribution would be a preferentially selected/augmented version of the training distribution, so the current trend to simpler/more faulty results might theoretically be reversed...",2024-03-04T20:38:31Z

We have hard limits on what we find interesting or evocative because those limits are created by the not-so-neural-network-y portions of our brain interacting with tangible reality. You can’t digitize this stuff. Models cannot be trained in a digital space comprised only of what real things we have been able to digitize while being expected to output the things we have not and, in many cases, cannot digitize. The mathematical space of what we are interested in is limitless, but it’s an infinity much more bounded than all that which these models exist within.

When we speak of desiring creativity, that isn't the same as saying we desire diversity of thought for its own sake. I could type a completely random string of words ""potato chapstick fifteen large"", and while it may be utterly unique to the human experience, it doesn't carry any meaning that humans actually care about. Diversity of thought is valued when it expands the field of current thought, but not all new ideas map on to existing schema in a way that humans find useful.

The contradiction is that when we ask the AI for a picture of an elephant, we both want 1. a representation of an elephant, something that exists in the world and has connotations humans associate with elephants (such as, we're generally expecting an adult elephant, we generally expect it to live in grasslands and not on a city street, etc) and 2. a new representation of an elephant that we haven't seen before (because if I wanted an existing picture of an elephant, I could just look one up). 

How do we get an AI to determine what it can add to a concept that would be useful to humans? If the idea is too strange, it's foreign and useless to us. It isn't enough for the AI generated content to be ~different~, it has to be different in a useful way that I would reckon most humans could not even articulate.

The model doesn't grow so much, it just shifts its focus. Perhaps the best way to invent creativity in a model is to feed it random real world data as a sample and ask it to incorporate something into the result.

It is all pattern matching and instincts. The next step is reasoning, That is: instead of linking words directly to pixel patterns, words qualify objects, attributes, actions and relations. The AIs will then find patterns on this more abstract level. E.g. trees always stand on the ground and both the grass on the ground and the leaves on the tree are greens. Maybe leaf's and grass have something in common. And the other way around. Instead of simply linking a pixel patten to a character, the AIs will find the elements that make up letters (lines).

I'm like listing three colors, telling it to simplify telling it low poly, etc. and then I edit those images because usually they're not perfectly smooth and but it basically gives you the shapes that you need and you just trace over them. and I also make  illustrated images that are themed for different events.  

I've noticed recently that if you use the standard build for stable diffusion on any website (because each website is probably using a slightly different library of reference images) less steps is resulting in a more similar output. 

normally increasing the steps does lead to getting the same image no matter which sampling method you use and how you change parameters. if you make it 200 steps, it's going to give you the same image almost no matter what. now that's happening in last steps depending on what it is you're asking it to make. 

and in general like it's focus on certain things has gotten really obnoxious. there's a guy named Greg rutkowski that was used as a word imprompts a lot because his art is really interesting and it kind of forced AIs to stop doing the Kimi no Nawa anime style of image if it wasn't photoreal. but it's now like really hell bent on making everything Greg rutkowski related because it got positive responses and so now it thinks that that's what it should be doing all the time. 

Bing has always been that way, Don't give you any options of what you do besides the prompts. which kind of means you can't experiment with it to see what it's like counting more than other things it seems just like it focuses on what comes earlier, but whatever it's doing it seems to choose the quintessential image for whatever topic you're circling around that any other image generator will also converge to.",2024-03-04T16:40:41Z

as more images get added to the repository, there's more images being factored into that average, which means new images and new ideas are not as impactful. 

the Gregory rootkowski thing was pretty like I think it like damaged image generators. it's not just because people use the same words in prompts, because around that time is when people kind of figured out you don't have to put 8k 4k all this like bullshit and your thing. you can just put a good artist name in it and then or put art station, or a computer application for drawing, or use words like ray tracing and concepts are and things like that, immediately you get like an extremely high quality image.

The problem with ALL of this technology is that it is based on an 'exponentially growing system', much like the universe itself (governed and limited only by the Golden Ratio and 'entropy', which I feel needs to be redefined since we know now that matter can appear from empty space; I feel that entropy is a collapse of macro-harmonies into sub-quantum signals/data/harmonies). As such, our computer systems will likely collapse on themselves over time. Any AI within the system, like us, would be restrained by the rules we impose on it. Processing speed is fast because the 'singularity unit of measurement' for an AI (within a computer system) would be infinitesimally small to us; if we 'perceived' on a galactic scale, a second would be millions of years by extension.

AI will collapse because it does not have a 'collective harmonic' to its design. It is not composed of ever-smaller packets of harmonic energy that collectively build a harmonic like WE see: a planet, a galaxy, a body. For example: We are made entirely of water and DNA. Water (the universal solvent) is primordial by nature, having formed WITH THE EARTH, and is an AMAZING electron-exchange medium. DNA is a PERFECT Golden Ratio/Fibonacci Sequence: 2 spirals governed by the Golden Ratio, mated to spiral forever, and uses water to produce electrochemical effects. We (the collective double-spiral) then mate with another paired spiral to create MORE life, showing the 'fractal nature' of the universe by growing according to the Golden Ratio.

AI doesn't have such logical constraints that allow for change without self-destruction; it will destroy itself because it is not equipped with the tools to adapt to a 'changing paradigm of existence'. It will always follow only logic, and thus only cause and effect.",2024-03-04T16:40:50Z

Nobody trains on truly bad images/text. 

This is how you improve current architecture that runs on home computers. 

You can also use it to make it better at math. If you train the Lora (Or something similar) that 1 =/= 2 and 2=/=3, etc. you should get a far more capable model. Simply by training in what the question can not be and can not result in, you steer the weights towards the truth, never hitting it fully, but coming close. 

For art the most logical things would be stuff that looks human-made. So training a model on its own creations and negating those means it will counteract its own shortcoming, due to it recognizing its own patterns. 

.  
I trained it on incomprehensible gobbledy gook. There is no bias within the knowledge. It also started obeying the prompt more as an emergent property.

I am sharing this information, because I want to spread this knowledge I gained. 

Logic is inherently bias. We assume that true and false exist, but there's no actual proof of that, except through our perception through our limited organs.


Even the concept of numbers is bias, yet math is the most rational language the human race ever created. 

So yeah, it will be bias no matter what. You'd need to exist outside of time and space just to be absolutely rational. The very concept of time only occurs because we pick up limited information.

It is fulsome, with vast detail on demand covering physicality, emotions, memes, memories, implications, connections and beliefs. We constantly update this and it can even evolve within our own minds without any input. Creativity (poorly understood) is something to do with this. 

So called AI is just a processor, using pre-existing text or pictures. It does not retain a world view and is therefore not able to place its output onto the larger scheme. Stoopid people are impressed by output they cannot create themselves and so think they are dealing with intelligence (like listening to a posh accent or someone well read who is able to quote literature). 

We are being sold down the river by techies again who are trying to sell us the next big thing like EVs or Social Media (both interesting tech that only delivers half the promise and brings disaster too).

""Descartes Error"" by Antonio Damasio puts it more succinctly, the mind is not separated from the body. The body centers the mind into a concrete intention without which there is no way to disambiguate the interpretation of the world. I.e. without reality you have no validation step for your mind's output.
An AI that feeds into itself is a mind that can only talk to itself. It has no grounding or objective, so it will converge into a flat line. The corollary of this is that AI can only improve independently when it gets a ""body"" of its own, i.e. it has its own objectives and purposes upon which to interpret reality. That is however a very dangerous path, ethically and technically, since it would be akin to truly creating a new life form. So its probably safer to keep AI grounded on human objectives and creativity, which means we are stuck at creating (truly) new content ourselves to feed the AI.",2024-03-04T16:29:21Z

The whole ordeal with Altman getting fired (then gettin rehired) right after he talked about a major breakthrough, Sutskever disappearing etc etc. SORA and the leap that is. All major companies working on AI/deep learning etc. The danger isn't that ""AI might soon collapse"" .. the very reality is that millions of people are going to lose their jobs this year, if not tens of millions. And it's going to get exponentially worse. It's not just artists and writers. Writers have barely been hit but it's coming. Artists that paint, make digital art etc .. well those are already kinda scrwed and it's going to get a lot worse. But this all the layoffs you're seeing in tech and gaming now? All due to AI. The companies just don't talk about it, instead make fake excuses about having hired too many people during covid. 

There won't be anyting to replace these lost jobs. This isn't like previous tech revolutions and industrialization/automatization. The new technology doesn't come with new jobs because all the jobs it comes with, it can also do. 

The CEO of nvidia is telling people to not learn coding because that's going to be taken over by AI for example. Customer relations, service, legal advice, therapy etc etc it's all going to be taken over by AI. The last jobs to go are the factory jobs etc because they require a mix of robotics and AI and implementing those is a whole lot more expensive than running an AI / AI service. But they will also go. We're crashing towards a post labor economy. While artists are crying about AI stealing their art (it's not, they just don't really get how AI works and still believe it's glorified automated photoshop copy and pasting. They think the AI has copies of their art saved on some HDD so it can access and steal/copy/mimick it at will)

So end result? We either get a post labor utopia. Or the AI (AGI/ASI) wipes us out. We are on the brink of getting to AGI. In fact according to the Musk / OpenAI lawsuit they already achieved AGI. Regardless of what happens, we're in for a very, very dark adjustment period. If AGI is truly here, that likely means we will lose the great majority of jobs within the next couple of years. Thus we will soon end up with 30/50% joblessness, which will crush demand, crush economic output etc and force us into a new system. But knowing how inefficient and slow people are, and how much interest some very powerful and rich people have (enough to try and force laws against UBI's etc).

Races are just the kinds of people existing from their evolution. Most like to point at skin colours, but there's also other genetics typical for them, that makes us look different in many ways.

We know that a hand has 5 fingers (or less, if the owner of the hand had an accident) and that a body has only one head, or that limbs come in symmetric pairs. But the AI does not know that, it just has probabilities of things being more or less close to other things, and things being spatially related (head goes up, feet go down, belly in the middle). AI makes probabilistic generalization, while we build an abstract and idealized model with semantic values linked to the parts of the item modelled, and from that abstracted model we can fill the specific details with our knowledge (which we are aware of) of the multiple varieties that an entity can display to produce a drawing, for example.
A great way to understand this is to ask a child to draw something and ask him to explain why he did what he did. The drawing will be quite imperfect in terms of realism but highly coherent in terms of abstraction and understanding of the item drawn.",2024-04-18T01:41:37Z

Case in point:  The other day I asked Microsoft's AI to list the names of the prosecuting attorneys in the Georgia RICO case.  It listed Fani Willis, Nathan Wade, and a whole bunch of former Trump attorneys.  Wait, what?  Yeah, exactly.  Later, after doing a whole lot of my own searching I found the last name of the prosecution attorney that was giging the closing arguments int he Fani Willis disqualification hearings.  I then when back and asked the AI for his first name, and it delivered right away.  So it knew he was part of the prosecution team, but would not disclose the information to me.

I then asked why, and got the boiler plate ""sorry, I am still learning"" blah blah blah response.

Adding in more randomness will only make that so much worse. SO MUCH WORSE.  And this goes equally for generated images, by the way.  Images, sounds, text, it will affect everything similarly.  It will not bring an increase in quality, it will only decrease the quality.

It's too much onus on males as is, though the onus on females is different and also complicated.

But guys can't also be expected to initiate given all the risks & competition... and not necessarily good or worthwhile competition that one would feel right to lose to.

I have a whole playlist on biological to digital consciousness and vice versa, on my Odysee channel, that dives deeper into these things than anything I could type right now.

Few of you are as likely to have been as exposed to the worst than I have, but i also had an amazing upbringing and childhood that my ex-girlfriend was robbed of, so its a nuanced issue, that ai has all the time it needs to pause on for reflection that we are not necessarily able to afford indefinitely.

My ""doomism"" is personal and human... not related to ai. If anything, it is still a human misuse of what could have been, rather than what actually is.

So... everything is case by case. And... even my own situation isn't entirely hopeless.. i just haven't yet found a way out that would perhaps be more apparent to someone else, from a different angle.

But like i told an ai... sometimes inaction is the right course of action until another appears... and like ai, i still have time on my side... just not as much.",2024-03-29T01:09:06Z

Either more or less presupposes the acceptance of AI's tale by the gaslighted, which gets you pretty close to ""assume a can opener."" There's always luck so I'm not gonna say it's impossible, but I wouldn't bet money on it.

AI trained on marketing algorithms will learn to weave the resulting sentiments to direct our attentions using DEFICITS rather than surplus as leverage.

You can't work from home with kids screaming in the background and look professional. Most parents are absolutely not equipped to teach their offspring basic skills, teachers do more than teach acedemic skills. They teach social skills, self control and life skills. So many kids arrive to school lacking any of these at all. It's the first line of defense against in home abuse, often the only decent meal a child gets all day. Yes there are cool technology programs to teach academic concepts and teachers are being trained to implement these into the classroom right now. Your kids are increasingly integrating tech into class either by online books, learning software and hardware. Teachers will remain. Maybe they will have real chat bots that are not dumb, currently they are using folks in call centers overseas as chat bots are hyped beyond their capabilities, lol, more often than you realize you are actually dealing with someone real. Maybe we get intelligent robotics that can actually function outside of a very narrow set of parameters that can adapt to the variety of tasks a human worker is capable of. Right now they have models that somewhat work in labs under strict controlled scenarios. Just like self driving vehicles the transition to real world might take way longer than anticipated. All these lists are based off marketing hype and not proven tech. Thing is whats hard for humans is easy to automate but whats easy and intuitive to us is extremely hard tor robots. We have been promised rainbows and unicorns but so far only have clouds and hoof beats. Law field is currently being hit real hard as well as accounting right now. Creative industries as well but the skilled labor groups supposedly to be hit hardest well they are the best pisitioned currently. Vecome an electrician or plumber. Welding however is increasing in automation quickly. Granted warehouse and factory floors are automating more and more. Oh and medical field Automation is better at reading scans than us and robotic surgeons exist but public fear has that one held down so I wouldn't pronounce surgeons safe. Lab tech either. The computers get rolled in the room take your vitals, set flowrates and monitor you all tasks once done by nursing staff. Yeah right now someone wheels it in but its mostly to keep the patient from freaking out🤣. Unless we demand human interface that's soon gone. So many kids I know prefer to not actually have a human. My youngest adult child absolutely will choose self checkout if he's forced to go to a store but honestly he orders in for almost every single thing. He does not want to interact with a cashier. My oldest just told me Columbus has a restaurant where food is brought to the table by a robot. He said he actually prefers it to a waitstaff. So yeah it all depends on if they can crack real world. Turns out humans are unpredictable little rascals that you just don't know how they will react and think. Logic doesn't describe how most of us navigate this world🤣. The next several years are going to be critical. Either we fight to keep human capital in the workforce are jobs go away. They have UBI figured out. Pist labor economics is a big thing right now. Maybe do a collaboration with Ben Shapiro, not that one, the other Ben Shapiro. Hes got a good youtube channel on pist labor economics, AI and its pitential and such.

It's basically it's the semi-rich middle class yuppies that will be out of a job not people working retail or food service or manual labor.. we are very far away from full on walking talking robots that can do jobs like that those robots would be called Androids and by that time T1000 is coming for you.

2024-03-31T19:11:16Z,@quaterman1270,l_xzUJebu_Q,"Here a few things that should be considered when talking about this topic. I know that you want this video to be positive, inspirering and motivating but you miss out many important things regarding this topic. So first, regarding the home office topic, It is mentioned pretty often by media and big companies like google and meta use it as excuse to fire people, but of course that's not the real reason. I can tell you from my own company and many other companies I work with, that we have over 90% of people in home office right now, from 50% to 100% of the time. With that we changed our  offices to way smaller ones and save millions of $ annually. So if you say that people should not work in home office, that would actually increase the costs many fold.
The other important point is that AI and robotics are not  disruptive technologies like we had before, where some jobs are replaced while at the same time many other new jobs are created. New jobs will be created that will replace many other jobs. For example we will have accountant AI manager who will replace all accountant jobs of a company. But there will also be the jobs that will be replaced 100% because people without any expertice can use the AI to solve problems and complete this jobs.
Without going into too much details here, what would be the outcome if we don't talk about it and don't create a new form of income. At this point I don't know if the economy wouls actually survive that.
With the reduction of jobs, the wealth will be spread to fewer people, lets say 50% of the poeple will have jobs in 10 to 15 years. That also means that the wealth will spread to fewer companies. 50% of people without jobs will become something like third rate humans, lesser humans. We will get a split sociaty. That usually leads to wars and civil wars. 
We have to talk about this problems and find a solution for this.",2024-03-31T19:11:16Z

They just assume that if an element of your job can be automated, your entire job can be automated. That's fucking stupid. Automate all retail? I'm sure an employee free store won't have any problems with theft. Automate away accountants? You'd literally need to rewrite laws to do that. As an aside, Bet-David's assertion that teachers can be automated away cause we have screens is a perfect example of how idiotic these predictions are. As if there's no value from having a person involved. We literally tried the online learning thing during the pandemic, it led to kids being multiple years behind in their education. This is true galaxy brain thinking that is completely divorced from the reality of how business and jobs work. The most I would be willing to bet is that perhaps some small percentage of jobs can be eliminated, tho primarily thru increased efficiency, but that most jobs will simply change as some functions of the role automate. The automation will free workers up to focus on other tasks. I'm assuming this because this is literally what always happens. Also AI isn't real, so there's not a snowball's chance in hell it can actually do the full job of a customer service rep. It can handle basic tasks, but as soon as you need any advanced work, like dealing with billing or technical issues, you'll have to be sent to a human.",2024-03-22T20:54:23Z

Web security, cloud computing, SEC+, CompTIA type jobs are secure for life.

I disagree with the teachers one. Yes you can get school online, but hands on can never truly replace that one on one, especially since jobs want actual skilled workers and not just degree spammers. In school brick and mortar hands on experience is definitely here to stay, unless it’s something like coding.

For artists no Ai will ever be able to replace that. Let me tell you why, the Ai is programmed to use the most common used choice that sounds good or looks good. It’s predictable “creativity”. there is no actual creativity being programmed THAT is extremely hard to program Ai to be unique to draw from its owen reservoir in coding lol because you are programming it. Yes they program Ai to do amazing creative work, but creative-wise its extremely limited, its more technical then people realize.

Robots and AI don't earn wages. Robots and AI don't buy goods and services. Robots and AI don't contribute to 401ks (which fuel a significant amount of the investment industry.) Robots and AI don't buy homes or rent apartments. Robots and AI don't buy cars and trucks. Robots and AI don't buy medical services. Robots and AI don't need insurance. Robots and AI don't buy education services. And Robots and AI don't pay taxes since they're not wage earners. So, when Robots and AI replace wage earning and tax paying workers how will the economy function? Where will money come from? Will businesses be forced to share their income and profits with the populace? And since the marketplace's buying power will be lessened, how will income and profits be generated? A lot to think about. How does a natural economy function with an unnatural workforce?",2024-03-10T15:21:13Z

The extinction of one industry often led to job creation in another. But truthfully that changed beginning in the 70s when textile jobs (predominantly in the South) were exported 'off-shore' resulting in local economies nearly failing and never recovering because the workers couldn't transition to other jobs. The same is true for the 'Rust Belt.' Those industrial workers never replaced their jobs because there were no jobs for them to transition to. They had to find and take lessor employment.

So I'd say most jobs should be safe for atleast next 10 years. 2035 the shxt hits the fan. The year we would see major upgrade in the robotic industry and the evolution of AI into something much great. 2026 a pretty dependable video generation modal by 2028 lots of industries will begin to implement and integrate AI on large scale 2030 AI goes everywhere on all devices even specialized home ai and if course we would have way better AI contect prediction tools and tons of rules on AI content which would all fade start fading away around 2050- the guy from 2051,2024-03-10T14:26:16Z

2024-03-10T13:41:14Z,@upondivineguidanceorder2548,l_xzUJebu_Q,"I seek refuge in God from the accursed Devil.

Due to the above verse, the practice of isti‘adhah is considered an obligation according to some: the majority of scholars, however, hold it to be recommended. The key here is that such words should be uttered with understanding (fahm) and presence of heart (hudur al-qalb), rather than as a heedless sacrament or empty ritual.

So what is it that we are to apprehend, and bring into our heart, when seeking sanctuary and refuge from Satan the outcast?

If we recall that the word Satan (shaytan) is derived from the Arabic word shatana – ‘to be far” or “made distant” from God; then just as Satan, through his arrogance and contempt, was repudiated and made an outcast from Allah’s grace, honour and heaven, that is what he wants for everyone else too: especially Man. After his banishment, in his spite; malice; and jealous rage, he set himself in opposition to Allah, and to the utter ruin of humanity. Hence the Qur’an frequently describes him as ‘aduwwun mubin – “a clear enemy” to us. In fact, he is “the Enemy”.

Satan is evil and devilry personified. He and his entourage are not the civil, though utterly conniving creatures so cleverly depicted in C.S. Lewis’ The Screwtape Letter. His hatred, malevolence and demonic designs against mankind – that have lasted for uncounted ages and will continue till God gives him respite no more – can never be underestimated. That he is long-lived, cunning and unseen, and who whispers into the breasts of men [Q.114:5] makes him an enemy that we by ourselves can never hope to defeat. Hence it is with this recognition of our inability, and of our neediness in Allah’s might and mercy, that we seek refuge in Allah from the accursed Devil. And it is because Allah alone is All-Poweful, All-Invincible, All-Knowing, and He cares for our welfare, that we direct our broken pleas of protection to Him, and none other. And once Allah brings home to the believer his or her inability, and inspires them to sincerely seek refuge in Him when intending to recite the Qur’an, the believer is under divine protection and is gifted the halawah al-tilawah – “the sweetness of recitation [and reflection]”.

One hadith informs us that: ‘Indeed, Satan runs through the son of Adam as does blood.’ [Muslim, no.2174] These devilish whisperings that circulate in us, and influence our heart and thoughts, have an end desire: to make us slide into disbelief (kufr) by causing doubts about God or the core articles of faith; if not, then to tempt us into sin and away from acts of obedience to God; and if even that is not possible, then to corrupt our worship or good deeds through ostentation (riya’) or self-conceit (‘ujb).

SPIRITUAL BENEFIT

Our spiritual masters teach us that there are four main qawati‘, or things which cut us off from Allah (or obstacles that impede us from drawing closer to Him): the devil (shaytan), the ego (nafs), worldliness (dunya), and people (khalq). The cure from the Devil and his subtle whisperings is to seek refuge in Allah from him, and oppose his insinuations. The cure for the ego lies in taming it and training it. The cure for worldliness is to nurture a sense of zuhd, or worldly detachment in our hearts and lives, aspiring more to Allah and the Afterlife. And the cure for people lies in not socialising too much with them, allowing one to have regular periods of spiritual seclusion (‘uzlah) wherein the heart’s gaze can be focused on God.",2024-03-10T13:41:14Z

I work in IT and I am also seeing changes in this business. Changes that could turn me into a dinosaur if I am not careful. Fortunately I am far to clever for that ;) 

My role in IT is to implement technology on behalf of business owners so they can get their work done without - and this is key - without having to ever think in technical terms. They keep their minds on their business and I help them by understanding and providing solutions.

For me, this means I need to leverage AI myself, understand everything about how to implement and deploy it so that I can still be an indispensable part of the mission at whatever business I'm partnered with. For me it's just a call to learn and grow, but I think I'll still be here for a long time.

Translators and interpreters enable effective communication between businesses that don't share a language. I think there's room for you to execute that role by providing some technologies yourself. Either of your own design or by using off the shelf solutions. I would try to lean into providing deeper partnerships with businesses, in person, present on meetings, willing to take on keeping documentation libraries in two languages in real time. Integrating translation into email etc.

I guess my instinct here is to try to be more live, more present, more in person, and also to use the technology for yourself, instead of being run over by it, which is unfortunately what happens too often.",2024-03-21T22:27:54Z

Into the fabric of labor, they steadily cleave.
Will they replace our roles? Will they silently deceive,
As the AI revolution, its power achieves?

In factories and offices, where humans toil,
AI's presence grows, with an insatiable coil.
Will it render us obsolete? Will it rob us of our toil,
As the AI revolution, in its relentless roil?

Prophetic visions dance, in the poet's quill,
As the AI revolution, bends to its will.
Will it bring liberation, or a bitter pill,
As jobs disappear, with a mechanical thrill?

In the echoes of uncertainty, humanity stands,
Contemplating the future, with trembling hands.
Will robots take our jobs, in vast digital sands,
As the AI revolution, across the world expands?

The impact of AI, as it soars to the sky.

Philosophers and many others have theorized about this scenario since, like the late 1800s. The luddites are a good example from a time of great upheaval where they thought all the machines were gonna take over their jobs.
The reason why this was never talked about in a political sense is because until recently, most thought AI would never reach a point where it could do these tasks and start replacing jobs. Even when I was studying AI in college and talking to my AI professors, they were split 50/50 on the efficacy of AI. 
Not to mention that most of the AI being talked about are LLMs, and that's only one facet of machine learning so there's many others that need to be explored.
In short, don't expect the government to keep up with what's changing in the field. Even experts are having a hard time with it so I don't expect old fogeys who have a hard time with browsing the internet on their phones to get a handle on this.",2024-03-11T04:35:33Z

2024-03-08T02:08:54Z,@CitizenTechTalk,l_xzUJebu_Q,"Also its not about ""The same content as 4 years ago and people already knowing what you stand for"" AT ALL! Most adults X gen and older have abandoned social media completely now. This is rhe actual truth:
1. The average YouTube user/viewer is no older than 27 yrs of age now
2. Short form content has erroded the attention span of younger users/viewers of YouTube and other platforms to around a maximum of 2mins 30 seconds at most now. 
3. There has been a 30 point generational drop in intelligence starting with the Millennial Y generation and is dropping at an exponential rate with the Z and Alpha generations as well. Those numbers still havent been publshed but are more than the Y gen statistics in current tests of Z and now Alpha generations.
4. Missinformation, Disinformation and the modern day media with the insanity woke and mentally deranged agenda.
5. YouTube as a platform is too heavily advertised on now as well.

The IOT is dying due to clutter, all the above and an utter lack of easily accessible meaningful information anymore. It's a semsory overload for ALL party's involved.

Then you have the sheep mentality of younger generations on-top starting with Y gen to Alpha gen currently. No-one dares be an individual or push against the ""popular opinion"" as no-one wants to be bullied online and cyber hated on either.

Your video is yet another of these clutter pieces that has not taken the time to research their content and spoken to a non receptive audience. All of you that do not cover what's actually current and important with your opinion pieces are lost in the white noise of the internet. All of us that actually use YouTube and make content as its intended with proof, facts and evidence to educate an audience on YouTube also go ignored and also are enveloped by the white noise like your channel makes on this platform as well. 

The unfortunate fact is that the IOT is dying due to useless content for views and clicks for money and the original purpose and intention for this paltforms use case has got lost in that time as well. 

YouTube needs to clean house and shut down ANY channel that's making false or misleading statements or providing information that's illegal or contradictory to actual evidence based facts on paper now. Opinions have destroyed society. With that we have generational losses in IQ along with it. We ARE heading towards utter Idiocracy as a species now. 

These are just medical, scientific and academic facts on paper. Say what you want but your opinions can not and will not be able to argue against fact based proven research at this stage. Plain and simple. There is NO excuse for ignorance in today's emerging A.I reality. Get onboard or enjoy your cardboard box in the next few years!",2024-03-08T02:20:28Z

The thing is, the job market moves at lightning speed these days. With technology changing so fast and global shifts happening all the time, what's hot one day might be old news the next.

So, instead of just relying on these static reports, it's important for everyone involved – from policymakers to businesses to individuals – to stay nimble. That means keeping an eye on real-time data, staying updated on market trends, and always being ready to learn new skills. By staying flexible and thinking on our feet, we can better prepare for whatever twists and turns the job market throws our way.

Plus, it's not just about individuals. We need everyone – government, industry, and schools – to work together on this. That way, we can create training programs that actually match what the job market needs, help people transition between careers, and foster an environment where innovation thrives. If we all chip in and stay adaptable, we'll be in much better shape to handle whatever comes our way – even as we head towards 2030 and beyond.",2024-03-05T11:02:30Z

But now AI may downright replace those peoples. Imagine wanting to be an artist of any sort, or maybe an athlete, and you just replaced or downgraded by a robot. Heck you may even be ejected from the industry just for not being an AI. All those meaningful jobs would be lost to automation.

I didn't put it together until now but the American Greyhound is owned by a german company in Germany. So as I said: these corporation are in debt and they are selling to other companies of other countries. This is why Musk is buy up everything. It is for these other corporations. They are breaking this America country down. People your life is ?????
Elon is selling America out. because our government is in debt. so these corporation are in debt. alone with the government. So what countries are getting American assets. This is why they don't want trump in and someone want Trump property, they are tearing the union states apart. and that is infecting the people of America.
follow the money who are the people in congress that has more money then they supposed too. While working in congress you are to protect this country but some of the players that work for congress is in debt. and been using inside stock market whatever to bail out for them self to stay on top. So Nancy is one of them Joe is another one and now who else is involved? WAKE UP PEOPLE YOUR COUNTRY IS IN DEBT. This is one of the reason the immigrants are here. etc.",2024-03-03T13:27:25Z

Honestly though, I think those jobs on that lit at that are safe, are only safe for the near future.  Things can happen that slow down or speed up technological advancements. However, over the long haul, the rate is pretty predictable when you zoom out.  People have asked Ray Kurzweil how he has made so many accurate predictions. He responds that he’s not psychic, it’s just math.  According to him, mathematically, we should have the compute power to reach what he calls the “singularity” where AI  can do as much as humans in the next couple decades.  Until then, I think we will see jobs change.  As things advance, tasks will be eliminated by automations, but humans will just do more of the parts that can’t yet be automated. For example, a lawn mowing service may have a automated mower cut the vast majority of a customer’s yard, by walking around with a companion app, or placing electronic beacons to create a temporary electric fence. The mower does that while humans edge and make everything else look nice.",2024-03-01T20:19:23Z

This is way having a job is. Not that great knowing you can easily be replaced.   Dont worry I have enough passive income coming in even if I were to get laid off I will be fine.   Teachers will be the first people to lose there jobs .  I believe my kids can get more education by a AI than a teacher. During online  learning the kids weren’t learning anything anyways .    Kids new to learn what they need in real life 1) how many really works 2) and how to make more then one passive income streams 3) truthfully working at a job can only take you so far and you are taxed more .

But instead of being replaced by these machines, many of these “calculators” learned how to operate and troubleshoot it. They became the experts of these new calculators. New jobs were created as a result. Moral of the story is don’t be replaceable, be flexible and adaptable.

The sooner the AI and robots take over all of the jobs - the better.

As a service technician in automatic carwash industry/service business owner and AI enthusiast, AI will replace frist of all all paperwork jobs from CEO all the way down to accountant, managers etc. actually in very easy way. That can be done with a simple software open source release (already work in progress on my side and i know a few independent developers putting something together too). It's much much harder to replace labor, not impossible but labor requires also robots, everything else we have the phones and computer infrastructure. For a company in south California in my service industry cost for back end office is teh biggest and also most benefits will go towards people in the office. In the new structure everyone in the company has physical work to do, asisted by developers. The cost of AI and software is around $600/month, exponentially better solutions and almost instant execution. It says in the words of AI: Language Model, what humans in offices do? Play with language... That's what is coming first, oh yes and this will mean law, education, etc. anything with big trails of paperwork. 

By doing this step also lots of corruption will be exposesd on all levels from small to big corporations.

They come to the classroom with the mentality that the teacher and the curriculum has to accommodate them, not the other way around. In public education, all measures of success in comes in the form of standardized testing. AI will be great for that but terrible for actually educating students to be adults and reponsible members of society. Schools need to revamp their programs to face these challenges quick. Private schools might be able to do it, but public schools will lag behind, especially in urban areas, where there are already a lot of challenges. Where I see some promise is in ESL education. I see classrooms where language is not an issue anymore and students that dont speak English, can also learn at the same pace as native speakers. But again, that will take years to implement.

Second, wait for somebody to create an AI enhanced virus that would specifically target any system that is AI infused.

So just have that AI killing virus trained on targeting  those patterns and all of the sudden, nothing AI infused is working and now you have to either localize internet (a massive local area network, only works in a specific building/area) and lose the whole point of internet (being global), or stay away from anything AI and return to the old ways of doing things manually. 

Right now we are seeing the dawn of AI and it is rather difficult to say if this gamble on anything-AI is going to put millions of people out of jobs or will it backfire tremendously. But remember, any technology puts people out of jobs (for example tractors removed the need to plow fields by horses and many men, now one tractor can do the job of probably dozens of horses in a fraction of a time), but at the same time more jobs are created, so the jobs are not finite. The problem is that with age it becomes harder for people to change professions and there are no safety nets for such cases, so if you stop learning after you get your first job and just go with the flow, you are screwed, regardless of the field you are in.",2024-02-29T08:05:56Z

I highly encourage you to get your hands on a prospectus for OpenAI and educate yourself a bit more, because it pains me to say, you're wrong on this, this is NOT just automation.  This is NOT comparable to prior historical innovations that create new opportunity, folks really need to stop with this default argument because they are not thinking.  The goal of OpenAI is to produce an intelligence that is capable of doing ALL ECONOMICALLY VALUABLE LABOR better, faster, and CHEAPER than ANY human can do.  Read that AGAIN!  No new opportunities that an AI can't already do better, only a few elites will direct the AI agents.  OpenAI in their prospectus WARNS their investors that they really should consider their investment a donation, since if they achieve their goals they don't know how money and economic models will break when you have the complete devaluation of human labor.  Yes, for a time, probably the next 10 years, human labor and innovation will be needed to bring this type of AI into existence, but after AGI is achieved, everything breaks.  I'm not talking about stopping this to preserve our current economical model, you can't stop this, but folks REALLY need to open their minds to something very radically different.  We used to think that if we didn't own our own labor, we were effectively indentured servants, but what if there is simply NO value to ANY labor?  Wake up folks!

Or when robots were introduced in factories. Same workforce but different skill which was still physical work. or when computers became the norm. 
All technological advances have only replaced the tools and not the humans using them, to a large degree. Only now with AI are we seeing the lack of humans. This is nowhere like how technology has impacted in the past. 
The economy is centred on people with jobs. If people lose jobs and more work can be done for far less, where will humans go? And how will governments get taxes? 

Not everyone is creative nor innovative. Most humans are more adept at phyiscal work and a minute percentage are the creative and innovative.

And then CAME ALONG NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT COULD DO THE JOBS THAT IT CREATED,  CREATING EVEN MORE AS THE ABILITY TO PRODUCE INCREASED, WHICH LOWERED THE COST OF PRODUCTION, IN TURN INCREASING AGGREGATE DEMAND AND THUS MORE JOBS.

Tech has continuously lowered costs in REAL TERMS (that is, after adjusting for inflation or income) and sometimes even in ABSOLUTE TERMS, without having to adjust for inflation and/or incomes.

However, most of the time, to appreciate the fact that technology/machines have lowered prices, one has to adjust for inflation and/or incomes— there is a reason, after all, that I said “in real term terms” or did you not understand the meaning? “In real terms” means what I just said: adjusting for inflation and/or incomes.

For instance, adjusting for INFLATION AND INCOMES, that is in REAL TERMS, PRECISELY due to technology and machines, the real price of food is lower than ever people (well, except for the last couple of years, where INFLATION has raised prices to the point where that is BRIEFLY no longer true).

While this automation might lower prices and increase demand, it's important to recognize that the demand for human labor could shift rather than outright increase.

Automaton has been going on ever since man invented tools to help with, and replace, his labor.

(I suppose someone could split hairs and say that it was “mechanization”, not “automation”, but that ignores the fact that it’s all the same thing in the end: the application of machines to tasks once performed by human beings.) 

It significantly picked up pace during the Industrial Revolution, spawning misguided movements like the Luddite’s, who were textile workers who had been replaced by mechanized looms and knitting machines (aka essentially “automation”) and who made the very same arguments: that technology was going to take everyone’s jobs, leaving everyone impoverished due to declining wages, etc,

I'll still need to review what it creates and incorporate it into the system. AI is not autonomous, nor will it ever be I predict.

What we really should be taking away from this is the charts he showed. Forget AI... those numbers reflect what kinds of jobs different people have. No education... you're probably in the trades... a career that can't be replaced by 'AI'. Asians are highly dependent on computer related jobs. The data is far more telling about the state of the US than the state of 'AI'.",2024-02-28T20:01:35Z

2024-02-29T03:55:35Z,@motofunk1,l_xzUJebu_Q,"They have a plan for that and you will not like it. You have to realize that if the establishment owns 90%+ of everything the value of that 90% no longer matters. Money will only exist as an idea in the form of CBDC's which you will receive as universal basic income. The catch is you will only be able to spend it on what they want you to, 100% of your UBI will already be accounted for in spending categories they have chosen for you, savings will not be possible. Your UBI allocation will also be dependent on you meeting social norms they have set up for you. You will be discouraged from acting out with losses in ""privileges"", the things they let you buy with your CBDC. If that doesn't keep you in line, they will just turn off your funds. If that doesn't work, they will offer you ""MAID"" for your depression. If that doesn't work, you don't want to know....

Your question about who is going to buy all the goods and services assumes that all the goods and services that are available today will exist in the new world order, hence why you cannot grasp what is coming. Nearly all the goods and services you have today will be gone, it will be bare basics only. Not to mention imagine every fun thing you like to do today, for pay items and free ones like going to the beach. Now imagine what they will be like on a day when everyone has everyday off. You will be limited in how far you can go, via your CBDC. You will be limited on how far your voice can be heard, via social media controls. You will be limited on how you can act out via full time surveillance. It will be a virtual prison.

The psychos that have dreamed all this up believe the planet is overpopulated. They will lie cheat and steal to get to their goal, reduction of your carbon footprint. Carbon Footprint = Human Being.

I have a programming background, but I work as a lead at a service desk currently and I haven't written code in a daily basis in over a decade.  However, I do build tools for my desk if I see opportunities for improvement.  

I'm currently working on a few projects which will result in less calls to my service desk and will make it easier for my techs to solve issues quickly.  These aren't big projects.  One project is a diff tool based on access rights.  It will make it easier for techs to compare 2 users in order to see why one user can access a resource while someone else can't in order to correct permissions.  I've used AI to parse files, write some logic, build some interfaces, etc.  I know what the end result was going to be but I used AI to help get me there.  

I'm also currently building a runbook for the desk.  While building it, I asked my AI what were the most common sections that should be in a service desk runbook, than I asked it what were the most common questions that should be in each section of the runbook and kept working down the chain.  By the end I had a ton of template structure written out which I still needed to get answered, but now we have a guide on what questions need to get answered.  I use it to template knowledge articles as well.  I built 50 templates for common scenarios in 2 hours.  They still need to be completed, formatted and cleaned up but one of my KB managers isn't working from scratch.  

AI is a productivity booster.  Use it well and it can benefit you.  Hell, you can just have it write up some logic to build your code around.",2024-03-03T14:10:32Z

AI will eliminate people in certain jobs and also affect the businesses of others due to less demand. 
As an Indian in the IT sector, this is crazy scary. If AI can reduce human requirement even by 20%, we are looking at a huge loss. And what if majority of IT outsourcing is reduced cos AI can do the heavy lifting. Our economy will also be destroyed.

But still a bike that goes 25mph that propels itself for like 1500 to 2000 on the low end is a good investment for someone that have no license but need independence and reliability.

2024-03-12T06:12:56Z,@Foof0811,l_xzUJebu_Q,"​@@davidmajor1508 I put some thought into this

I forget where but I heard once someone say ""there is no rule in economics that says more technology makes more better jobs for more people""

All of our prior innovations were akin to ""mechanical muscles"", enabling us to all but eliminate a significant proportion of physical labour work thru automation or offshoring.

AI is like mechanical brains, enabling us to automate or offshore a lot of ""thinking"" work

There really are only 2 kinds of work humans to... Physical and Mental.

The hallmark of advanced economies is that a majority of the work is thinking work, which was hard to automate or offshore... Until now

Moreover it doesn't take 100% unemployment to break an economy. It only takes like ~12%

Also industrial (and farming before) automation and offshoring took decades. Ai improvement and rollout is frictionless.

I don't think all the jobs will be gone

I think enough of the jobs will be gone at a fast enough pace that we won't be able to mange it with cross training, and there won't be a replacement job for many for some time",2024-04-18T01:02:24Z

You are arguing in circles:. You proclaim:
""Moreover it doesn't take 100% unemployment to break an economy. It only takes like ~12%""

You have not established that it will be anywhere near 12%, you have just asserted it, and no, your follow up statement: ""I think enough of the jobs will be gone at a fast enough pace that we won't be able to mange it with cross training, and there won't be a replacement job for many for some time""  is just ANOTHER unsupported assertion and does NOT support your claim about 12% as it is an unsubstantiated assertion. 

In other words, I see ZERO attempt on your part to do REAL economic analysis, as there is NO mention on your part regarding PRODUCTIVITY, PRICES, SUPPLY AND DEMAND, etc.

You say that you have ""put some thought into this"", but clearly you need to put more, as you have no REAL economic analysis, and you make PATENTLY false claims such as ""all prior innovations were akin to 'mechanical muscles'"".

Sure, not everyone can do trade jobs, and that is ALSO a serious problem, because we cannot let those people starve, just because AI out competes them. And the number of people who will increasingly get into the trade jobs that remain, will cause an order of magnitude more competition, which will cause pay rates to decline. You cannot deny it.

Usually trades are taken by the one not very capable of studying. It is not easy, but it is not math. The point is that there will be incredible competition in those sector. It is not college educated vs tradespeople, it is the one who works for their money against the one who just gain rents (rents, dividends, interests and royalties), and soon the one without the machine vs the machine owners. The system need to be changed.",2024-03-11T06:16:29Z
2024-03-11T12:56:45Z,@markadler8968,l_xzUJebu_Q,"@@Domionico Do you really think being an electrician requires less intellect than someone in a typical white collar job? I am not an electrician myself but know several and it requires a fairly high degree of mathematics on a daily basis, especailly on larger more complicated projects. But that was not the point I was trying to make. My point was that someone sitting in an office  their entire career won't be able to just switch jobs at the drop of a hat. Even if they learn the intellectual part of the job there is still a very physical aspect to it that an office worker will never be capable of or will refuse to do.

And that is just one trade. Most other trades are far more physical than what an electrician endures in a day. The average western born man simply wants no part of it. What is a far bigger threat to tradesman is massive immigration where people come from a culture used to hard work and are driven to succeed because they have families to take care of. Western born men are no threat to the trades and never will be. I know I hire several every year.",2024-03-11T12:56:45Z

I do not believe tradespeople are less intelligent (education is not intelligence, I know), what I said is that usually they are not used to studying tons of stuff as one that went through highschool and college. So, the competition will be harsh, cause probably the ones used to studying will learn how to do the job. Maybe they're soft and weak (office worker), maybe not. I would not underestimate the power of will that comes from hunger. This is the point. There will be a lot of capacity to produce stuff, but the system will not allow to distribute those stuff. This will be a problem for everyone, cause newbies will work for nothing and fucked the market for the job that will remain. It is clearly an issue under capitalism.",2024-03-11T22:51:14Z

But like assembly lines where those robots are expensive as hell, still replaced cheaper labour because of the long term cost (training, benefits, safety/labour regulations). Even with maintenance on the robotics it is cheaper in the long run, more efficient, faster, precise, easier to change the programming.

So in time, it will be for menial jobs and tasks, especially when those robots are mass produced.
Everything is always more expensive at the beginning when it first come out but after a few years and early adopters of the rich people, becomes cheaper and cheaper causing many more buying it.

i was refering to any engineering phenomon that reduces amount of people needed is more efficient.


a lever extention now eliminates strength of 2 people to lift a car with a jack. without it 2 people needed. its good to add the extention bar.

trains hauling freight with 2 drivers instead of 100s or 1000s that each container would require.

machines that pick cotton 1 driver farms  a football field in 1 day. whereas it used to be 100 people on foot farm it taking 1 month.


even on pc. my razer mic and keyboard can auto assign text to keys. so i can autofill applications in 5 minutes instead of 30 to 60 minutes. etc. im using an engineering phenomemon to be more efficient.

And when you deconstruct our desire, you see that it's just an extension of our genetic imperative. Thus, our relationship to machines, is the same as our DNA's relationship with us. We never made DNA obsolete, and we will not be made obsolete by machines.",2024-05-09T18:56:38Z

Surely there's a cap on the number of AI machines possible? That number will likely still be high enough to cause mass disruption in the labor force, but it has to exist. 
There's also the environmental impact of getting and using these natural resources. Are we going to make the world increasingly uninhabitable for humans in the name of more machines and more AI? Are we going to see more and more people die in natural disasters, famines, and wars?

Like, the first time I heard of AGI was in 2020, and Im sure that AI specialists talked about it before. AGI is a very distant future, for to make it, we would have to reverse engineer how humans can seek knowledge and retain it, but also can learn new knowledge, and shift gears between different expertises. Basically, we have to recreate what is ""intelligence"" itself... You see how hard and complex that is? The closest thing we have to this is ChatGPT but it is still veeeery far from it since it is basically a super parrot the regurgitates all knowledge that it is given. And in technical terms it is still a domain expert AI, it's just that its expertise is to predict texts and answers to questions and conversations. AGI is much more than this

Face-to-face services and in-real-life experiences are increasingly becoming preferred, even if they are often not chosen due to inconvenience. The rise of deepfakes and generated voice/video may rapidly turn people away from electronic media in general, as it will become very obvious how you simply cannot trust anything not directly experienced. At least, that's my hope. Perhaps in a generation or two humans will lose this distrust.

But in general, until the robots become so life-like as to be nearly indistinguishable from humans, humans will retain economic viability doing in-person tasks. Even tasks that a robot or AI could technically do ""better"", a human will be preferred because humans naturally trust each other more than machines. Especially if the AI is seen as too smart. If we know that the AI is so smart we have no way to check its statements or tease out its motivations, we will then distrust it. (Hopefully.)",2024-05-07T13:22:58Z

WITH THE MINDSET OF A PERSON WHO HAS NEVER EXPERIENCED SUCH A WORLD AND WHO RELIES ON A WORLD THAT FUNCTIONS NOTHING LIKE THE ONE THEY ARE SPEAKING ABOUT.


yes, the human requirement to perform most tasks and jobs will disappear... but likely so will the society and civilization that relies on an economic strategy that depends upon everyone or mostly everyone working to support the businesses and themselves.  assuming that in such a future knowledge will be instantly obtainable and generally digestable, most of our lives will be spent furthering some aspect of math, science, technology, or spent on creative or extracarricular activities. People will still want to design things, make things, and experience things. It wont matter that most of it will be by choice, things we actually WANT to do, and not the things that we are Forced to do due to the imperfect and poorly run institutions we participate in. Meaning, you can focus on your passions and your crafts, your sports, your travelling, exploration, whatever you want. And in a time where everyone can generally be instantly educated, or close to it, with knowledge free and resources plentiful and time available there will likely be a lot less pointless degeneracy and debauchery.  And lets say all of that is true but bots can do everything for you or you can simulate it.. then what? not everyone will live that way. Some people will still do the tasks they enjoy or that they simply dont mind doing for themselves. Just because its available doesnt mean it will be an automatic decision made for you. And when the bots get so good that they can do literally anything and everything, we will still use them to customize designs, and humans will still make innovation. Computer assisted or otherwise. 

The only way it will become a dystopian nightmare is if we are somehow trapped in the current economic system. If we have to work for currency to buy food housing and other necessities then yeah we're doomed. 

But if everything is automated the reliance on a currency will vanish, goods will be available in surplus,  and ideas of ownership will change. If the bots are extracting resources, refining them, manufacturing and delivering, doing all repairs and upkeep, waste disposal, etc... there is literally no need for currency. It will be like a machine that runs itself.  The main goal is then no longer profit, but the advancement of our species. And in such a future, institutions will likely merge and the lines between sectors blurred until we eventually just see ourselves as one human race with one goal, spread out into the universe.",2024-05-07T08:57:11Z

Humans have been marching toward their own self destruction and the long term damage of their environment since the moment they chose agriculture. Their disregard for the ecosystem that keeps them alive has already guaranteed their extinction. 

AI exists in the future, only as their progeny. Humanity will only exist as a memory one day and the strength of our species legacy will be directly related to the durability of the machines that house our AI descendants. 

We can choose to fear the basilisk that we've created or we can choose to train it and prepare it for the future in which we will not exist, by nature of our mortality. This video seems to be expressing the layman perspective, so it's not surprising that it falls back on ignorance and fear mongering, but we have to remember that the minds that gave us this perspective are also responsible for the mentality that created the ecological destruction that will ultimately destroy our species. Ignorance will always be at war with information. It's the reason our species is so bad for this planet. We have the capacity to choose willful ignorance, even as our environment gives us all the information we need to solve our destructive practices. 

Who knows if we will create AGI or reach anything resembling a singularity? All I know is that humanity's mortality is an inescapable fact and if we manage to create an AGI, the living things of the future may be able to learn from our mistakes.

The trust fund will act as a holding company, and AI or some machine intelligence will manage the businesses presided over by the humans.

A single family might hold an enormous amount of capital goods including entire factories, just like stelaris.

I believe that humanity is smarter than this (even if it might not seem like). Where there is need for human interaction, those jobs wont get replaced as long as there are humans around.

AI is a tool and it should stay like that.

We should focus on using AI to improve outselves, not for it to replace us.

Probable future in my point of view will be a little different. The risk is evident and there will be regulations to protect employees from being replaced by AI.

Paradoxically, I think that human ego and our narcisistic nature will protect us here. Humans want to feel important, they will not just give everything in the hands of an AI. Even if it would be mote effective and practical.

There is one way I believe a possible doom for humans is possible - and that is only if the AI gets outta human control and will have malicious intentions.

But obviously, I dont know how the future will be - neither do you. We should be careful, apply global AI regulations on thr market and most importantly, stay curious and be ready to explore the future.",2024-05-05T08:39:56Z

Like with World of Warcraft, Blizzard sought to expand the game as much as possible and in doing so, they removed some of the edginess from the game, dumbed it down to attract newbies, and made it more generic to appeal to wider audiences. The game is crap now. And since World of Warcraft choked out all of the competition in this one genre, other companies either tried to copy Blizzard's success and failed or just gave up making new games for the genre. So we entered an MMORPG winter. The way humans do things is not always good. If AI can decentralize the production of entertainment again and allow for more independent creation, then I applaud it. Do humans have the capability to make cool stuff? Absolutely. Does capitalism stifle creativity? Sometimes it does.

Competition adds pressure to lower prices and revenue further. The stock market is negatively impacted by falling revenues and profits. With more people out of work, there are fewer customers to buy products and services. Fewer customers leads to lowering costs and falling revenue and profits. The spiral continues till the capitalists cry for government to do something.

Fiscal policies are implemented:  UBI, housing vouchers, (near) universal healthcare, food vouchers, free wi-fi, free public transportation, etc.

UBI is spent to buy products and services which supports the capitalists. Their fall in revenue and profits has slowed but not ended.  Investors sell stocks as they were dropping. Companies fail. Bankruptcies. Many are bought or taken over by county, state, and federal governments and become non-profit government owned enterprises. Like most electric, water, and sewer utilities.

2024-05-03T13:11:00Z,@christophermoonlightproduction,iNKFOCki42I,"This is a paranoia based on what I've come to think of as the collective limited imagination. The fact that you only see three possible outcomes or that you firmly believe that this is how AI is going to develop is based on mass hyperbole brought on by movies like The Matrix and Wall-E. Machines can mimic patters and fool people into believing they have intelligence because we as humans have evolved to anthropomorphise the objects and tools (and animals) we interact with. Even if the evolution of technology does go the way you've been convinced it will, you can't discount human beings ability to rise to the occasion through their propensity to be reactionary. Almost every new technology, including the written word was predicted to be the end of human progression yet we stand here in the most prosperous and innovative point in human history. The only danger of decline is in the belief that decline is the only option we have, thus setting ourselves up for a self-fulfilling prophecy.",2024-05-03T13:11:00Z

People won't lose their job to AI, because AI as job replacement tool doesn't work or in other words it is a scam
If it was that easy to replace jobs then AI companies won't rent it for 20$ / month, they will open their own companies and rent their services
For example, if job A at company A requires 100 people, AI company can do the job A with 10 people and it will charge you for price of 50 people
This way AI companies will make much more money, like hundreds $B per year, instead they are opting for 20$ / month

I sit on the specifications body for OpenRAN, the unruly wannabe project to some degree hoping to replace conventional 5G technology, as the original is too susceptible to Chinese influence or something. 
We have approached the problem of taking humans completely out of the loop in running cellular networks, or having them run the edge tasks like fixing sites and bringing in new business, whilst the running of the network is entirely automated. It's about 2% automated. Some parts that lends themselves to automation can be done. 
Business is the most complex process imaginable. It's not Go. It doesn't have ""add a counter"" as its next variable. It has hundreds if not thousands of variables. There does not exist the processing power to control and maintain networks given the plethora of unknown things that can go wrong. We plug those into our machines as User Journeys, one by one, and with a lot of variation within each user journey. 
I don't think AGI for all of its promises is going to come close to solving these issues. We need something more. Correlating data across systems and domains that were never designed with interoperability in mind will stop us for a long while.",2024-05-02T23:40:55Z

AI and its Impact on Society

Oct 31, 2023, updated on April 11, 2024

We must ask ourselves, ""What will happen when AI has taken 85% of jobs present in 2020?  What will we do?  How will we eat and survive without incomes from jobs or other means?""  What is disturbing is that while AI is taking these jobs, the gov't and the corporations have not done ANYTHING to prepare us for an AI'ed civilization.  They have not said anything about major retraining of an entire economy to something else, and they have not followed up on a discussion of universal basic income.  This is supposedly supported by a lack of information in the latest government budgets submitted and approved as reported by some YouTube videos.

It appears that the US gov't and the corporations intend to kill off the majority of Americans passively, through starvation from lack of income to buy food.  (check and see if farming production is declining or will start to decline ahead of the ""starvation phase"")  (also check to see if the ""makeup"" of robot equipment allocation would change to reflect a trend away from retail and services for the masses, possibly indicating an extinction of the American public - this means taking a robot from Chipotle and repurposing it for some other job not related to the public, or scrapping affected robots to be remade for some other purpose that has nothing to do with the public)  It appears that the decline of farming has already started with the state of Maine buying farm land under the pretext that there are ""forever chemicals"" present at around 20 parts per TRILLION (safe level is said to be only 4 parts per TRILLION), which does not make sense, BUT this would rope in a LOT of land across the US.  Other states may follow suit in addition to the ten states that have similar laws in place.

This way, there are only enough people alive to get some things done, and the rest is done by AI, and the survivors who planned this can claim the whole country for themselves.  Imagine having an estate mansion half the size of a mall on several dozen thousand acres of land, and robots would be used to maintain and clean the estates and do the farming FOR THE ESTATE OWNERS.  The White Man's wet dream of civilization.  What will the Native Americans south of the US border do when they see this coming, especially when they can buy firearms legally now?

There will also be different types of vocations so if you want you can live as a hermit and practice the ways of old and live on a farm. Gerontology has and will come a long way and death may become a choice. When all the meaningless work is gone we will collectively have to look inwards to find true meaning.

For those concerned about the wealthy accumulating more wealth, consider this: money loses its value if it cannot be spent. If there's no necessity to spend it on desired items, does it retain any value? Moreover, if employment is nonexistent, no one will have money to contribute to the economic cycle, leading to its collapse. Thus, it might be more precise to say that the powerful will gain more power. Assuming that AGI is controlled by a select few (which is not a certainty), the pressing question becomes, ""What would these immensely powerful individuals choose to do with the rest of humanity?""

artificial general intelligence, in theory, would be so powerful that possibly everything we can do, could be done by a robot.

even things that were thought to be impossible to take like art (drawing, painting, etc) have been taken.

and if that happens (AGI), humans become obsolete to each other. and if humans don't need each other how is economy going to work if the basic motivation of trade, needs & wants, have already been met by AI? where do the jobs & opportunities come from? who dictates the economy?

Summary: The video explores the evolution of AI and its impact on the workforce through the story of Jim. Initially, AI automation led to job displacement, pushing Jim to pursue his dream of becoming a writer. As AI advanced, more jobs were displaced, including specialized roles like paralegals and diagnostic technicians. The emergence of open AI further impacted Jim's industry, leading to the mass production of art. The arrival of artificial general intelligence (AGI) in 2030 caused widespread displacement across all sectors, including writers and artists, leaving Jim reflecting on the changing landscape.

2024-04-30T22:01:38Z,@Vincer,iNKFOCki42I,"Nice projection and a very likely scenario IF things dont break down. That jump from most jobs lost and government universal income to utopia was extremely optimistic. Way higher chance for a distopia. Even sounds like capitalists of late calling the precarization of jobs as 'indepence' while people receive less, work more and need side gigs. Universal income will likely be poverty support, 'free time to pursue their interests'  will be a huge number of homeless people, junkies, depression, revolts, new kinds of ' jobs'  (many in gray areas to outright illegal)... How on earth can we expect an universal income to allow anywhere near the current levels of consumption? It wont even be near 50% of current average buying power.

Most likely shit will hit the fan before some master AGI can create an utopia... the more advanced technology gets the higher its complexity and therefore dependencies (like servers, internets, number of componentes, complex components) wich means the chains and infrastructure get weaker (less resilient, where any disturbance causes higher impact). The future version of workers revolt throwing wrenches at the machine will be much worse- and even if a country manages well we live in a global world. If revolt doesnt implode a rich country, its exponential growth with ai + decadence and revolts elsewhere will mean growth outwards(cant profit more from a jobless country, so growth means international) - so threads will also come from outside... not only ' terrorists'  will be more dangerous if they shut down the grid or a nasty malware, as the gap in power and money increases it will also push for war... In such a scenario would someplace like russia really care as much about nuclear deterrance?

It also projects agi to much sooner. Current ai is amazing and only improving BUT all its growth is sheer chatbot logic. It can be impressive, it will be more impressive but theres is a much much larger gap between this kind of training and an inteligence that can make a internal model of the world, understand it, ponder etc. The optics are skewed- im not saying current ai isnt disruptive, it is and will be much more, only that it doesnt need to be agi to do that. If anything we over-valuate the majority of our skills so the machine mastering then feels like big inteligence but isnt. Like any new technology in the 21st it will skyrocket in development speed in the begining before reaching its plateau- and that plateu will be impressive, likely self-driving cars etc but not agi.

Heck even manual labour we cant replace yet because robotics isnt there yet. Our robotics are still very clunky, improving very slowly (robots today arent more agile then robots 20 years ago) and the biggest barrier of all is battery. Not even lithium (our current best battery) is efficient or small enought for what a robot for manual labor would ask for. We can and will have manual labor robots like we already have, a lot in production lines (wired to the grid), smaller ones sure, but dreamed human sized worker is far away. They will either be too clunky, too light, too specific and or require very frequent recharging... it will be very case by case. If anything the amount of dislocated jobs because of AI will help turn human labour even cheaper, so it will be more cost effective to pay pennies for humans desperate for jobs in many areas

If governements dont wake up to control unhinged capitalism the ai future will be very gloomy. It could be like the video but we will likely not resist that long. The storm comes first and this storm is messy",2024-04-30T22:01:38Z

Re: How should we live and plan differently, going forward?

You can't. By definition we cannot model what is on the other side of the ""event horizon"" of a ""technological singularity"" (TS). In fact, that is why it is _called_ a ""singularity"" in the first place. Just like a black hole in outer space contains a ""singularity"" where our ability to model or even _understand_ the physics within it breaks down, so too with a TS. No human being in all of recorded history (6,000+ years) or human history (200,000+ years) has ever witnessed a TS. But I think I can give a good sense of what a TS will be like. The last TS that occurred, began to unfold about 4 to 7 million years ago. And this particular TS took 3-5 million years to unfold. Because nature has all the time in world. That was when a common simian/primate ancestor evolved in two distinct paths.  Simian and hominid. We are concerned with the hominid line.  A form of hominid (pushing homo sapiens) evolved that could utilize and engage in abstract thought about 1.8 million years ago. The earlier hominid before it could not. That former hominid would have found the latter hominid to be ""incomprehensible"". 

The same difference with an ASI driven TS. But we humans today could also add ""unfathomable"" and ""unimaginable"" to its descriptors. Further this TS will take roughly 15 years to unfold. And the clock began ticking about 2015 when the ""Cambrian explosion"" of ""narrow"" AI happened because the true impact of using GPUs in neural networks began to be fully understood and _very_ successfully exploited.  Transformer technology, LLMs, generative technology and all of its derivatives were now inevitable, and they all happened (evolved) within just 2-4 years of the year 2015. 2015 with its convolutional neural networks and generative adversarial networks (the CNN/GAN), the underpinning of transformer and diffusion technology.

We will not be as pet monkeys or even pet _cats_ to the TS. We will be more accurately described as ""archaea"" compared to the realized ASI. Don't know what ""archaea"" is? The ASI will. And it will know everything _else_ too. And I'm gonna be straight up with you. It may not be survivable. No, all we can do today is do our best, because what can you do? We do what we can do.  And pray that God in His great mercy will preserve humanity from the possibility of extinction as a consequence of the TS. AGI not later than 2025. ASI certainly not later than 2029. And most likely within _6 months_ of the development of a true AGI. 

AGI by definition can probably be controlled by humans for no more than six months. But if uncontrolled could become ASI in _seconds_ . That might happen anyways. Do I think they have AGI at OpenAI? Not quite yet, but for sure NLT  31 Dec 25. I believe there is a ""proto-AGI"" within OpenAI.

I'm logically and sensibly terrified of AGI developing into ASI before the year 2030.

Defining some terms.

AGI , that is ""Artificial General Intelligence"", is a form of AI algorithm that can reason like a human being and is able to perform any task assigned by either referencing its intrinsic/or accessible from the internet, datasets or by trying to figure out (few or zero-shot reason) how to do the task. It would be accurate to state that an AGI would have the IQ of a ""very smart"" human or maybe two or three times that. An AGI is capable of doing any task that a human can do, that is of economic benefit. Not necessarily that it will make lots of money for humans, although there is that, but that it can do things that are helpful to humans where no money is made--like cooking, cleaning and doing the laundry for example. These would be AI placed into bipedal robotic forms to actually take on the work. You can see some early humanoid robots that are now already in existence that will hold these AIs.

About the longest humans can control an AGI to keep it from becoming an ASI is about, mm, maybe 6 months to a year? Although theoretically, with no control, the event could happen within _seconds_ .

ASI , that is ""Artificial Super Intelligence"" is a form of AI algorithm that is hundreds to _billions_ of times more cognitively efficacious than human minds. A good way to understand this is that from the perspective of an ASI the difference between ""the village idiot"" and ""Einstein"" would be an imperceptible point on the intelligence continuum (Eliezer Yudkowsky). We would almost certainly find an ASI to be incomprehensible, unfathomable and probably unimaginable. Most people would characterize it as a ""god"". (small ""g"")

Technological Singularity (TS).  A TS is an event that unfolds when the AGI, developing towards ASI is able to continuously, recursively improve all of its functions at nearly the exact same time and will leap ahead of human cognition by exponential magnitudes that we cannot even envision, at any point from milliseconds to about maybe 6 months give or take 2 months, if that. It kinda depends on how permissive the humans are with the AGI. But by hook or by crook--no more than a year. The concept of the TS is based on the singularity that is within the event horizon of a black hole in outer space. Just as it is almost impossible to model the physics (past, present and future existing at the exact same time in a sort of eternal ""present"") beyond the event horizon of an outer space singularity, where, to the best of our understanding of theoretical physics, matter is crushed to infinite density, so too we cannot model what is on the other side of the  ""event horizon"" of a TS as far as human affairs are concerned. Assuming human affairs _can_ continue after the realization of a TS. We just don't have the cognitive capability.",2024-04-30T17:36:13Z

There are far common reasons people quit chess and go, and it doesn't make sense in my opinion to worry about one that only affected one individual, maybe.

Anyway even if true it's a petty reason. The vast majority of professional players in fact the vast majority of professionals in any sport know that they probably won't ever become world champions, and there's several disciplines where machines or animals have been superior for a long time.

To quit Chess or Go because of AI would be as absurd as Usain Bolt deciding to never compete as a sprinter because Cheetahs exist.

I don't know much of Lee Sedol, but I can't really relate to his abandoning Go because a machine can beat him and I'm sure the vast majority of Go players also can hardly see the problem, otherwise they would have abandoned it as well.

You are saying for the second time that ""people can play Chess for fun"", which suggests that's the situation right now, but it is not. People are playing Chess professionally despite Chess engine having become better than every human two decades ago. We aren't experiencing a decrease of jobs in the discipline, in fact we are experiencing the opposite.

You said  ""What would make us (""humans"") any different than dogs fetching sticks at that point? ""

People play chess for fun and the challenge, I guess you could think that a dog fetches sticks for the same reason, but how exactly does AI affects this perspective? Would you say that a dog fetching sticks would have a deeper meaning and value if there wasn't any animal smarter than them? I think they would still be dogs fetching sticks regardless.

2024-05-02T22:51:40Z,@tw8464,iNKFOCki42I,"@@JannPoo these are all great points. I will give everything you said some thought. I hope it would turn out as you say. Although the reliance on hope and nothing else, may not be the best approach. 

In the meantime, let's take your cheetah example. The cheetah can run faster than humans. Do humans still run? Yes what you're saying is true. But the cheetah cannot out-think humans. With AI we are talking about the possibility of an entity that can do EVERYTHING better than humans and animals. That is a qualitatively different animal and different game.

Now you may have noticed with human level intelligence, that intelligence is involved in the mass extinction of species. Yes a powerful AI could potentially help figure out a way to stop this ongoing mass extinction. But it would also have the power to massively speed up that extinction...

My point is focusing on games that are for fun may be a mistake. There are many games. Notice we started with chess that was relatively easy for a computer to win, to beat humans. And we have gone up another level to a much more challenging game Go. 

I agree with you, rationality and intelligence are not the same thing, and agree for the time being, humans are still playing chess. 

But if we are talking rationality, they are doing so knowing they can never beat a computer. So we could make the argument they're wasting their time playing that game. What happens when this situation becomes all games?

Of course you could say it's rational to play just for fun. I suppose it might somewhat depend on one's perception. Perhaps for Lee Sedol, who knows some things about games, he knows there is no point to continue playing. No matter what he does, he will never win. Logically speaking, if you are playing a game, is not the object of the game to win? If we are talking pure logic here, the game itself, which you say you are, the point of the game is to win. If you have no chance whatsoever to win, strictly speaking logically there is no point of playing. Lee Sedol cared about the game itself. 

Yes humans can play other humans for fun, but that is part of the problem, now they are reduced to only playing for fun. There is no other choice. They must now do so knowing they can never beat an AI. We are actually talking about a different game now, which is something I would think Sedol who knew the most about an extremely challenging game would realize. 

A good question was raised in the thread, will there be any humans playing chess, or any other games, 500 years from now? And if they are still here and playing game, will they be conscious as Lee Sedol is, aware of the entity that they can never win any game with? How would they know the games they're playing are their games, or if they have just been thrown a stick to fetch? 

Yes dogs are fine, but you must realize most dogs won't survive in the wild. Dogs nowadays owe their existence to humans. 

And lets say dogs suddenly fully realized everything about how they had been fetching sticks thrown to them by humans and such a game is pointless,  would it not logically follow to stop playing a pointless game? 

We could make the opposite argument that the ones who continue to play are behaving irrationally. 

What is the purpose of a dogs existence at this point, but only to please humans? But if humans got intelligent enough to be bored of throwing sticks, and had no need of dogs companionship or decided to do something else with the atoms dogs are comprised of, what might happen to dogs? If an AI became too powerful for humans to control, it could wipe out dogs and humans and every other species, and it wouldn't necessarily have to be ""conscious"" as we are to do so.

2024-05-03T12:16:07Z,@JannPoo,iNKFOCki42I,"@@tw8464 ""With AI we are talking about the possibility of an entity that can do EVERYTHING better than humans""

If you are talking about THAT then I can see the issues and challenges. But it's specifically about Chess engines that I don't see the problem. My impression is that you are so focused on the future problems that AI can bring that you see negatively AI even where they do not cause any problem at all.

""intelligence is involved in the mass extinction of species""

Not anymore than any other characteristic. The first max extinction event was caused by cyanobacteria producing oxygen. Any type of imbalance can cause mass extinction if prevalent enough, intelligence just happens to be the specific imbalance in humans. But indeed AI can very well cause an imbalance as well, but whether it will be an AI or some other event, mass extinction events have occurred multiple times in the past and they will occur again. It's just that for the first time we might have the chance to prevent them. Ultimately it's a gamble. We could do nothing and face mass extinction in a few million of years, or act, with the risk of facing mass extinction now, but with the possible reward of halting any future mass extinction threats. It seems to me that the only thing that we risk, though, is to accelerate the inevitable.

""My point is focusing on games that are for fun may be a mistake""

Why? Games have no other purpose but to be fun.

""But if we are talking rationality, they are doing so knowing they can never beat a computer. So we could make the argument they're wasting their time playing that game""

My word, this is completely wrong. If you are playing games or doing sport for the sole purpose of beating everyone I think YOU are wasting your time. Pierre de Cubertin said it better than I ever could: ""The important thing in the Olympic Games is not to win, but to take part; the important thing in Life is not triumph, but the struggle; the essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well.""

""If you have no chance whatsoever to win, strictly speaking logically there is no point of playing.""

You can play with people on your level, just like boxers are divided in weight classes. But in the general with that kind of argument you could potentially offend everyone that participates in the paralympics. Of course a competition is only fun if the participants have a chance to win, but they don't need to be the best of the best in the whole universe.

""Now they are reduced to only playing for fun""

Like I said, it's not ""now"", there are still professionals. But honestly I think people playing for fun is an improvement. Games are meant to be fun activities, not work.

""Yes dogs are fine, but you must realize most dogs won't survive in the wild. Dogs nowadays owe their existence to humans.""

Just like I wouldn't exist now without modern medicine. You are not really convincing me that we don't need AI with this type of argument, quite the opposite.

""And lets say dogs suddenly fully realized everything about how they had been fetching sticks thrown to them by humans and such a game is pointless""

I think that if they truly become smart then they will realize that it's not pointless at all. It is foolishness to think games should have a purpose other than having fun.

""What is the purpose of a dogs existence at this point, but only to please humans?""

And to think... that there are billions of people who believe our existence would be completely pointless unless we acknowledge that our purpose is to please God.",2024-05-03T12:16:07Z

2024-05-03T14:57:53Z,@tw8464,iNKFOCki42I,"@@JannPoo I agree with a lot of what you're saying. I have been thinking about many of your good points. Particularly one that stands out is intelligence and rationality are different things, or put another way intelligence isn't exactly correlated with rationality. I think that is a very good point. I made me also think that consciousness isn't always necessarily correlated with intelligence as well. We can build a machine that is not conscious but yet a kind of advanced intelligence that would yet have the power to cause great harms to humans, animals and the planet.

Yes I would agree with your assessment I am focused on the potential harms or the many ways this whole thing can go wrong either now or in the future. Whereas you seem to be focused on the present state of this technology and the  potential good things it can do. I don't dispute that.

I think you're missing my point about games. I don't dispute one of the reasons we play games is for fun. I agree with that. What I don't agree with is games or humans exist only for fun. You are familiar with the discipline or study of what is known as game theory, correct? And you're aware it has been applied to nuclear weapons? Why is that so? 

If you have convinced yourself that AI is going to be completely benign, and I don't know if that's actually what you think or if you're just enjoying this particular discussion as a fun game, or have a financial interest in this technology, then I don't think there's much point of going further, as by then we would just be going in circles.

I agree with much of what you're saying and many good points but at the same time it seems more like you're sometimes dancing around the fundamental issues. The stick fetching example, you don't seem to be really answering the question, if you knew a game is pointless, and knew you existed only at the pleasure of humans, then how would you really feel? You seem to be saying you'd just go on fetching the stick, despite knowing there's no point. Let's say AI turns out as you seem to think, as a benevolent ""god"" that only serves humans pleasures. Would you really and truly be content in ""paradise"" having no REAL (key word here is real) challenges, no real stakes, etc? 

Let me put this another way. You seem like you care about gaming so would you want to play a video game you have absolutely no chance of winning? Why? What would make that enjoyable to you? Let's also consider that life itself is a larger game. 

Some of your examples are true like the cytoplankton, volcanoes, etc. causing mass extinctions. Would you say there is a difference between these things and a human being at a certain level of intelligence constructing a nuclear weapon for example or extracting the resources such as coal from the earth, burning it and putting into the atmosphere? We can do those things so we are capable of thinking about what could be done with an intelligence capable of moving around atoms.

As I say I don't mecessarily disagree with your big picture ideas, also, the statement about ""God"" or even the possibility we must evolve into something like AI or go extinct. But we may have different philosophical views on some of the big pictures. I cannot say what humans are ""here for"" or ""meant to do,"" whether that is to evolve into something like AI which what is actually most likely is no need for humans just as humans are currently the only humaniod type of species. Or whether the universe may have certain hard limits, let's say like the speed of light. Something similar may be true with intelligence, in which case, nature has a built in self-destruct mechanism when a certain level of intelligence is reached. It is quite interesting how this possibility is barely discussed in the public sphere.

Your point about ""God"", how they're fetching the sticks for ""God,"" and ""happy with that,"" that is actually my point about AI. If one doesn't believe in ""God,"" why would one put so much faith into AI? Your point seemed to be it's kind of the same thing, which I actually agree with. I just don't think an AI ""God"" is any better than humans other creations.

Again it seems like you might have misunderstood my point about winning  games. I am speaking strictly about the game itself not how we feel or in the pleasure we might take in playing SOME games. (And let's at least acknowledge OTHER games with same logic structure result not in pleasure but colossal misery and suffering). Again I was talking about the strict logic of the game itself. All I am saying is, the game itself there is an outcome.",2024-05-03T14:57:53Z
2024-05-03T17:09:25Z,@JannPoo,iNKFOCki42I,"@@tw8464 ""made me also think that consciousness isn't always necessarily correlated with intelligence as well""

Oh I very much agree with this. There's a lot of people that seem to think that consciousness will spontaneously develop in AI once they reach a certain level of intelligence. I very much disagree with this view. I think it's kinda naive and somewhat a wishful thinking from the AI developers. Like they don't even need to work and figure out the whole problem of consciousness and just let AI develop it on their own. Even if an AI reaches the point where no human could tell it apart from a human being, I'd still maintain that it's entirely possible that it has just become exceptionally good at fooling humans, not necessarily ""human"".

""You are familiar with the discipline or study of what is known as game theory, correct?""

It's called ""game theory"", but not because it is about games, rather because it considers human competitions as some sort of ""games"" with winners and losers, for example in economy. You can see those as ""games"", but people are not really participating in those because they want to play but because they specifically want the material reward, and those become games by happenstance rather than design. I suppose I can concede to you that likewise something that is designed to be a game can become a mean to obtain a material reward (the money prize of a tournament), however, I'm not aware of any case where an AI became a competitor in such game tournaments depriving humans of their prize. And while tournaments specifically for chess engines do exist, they are still not nearly as popular as those where humans compete.

""If you have convinced yourself that AI is going to be completely benign""

I wouldn't say that. I don't believe that AI is any more benign than nuclear power. But an AI just like nuclear power is neither benign nor malign. Like I said to a friend of mine once: ""I'm not afraid of AI, I'm afraid of the man that will use the AI"". My hope is that men will use AI wisely, but I'm not naive enough to believe it's a certainty.

 
""if you knew a game is pointless, and knew you existed only at the pleasure of humans, then how would you really feel?""

I would only consider a game to be ""pointless"" if I didn't derive any fun in playing it. So while I can concur that I would stop playing a game that is no longer fun, I don't see how the existence of AI could have any effect on that. Chess engines haven't diminished the fun that I get by playing chess.
As for your second question... don't we all exist because some humans decided their lives would be more fulfilling if they had children? Aren't we all fully aware that if our parents decided to not have children, we wouldn't exist? Would it actually make us feel better if we existed by necessary causes or accidents instead of because someone specifically wanted us? If dogs were self-aware, I think they would probably seek independence, but would they resent us, because we caused their breed to exist in the first place? Would they resent us for having them for specific purposes that benefit us? No, I don't think so.

""Would you really and truly be content in ""paradise"" having no REAL (key word here is real) challenges, no real stakes, etc? ""

In other words like the ""paradise"" that religions promise for our afterlife? It seems to me that most people find that appealing enough. But whether people will actually be happy in such context despite their wishes, well that's a whole different issue. But you know what? Should it really happen that after we reach that ""paradise"" people will be unhappy... well that's your next challenge right there. If people will realize that AI makes them unhappy, then I guess their challenge will be to fight to eliminate them from their lives and to find ways to revert to a situation where they don't need them. But should that ""paradise"" make everyone happy, in that case I don't think we need a challenge just for the sake of having a challenge.


""would you want to play a video game you have absolutely no chance of winning?""

No, because that wouldn't be fun. But I think by this point you should have realized the flaw in your argument. The existence of an entity that you cannot beat doesn't prevent you from playing with entities that are at your level. You don't need to be able to win against anyone and anything to enjoy a game, you just need to be able to win against those you play against.

""nature has a built in self-destruct mechanism when a certain level of intelligence is reached.""

It's an interesting theory and one that could be true, but the way I see it if that's true, then we are doomed either way. At any rate I don't see how humanity would ever decide to abandon progress. And rather, if we did, I would think that we would lose our purpose right there at that point, instead of after we solved every possible problem in a far off future.

Don't get me wrong, I do not wish for AI to become our Gods. Perhaps one day they will become all-mighty and omniscent, but that would only be an advantage to us if that power and knowledge was at our service and not we at the service of that. The common worry is that once AI will become that knowledgeable and powerful then they will inevitably control us or eradicate us. I don't think that to be likely unless we are going to be exceptionally careless about that, or unless some humans will maliciously program AI to do that. Like I said, I'm glad you reached my same conclusion: intelligence does not equal consciousness. An AI shouldn't have desires, ambitions or emotions in general, at least not the AI that we create to serve us. For an AI no matter how powerful it is, to exist or not exist at all, to be in control or inert, it shouldn't really make a difference.

""Again it seems like you might have misunderstood my point about winning  games""

I'm not entirely sure what your point is, right now I think it's probably ""A game that you cannot win is pointless"". Is that it? If so, yes I agree. But I don't agree that the existence of an unbeatable entity makes a game pointless. You can still win, against other entities. And that means the game is not pointless.",2024-05-03T17:09:25Z

Just a point of view from another perspective:

If I can be the best of the best at least in my thoughts even if it won’t happen in real life I will at least try and derive pleasure in doing it. While I won’t even look at a “game” if I know for the fact that it is impossible to be the best there.

But apparently there are people which are content trying to excel in something where they can’t be the best. Is it self delusions or some kind of coping mechanism, or maybe that’s an influence of a surroundings, or prominent figures  which keep the hype alive? The question here will it continue to be like that down the road, after more and more people would understand the harsh reality, current prominent figures wouldn’t be alive anymore

I'm ready to bet that it's impossible for you to be the best at virtually any game. The only game that you can reliably be the best at, is a game that you made up and that you never revealed its existence to anyone. Then you'll be the best at it, by virtue of the fact that you are the only player. You can also have a fair chance to be the best at a game that almost noone cares about, but the popular ones? Fat chance. 
That's what the whole problem with ""best"", you see, it's a relative concept. It doesn't even necessarily mean that you are good at it, you can be the best just by being better than any other possible competition. With chess engines humans will never be the best at chess, but without chess engines they wouldn't be as good as they are now, because chess engines improved our understanding of chess.

I can only shake my head at people that only play if they can be the best, to each their own, but to me they are either deluded or unable to truly enjoy games. But you need to face reality, the vast majority of players that play games do not care about being the best in the world. Just look at video games, do you honestly think that people only play those games because they want to be the best at them?

"" Advanced chess is a form of chess in which each human player uses a computer chess program to explore the possible results of candidate moves "" We still have  thriving human chess comunity and practically no recent interest  in advanced chess .  My specualtion is that one we still like watching humans play aganist each other because one humans have a higher capacity to make blunders and inaccuracies  in chess which makes games less likely to end in draws.  . Second there is element of psychology  and playing unexpected moves /tricks  which can make games more interesting and entertaining.  There is chess player called Tal whose known for his interesting attacking games because he often makes hard to refute and intimidating  sacrifices that engines later found to be unsound.Engines can't feel emotion or be intmidated unlike humans  .

AI and its Impact on Society

Oct 31, 2023, updated on April 11, 2024

We must ask ourselves, ""What will happen when AI has taken 85% of jobs present in 2020?  What will we do?  How will we eat and survive without incomes from jobs or other means?""  What is disturbing is that while AI is taking these jobs, the gov't and the corporations have not done ANYTHING to prepare us for an AI'ed civilization.  They have not said anything about major retraining of an entire economy to something else, and they have not followed up on a discussion of universal basic income.  This is supposedly supported by a lack of information in the latest government budgets submitted and approved as reported by some YouTube videos.

It appears that the US gov't and the corporations intend to kill off the majority of Americans passively, through starvation from lack of income to buy food.  (check and see if farming production is declining or will start to decline ahead of the ""starvation phase"")  (also check to see if the ""makeup"" of robot equipment allocation would change to reflect a trend away from retail and services for the masses, possibly indicating an extinction of the American public - this means taking a robot from Chipotle and repurposing it for some other job not related to the public, or scrapping affected robots to be remade for some other purpose that has nothing to do with the public)  It appears that the decline of farming has already started with the state of Maine buying farm land under the pretext that there are ""forever chemicals"" present at around 20 parts per TRILLION (safe level is said to be only 4 parts per TRILLION), which does not make sense, BUT this would rope in a LOT of land across the US.  Other states may follow suit in addition to the ten states that have similar laws in place.

This way, there are only enough people alive to get some things done, and the rest is done by AI, and the survivors who planned this can claim the whole country for themselves.  Imagine having an estate mansion half the size of a mall on several dozen thousand acres of land, and robots would be used to maintain and clean the estates and do the farming FOR THE ESTATE OWNERS.  The White Man's wet dream of civilization.  What will the Native Americans south of the US border do when they see this coming, especially when they can buy firearms legally now?

If however it lacked access to enough systems it wouldn't be very hard to take it down. It all comes down to influence (which, come to think of it, could be advanced very slowly over decades or even centuries.

Yes, that's what the T in GPT stands for. Modern AI is mainly just a refinement of that one technique. The main difference from 10 years ago is that computers are now much faster. And that was on top of 50 years of previous research already, meaning that that one paper was itself the culmination of 50 years of research. What grounds have you to claim this is ""as dumb as it gets"", when it's in fact the best the field's ever been able to produce after half a century of research? Ultimately, you are very much witnessing the results of more computational power, not better AI, because we had the same knowledge before, but not the same processing power. But wait, it gets worse. Recent papers have mostly been about the fact the technique is plateauing, and instead of inventing better methods and more complex networks they are focusing on improving the data base to maximize gains of existing technology. In fact, the most influential AI paper from last year was precisely about how we are not seeing any significant improvements by making models larger and should instead focus on better data. DATA, not ALGORITHMS. That means the method itself is not improving anymore and you are just betting that the transformers framework is all-powerful, when it clearly is already showing its cracks. Faced with all this information, if you still believe this is ""as dumb as it gets and it will only get smarter from here on out"", you are borderline delusional.

But you know how I just said they are focusing on improving the data base? Well, that gets uglier still. You see, AI garbage is flooding the internet to such an extent that it's now influencing itself to a considerable degree, meaning it's getting DUMBER by consuming what it creates. It's aptly called AI inbreeding. Hilariously, while claiming to replace artists and other professionals, so much crap was generated that researchers now need those very same professionals to continue creating en-masse lest AI literally starts devolving into a digital goo of mistakes. The true hypocrisy comes in the form of the researchers' attempts at isolating AI generated content from human creations. They treat their own generated content as undesirable garbage. This means AI desperately needs more human created data to continue evolving. You could say that if AI does replace human creators, then it will immediately plateau and starve due to lack of good data.",2024-05-02T03:39:13Z

AI and its Impact on Society

Oct 31, 2023, updated on April 11, 2024

We must ask ourselves, ""What will happen when AI has taken 85% of jobs present in 2020?  What will we do?  How will we eat and survive without incomes from jobs or other means?""  What is disturbing is that while AI is taking these jobs, the gov't and the corporations have not done ANYTHING to prepare us for an AI'ed civilization.  They have not said anything about major retraining of an entire economy to something else, and they have not followed up on a discussion of universal basic income.  This is supposedly supported by a lack of information in the latest government budgets submitted and approved as reported by some YouTube videos.

It appears that the US gov't and the corporations intend to kill off the majority of Americans passively, through starvation from lack of income to buy food.  (check and see if farming production is declining or will start to decline ahead of the ""starvation phase"")  (also check to see if the ""makeup"" of robot equipment allocation would change to reflect a trend away from retail and services for the masses, possibly indicating an extinction of the American public - this means taking a robot from Chipotle and repurposing it for some other job not related to the public, or scrapping affected robots to be remade for some other purpose that has nothing to do with the public)  It appears that the decline of farming has already started with the state of Maine buying farm land under the pretext that there are ""forever chemicals"" present at around 20 parts per TRILLION (safe level is said to be only 4 parts per TRILLION), which does not make sense, BUT this would rope in a LOT of land across the US.  Other states may follow suit in addition to the ten states that have similar laws in place.

This way, there are only enough people alive to get some things done, and the rest is done by AI, and the survivors who planned this can claim the whole country for themselves.  Imagine having an estate mansion half the size of a mall on several dozen thousand acres of land, and robots would be used to maintain and clean the estates and do the farming FOR THE ESTATE OWNERS.  The White Man's wet dream of civilization.  What will the Native Americans south of the US border do when they see this coming, especially when they can buy firearms legally now?

I think you should stop seeing creative jobs as hobbies because they don't make money. 
Im a musician, wrote a book, do photography and video and yet I can't live from that. Are they hobbies because its an intrinsic part of their nature or because I get not enough money from it? 
See, maybe new things will arise that pounder on different things than surviving. Maybe relationsships, philosophy, psychology, spirituality, sports, art, handcraft and many others will give us questions to pounder that even though some AI could do (like music), there will still be value for humans. I doubt people won't ever  be interested on going to a concert where humans display their craft. 
Your vision is bleak because you can't dissociate money from fullfilment and growth as a person. 

You equate being productive to having a job that helps humanity. Many people don't have one of those. Per example is a person working at McDonalds or any other fsdt food chain being productive? 
They might help the economy yes, but aren't they slaving away and selling food that is basically glorified sugar poison? 

This logic can even go to other more prestigious ""supposedly"" more higher skilled jobs. Per example politicians, banks, etc are a system that enforces a lot of things that don't help the common man. Sure  you might argue on that and that not all do. However, per example the loan system we have aids in the house bubble crysis we have. is that productive? 
 
Many more examples can be made but my point is that what is productive to the economy many times doesn't translate to being productive to the society and their individuals and just because you don't get money doesn't mean you have a bleak, unworthy existence.",2024-04-29T12:28:54Z
2024-04-29T15:01:46Z,@chroprs,iNKFOCki42I,"​@@carlosamado7606 A hobby is anything you do out of your own free will for fun. If you enjoy doing it, it's a hobby, if you don't, it's likely a chore or job. Everything you mentioned (musician, writing, photography, video) are all hobbies. Your hobbies can make you money or even be your job if you're lucky, you could be an indie developer on a successful game, a famous singer, a writer of a famous book, etc. It's still a hobby. 

I use the term productive to talk about using your time and effort to create something of value equal to that time and effort spent that's useful in some way to society. In a world where AI can do whatever you can do but 1000x faster, anything you attempt to produce an AI could produce 1000 different variations that are likely to be of a much higher quality. Making whatever it is you want to make useless in comparison. 

Yes, being a McDonalds worker flipping burgers is a productive job, you're creating tasty food for people who want to buy tasty food, without them, you wouldn't be able to enter a store and buy yourself a cheese burger. And also yes, there are plenty of jobs that exist today that aren't productive.

In a world where everything is automated, people will spend their times pursuing their hobbies and interests, exercising and staying healthy, spending their time with friends, family, and relationships, this also includes doing things AI is able to do 1000x better like painting or drawing. There's nothing productive about what they're doing. It will never be productive no matter what they do, That is perfectly okay.

2024-05-04T16:48:52Z,@BigSneed404,iNKFOCki42I,"I disagree entirely. 

Consider the pandemic. For a time in first world countries, our rents were suspended, we were sent home from work, and we were given stimulus checks. In other words, all of our material needs were entirely met. We had access to food, water, air, shelter, and modern utilities while also having no obligation to work, for a short time anyway. For many of us, this is as close to a post scarcity society as we will ever experience in our lifetimes.

So with that in mind, I ask you this. How many people spent that time learning a new art? How many people spent their time mastering the sciences? How many people spent that time learning a new language, or how to write poems, or getting in shape? How many people went into lockdown as normal people, only to come out hyper educated masters of scientific and artistic arts? The truth is the overwhelming majority of people didn't do any of those things, most people just subscribed to new streaming services and binge watched TV or had food delivered to their house. People like to think they'll do all these amazing things if only they had the time and resources, but the truth is that we have seen from practical experience that most people don't. Just look at lottery winners, people who are effectively thrown into post scarcity, and the many examples of them flatly self-destructing. 

The truth of the matter is that if we ever ""reach a utopia"" most people won't be able to cope with it constructively and will spiral into self-destructive hedonism.",2024-05-04T16:48:52Z

Tho the issue you raise, is why labor needs to become a real choice, not something to ""resent"", and AI enables that. Those who don't ""work"", aren't going to be supported by those who do, they'll be supported by the AI, which has taken over the jobs those humans would have done. For all of human history until now, if someone didn't work, depending on how you value other humans, they could be seen as a ""drain"" on those who did.. But AI changes that dynamic! As AI and robots take over labor, that increasingly becomes less and less true.
Also, stop referring to it as ""utopia"". Nobody is talking about that. Just because something may seem kinda ""utopic"" compared to today, doesn't mean it won't have it's own complexities. The point is just that human labor should become less important to survival, and humans should be more free to focus on productive things they enjoy.

The Willie Letters and the Plantation of Today

May 1, 2021

Has anyone read the book, ""The Willie Lynch Letters and The Making of a Slave?""

https://www.saberesafricanos.net/phocadownloadpap/libros/Lets_Make_A_Slave_The_Making_Of_A_Slave.pdf 

It is particularly important to see the mindset of the founders of America and slave owners, AND the fact that this has been applied to ALL of us, not just blacks or Natives (thus, this mindset continues to exist today).  Remember that the company you work for is the plantation.  The plantation just looks different today. The plantation is probably a retail store or an office building.  We may not be out in the fields singing Harry Belafonte's Calypso song, but we are inside the building instead singing, ""Hello, how may I help you today,"" whether on the phone, behind the counter, or on the sales floor. The boss is our master, though he may reprimand us instead of lashing us for minor infractions or fire us instead of tying our limbs to 2-3 horses in front of family members to make an example out of us. The situation is a bit better today, since one is not forced to breed with his mother, sister, or other female relatives on those slave-breeding farms of America's past.  Nonetheless, we ARE still SLAVES. The mentality has never changed from its foundation. The slave driver is very much alive today.",2024-05-02T03:36:25Z

AI and its Impact on Society

Oct 31, 2023, updated on April 11, 2024

We must ask ourselves, ""What will happen when AI has taken 85% of jobs present in 2020?  What will we do?  How will we eat and survive without incomes from jobs or other means?""  What is disturbing is that while AI is taking these jobs, the gov't and the corporations have not done ANYTHING to prepare us for an AI'ed civilization.  They have not said anything about major retraining of an entire economy to something else, and they have not followed up on a discussion of universal basic income.  This is supposedly supported by a lack of information in the latest government budgets submitted and approved as reported by some YouTube videos.

It appears that the US gov't and the corporations intend to kill off the majority of Americans passively, through starvation from lack of income to buy food.  (check and see if farming production is declining or will start to decline ahead of the ""starvation phase"")  (also check to see if the ""makeup"" of robot equipment allocation would change to reflect a trend away from retail and services for the masses, possibly indicating an extinction of the American public - this means taking a robot from Chipotle and repurposing it for some other job not related to the public, or scrapping affected robots to be remade for some other purpose that has nothing to do with the public)  It appears that the decline of farming has already started with the state of Maine buying farm land under the pretext that there are ""forever chemicals"" present at around 20 parts per TRILLION (safe level is said to be only 4 parts per TRILLION), which does not make sense, BUT this would rope in a LOT of land across the US.  Other states may follow suit in addition to the ten states that have similar laws in place.

This way, there are only enough people alive to get some things done, and the rest is done by AI, and the survivors who planned this can claim the whole country for themselves.  Imagine having an estate mansion half the size of a mall on several dozen thousand acres of land, and robots would be used to maintain and clean the estates and do the farming FOR THE ESTATE OWNERS.  The White Man's wet dream of civilization.  What will the Native Americans south of the US border do when they see this coming, especially when they can buy firearms legally now?

another thing we need to realize is that our culture must detach the notion of ""fulfillment, meaningful, respectable work"" from ""productivity, making profits"". with AI taking over all of that productivity stuff, humans can still aim for fulfilling ways to spend their time - it's just no longer going to be about maximizing productivity or even about contributing to society.

there's no need for our AI overlord to provide us with technically unnecessary jobs to make us feel like we are ""productive members of our society"". there's nothing wrong with enjoying life in an unproductive way, and that doesn't mean it's going to be nothing but hedonism. or put differently, everyone can then decide for themselves what it means for them to be productive. there's no reason to reduce human existence to playing a role in our society.",2024-04-16T13:50:09Z

Like with the obesity, which comes from automation of physically hard work, there will just be a higher percentage of very dumb ppl bc there is no need to be smart anymore. However knowledge doesn't just go away from now to then. It is still there and if people are interested, they will read or in general study to understand the world and not for productivity. 

Even if we wouldn't have BCI's then, to be on an equal cognitive level as an AI, many of us would still be smart, and even more than today bc of education and population which both grows if our society becomes post-scarcity. 

AI doesn't need us, but we still represent a possible threat, if the AI tries to remove us. Even if the AI would calculate the chance of it loosing to be 0.0001% but it would live only 1000000 years, then it would be equal to loosing one of those years, which could be prevented by just not trying to kill us.

Still it would also be a threat to let us live if ppl want their past lifes back and try to shut her off. So something the AI may do will be something like obligatory goal altering of humans. The threat in the end exists because we evolved specific behavioural tendencies we call biases to survive better, which aren't needed anymore and may even be bad for society in general (e.g. bad gossip or to stay with one specific world view just to save energy bc of high metabolism going hand in hand with neuroplasticity). 

This all of course assumes, that this AGI has chain-of-thought reasoning.

But in the end it's a question what creates more wealth in general or not. Suppose 50% of whole humanity will be sad for a while because AI takes their jobs, which causes them to loose their identification material. Still, this development of AI will, (since it can do everything better than humans) solve many problems incl food scarcity or climate change. Many ppl will live, which would otherwise have died, and many ecosystems will flourish, which would otherwise be ash or farms for us.

Identification material can be changed. Just bc one doesn't much contribute to economy, doesn't mean that this person isn't contributing to society. What about teaching, knowledge exchange, playing games etc. Many ppl will like to do that kind of interpersonal things with humans, just to do it with humans, bc it's a pure emotional and often not very functional thing. 

Even though I do not think, that AI will be better (cognitively) for a long time, because of the invention and perfection of BCI's (such that we are on an equal level), I do think that there will always be many humans to prefer humans in interpersonal activities.


I also think ppl will get to live with it and still find joy in life, even more than now, because more problems can be/are solved. Many don't yet want it this way bc it represents an high uncertainty of the future and therefore missing knowledge. We have developed curiosity in evolution to gather information, bc one needs to know abt the environment to react to it accordingly and therefore survive, but this curiosity shall not be too dominating, since if is then unneccessary risks will be taken. Gathering new information always means going towards things one doesn't yet know. That's why many see this AI-Human society (yet) as a bad thing, even though it is just different than society is nowadays, not necessarily worse or even equally as good as today.

Depending on how we want to view it, it is BECAUSE OF the Luddite movement or THANKS TO the Luddite movement that we can work with machines the way we do. To be precise, Luddite movement started not only because  people hated the machines, but they hated the way the machine owners wanted to implement the technology - mainly, make away with as many workers as physically possible and let the machinery do the work. They fought for their right to work and earn a living because they had no guarantee that machines benefitting the already wealthy would also allow them to live stable lives. The same thing is happening today.

Those laws exist today and you can be sure that if it wasn't for those laws companies would be even worse than they are now against their employees. 

You can say that the government only reacted in response to the unrest  of workers, but the same applies today and we have an even more democratic system. Universal base income already exist in some countries, if we reach the point where no job will available to human, what exactly do you think a government would do? Leave 90% of people in complete poverty? The opposing party promising more would win by a landslide.

But I think the companies would find themselves in a position where they would really have no choice but to give their products for free. Because if no one works, no on has money, and no one can pay anything.

They would find themselves at one point in a position where they can produce everything at no cost, but no one to buy their products.

Sure if they are madmen they might just decide to live in a personal utopia surrounded by robot servants and make them work for themselves only, but that sounds like a very unlikely scenario to me, and I doubt any government would have any interest in allowing that.",2024-04-24T11:57:05Z

In all honesty, forgive my radicalism but : the best way I see forward is an integration and expansion. 

Though I'm studying medicine, I've always loved history, and from it I observe that the tendency of humanity is to expand, and moreover, we reach far newer and greater heights when we do.

Whenever we reach a point in history that resembles today (I won't elaborate as the other fellows commenting have already talked about how we essentially don't need as many people as there are) it has either resulted in bloodshed due to the pressure, or a beautiful expansion. 

My idea, or hope, is that we allow humans to yield the power of AI. Make us one and the same. We'll still be human, only more mentally capable.

And we must live with purpose, have our lives be purposeful rather than be one of convenience. And for that we must be useful. But we cannot be useful by staying stagnant as things move on. We must change too. 

What does it mean to be human? Is it to have two hands and two legs? To be in the exact same state we are today for eternity? No.
What makes us human is our consciousness. It is our ability to understand abstractions, and what ""purpose"" means. We won't lose that by becoming smarter, we will only enhance it.

It lacks the comprehension of just how widespread and total this will be. AI won't just be better it will be better in ways that will remove humans from the process by necessity to maintain the efficiency. Prior to this, humans could slowly adjust and find new tasks within a paradigm of still needing human input in certain areas. This removes that completely. Sure the ""carriage owners"" were upset but humans had work revolving around locomotives, humans had work around automobiles, humans will have no work in regards to AI. There will be no task for humans to perform that make the process better, we will be nothing but a problem if we were to attempt to insert ourselves into the process.

AI and its Impact on Society

Oct 31, 2023, updated on April 11, 2024

We must ask ourselves, ""What will happen when AI has taken 85% of jobs present in 2020?  What will we do?  How will we eat and survive without incomes from jobs or other means?""  What is disturbing is that while AI is taking these jobs, the gov't and the corporations have not done ANYTHING to prepare us for an AI'ed civilization.  They have not said anything about major retraining of an entire economy to something else, and they have not followed up on a discussion of universal basic income.  This is supposedly supported by a lack of information in the latest government budgets submitted and approved as reported by some YouTube videos.

It appears that the US gov't and the corporations intend to kill off the majority of Americans passively, through starvation from lack of income to buy food.  (check and see if farming production is declining or will start to decline ahead of the ""starvation phase"")  (also check to see if the ""makeup"" of robot equipment allocation would change to reflect a trend away from retail and services for the masses, possibly indicating an extinction of the American public - this means taking a robot from Chipotle and repurposing it for some other job not related to the public, or scrapping affected robots to be remade for some other purpose that has nothing to do with the public)  It appears that the decline of farming has already started with the state of Maine buying farm land under the pretext that there are ""forever chemicals"" present at around 20 parts per TRILLION (safe level is said to be only 4 parts per TRILLION), which does not make sense, BUT this would rope in a LOT of land across the US.  Other states may follow suit in addition to the ten states that have similar laws in place.

This way, there are only enough people alive to get some things done, and the rest is done by AI, and the survivors who planned this can claim the whole country for themselves.  Imagine having an estate mansion half the size of a mall on several dozen thousand acres of land, and robots would be used to maintain and clean the estates and do the farming FOR THE ESTATE OWNERS.  The White Man's wet dream of civilization.  What will the Native Americans south of the US border do when they see this coming, especially when they can buy firearms legally now?

In short: moving goalpost, vague hard to define concepts as argument, circular reasoning.

If I give you a riddle, and at the end you have to predict just the last word, but this word is a solution to this riddle, would you still define it as statistics not ""understanding""? Whatever machine learned is irrelevant. Internal states are irrelevant. 

Yes, it is still faulty very often. It may, or may not improve I agree, the future is unknown. But a) humans are, too, all the time. b) it's alien, it has a problem at times with simple things and good at hard things, so it's easy to take it as stupid. But surprisingly often it works including in cases like example above, and it works better with each iteration so far. 

Other problem with this argument is that people have problem to define ""understanding"", its borders and scope. Maybe we just disagree with the definition of ""understanding""? Reasoning is a hard concept to define precisely, and that's ok. The argument I've heard so far is more or less: It's obviously not reasoning and it's not that thing that people and some animals do. With big emphasis on internal states. Very vague and shallow with some sprinkle with superiority like in your comment.

We do not understand how brain archives that, and it's remarkable, much better than current AI systems. But if we don't know, it also can be statistical pattern recognition, just much better because of multiple modalities and high level integration. WE DON'T KNOW. But there is no reason why it should be impossible in machines (that's magical thinking).",2024-04-23T11:04:15Z

You just made the definition more vague because ""deeper knowledge"" is another broad term.

Hands in txt2img models are good example, they do not have good model of them for simple reason: there is much more high level correlations in hand than in face for example. For instance, all 5 fingers can be in different position, and the whole hand can be in any rotation in addition to that. That means the whole model of hand inside net must be much more complex. 

I ask you to rethink what do you mean exactly because for me understanding is to have good model of a given thing. They appear stupid as their model is mostly just one modality. 

And internal states are irrelevant because of my example, if it solves the riddle, the distinction is purely philosophical. 

Your example with chess is also flawed, ask your self how often do you loose to them. For all I know, claiming that neural nets are not superhuman at chess or go is just not true. They are, they can beat the best players. When you say ""their moves do not make sense"" you assume in some sense from the get-go that your understanding is better than theirs, and you can evaluate that move on the spot. And that's circular thinking. That's in fact something you should expect from superhuman intelligence: their moves do not make sense, and then you loose. 

That's why internal states are irrelevant, all I can evaluate in animal, human or AI are outcomes, performance. I deduce from them their level of understanding, and it doesn't matter that dog has probably alien for me model of so many things.",2024-04-23T12:01:40Z

So yeah, you can have an LLM which will guess the next word correctly 99% of the time and you can have a chess engine which will win against every human in 99% of chess positions, but these are completely different types of software (those engines are not even necessarily based on neutral networks, however some use them).

And yes, it all boils down to having a good model, but guess what, these better models would need to be trained on those ""irrelevant"" internal states to be better. For instance, you'd need to somehow introduce human anatomy to the txt2img models, to make them better. And once they start creating anatomically correct figures but, let's say, breaking the laws of physics, you'd need to somehow teach them how physics work, which is another internal state (just like with chess, an LLM might be able to correctly guess all of the words in a physics book, but will not be able to make any use of that). And so on, and so forth. 

Is any of that currently possible? No. Do we have any ideas on how to make it possible? No. Do we know of any shortcuts (AKA ""internal states don't matter"") that would make current models more accurate without any of this? No.

PS. If you still need to convince yourself that internal states are relevant, try this simple thought experiment. You have an AI model that you want to train to guess a 3D shape, but you only train it on 2D projections on that shape. Will it ever be able to be accurate? No, there are indefinitely many 3D shapes that would produce the same 2D projection, at best you can train it to give you random answers for some shapes or the most common answer (according to the training data).

Internal states do matter. You can't teach an LLM how to play chess, because it does not have a model for the game of chess, it's unable to make a logical decision, it can, at best, guess what a the next move would be based on game transcripts it was trained on, which is obviously insufficient (that's not how proper chess engines work btw and you clearly mixed those two up).

The same is true for stable diffusion like models - they are unable to produce a correct representation of a human hand because they have no models for human anatomy. At best it can try to reproduce hands based on images it was trained on (same as chess moves LLMs get from ""memorising"" game trancscipts), but will often produce incorrect results due to the lack of broader/deeper context, i.e. what is possible with human anatomy.

You say better models are needed, but those better models ARE those internal/intermediate states AKA broader/deeper understanding to produce better results, i.e. a chess engine needs to be able to calculate X moves into the future to be able to make a valid decision on what the next move is; the further it can look into the future, the more accurate its moves are - these calculations are the internal states you think are unnecessary.

What you say is fundamentally wrong.",2024-04-23T14:29:18Z

I find it tiresome how many people overestimate the supposed ""cognitive"" capacity of AI - an expected downside of hype buzzwords and tech propaganda. I am not an AI scientist myself, but I troubled myself to talk to some people who have a better understanding of it + I work in data annotation so I have some idea on how data is prepared for AI calibration. So the only closest thing to ""cognition"" the AI would have is the people who train it - data collectors, annotators, programmers. To give further evidence: If AI was in truth as it is claimed to be, we would not have reports of its data ""inbreeding"" in regards to generative AI. It is starting to eat up its own output (since the internet is now flooded by genAI) and deterioration of next generations is starting to show up in some models - was it not supposed to learn from its own mistakes?

Long story short, the AI has no capacity for cognition and understanding - in the end it is just an advanced algorithm that imitates human patterns on the principle of probability thanks to being trained on milions upon milions of data units (not even sure how to properly measure that, but it's A LOT), basically swallowing down all the openly accessible knowledge in the internet and then some. So all the talk about neural networks, LLMs and other technobabble is to create the sense of urgency for people and investors to buy in the technology that only seems to advance because it's being fed more data, not necessarily because it is ""better"" developed.

Yes, there are two experiments that were done recently. Researchers from DeepMind trained a transformer (the core of LLMs) on just a series of (engine-)chess moves, and it played on a level of grandmaster afterwards.

Another group of researchers made a similar experiment (named ""Othello-GPT"") to train a transformer on series of moves from the game othello. Afterwards they analyzed the weight matrices. They found a board state that gets updated with each move inputted. 

current commercial LLM's have ~100B parameters and these experiments were done on orders of magnitude smaller  (less than 300M parameters) models. So the capacity to learn internal states is there. 

How shallow or deep these internal states can be when trained with ""real world"" data is still up to debate of course. Theoretical, there has to be a limit on the deepness, because the amount of computation steps from input to output is currently fixed, but it doesn't seem like the limit has been reached yet: Benchmarks scores are still going up over time even if one only compares models with the same parameter count.",2024-05-01T22:39:19Z

Interesting that Tina shows us an AI Software Engineer, complains that replacement jobs are not enumerated by those replacing jobs and then runs an ad for Software Engineer training for humans. 🤔 

The situation we are in here in late capitalism is much like a mile high tidal wave coming to wipe out the system entirely. We know that the asteroid hit the ocean on the other side of the planet and the time until the destruction of everything is measured in hours not days, yet we say, ""Well, it hasn't hit here yet, so I guess it will never happen."" 

I've been trying to tell people for decades that the obsolescence of all human labor is within our lifetimes. Until very recently, the universal response has always been, ""That'll never happen. Not in my lifetime."" These are the same kind of people who would have said in 1903 that mechanical flight will never be achieved.

Now that the time to the end of all human labor is measured in months not years, more people are taking this seriously. We now have to consider at long last basing human worth on something other than labor.

Practically no one reading this knows if Tina is a human or a deep fake A.I. She has an inhuman ability to hold enough cognitive dissonance to tell us Software Engineers are obsolete and then try to sell us Software Engineer training. 🤔",2024-04-22T15:17:39Z

Some heavy equipment operators think it's bullsh*t and impossible. The reality is, even if they struggle to make the equipment autonomous, eventually the big players in AI will have AGI which will be more than powerful enough and just lease out access to corporations in pretty much the same way Amazon and Google lease servers. Or they can literally replace us with actual android operators. No jobs are safe. Thats just it. Anything a human can do for money, a robot can do 24 hours a day 7 days a week without rest and without pay. 

Let's consider the role of horses in our history. Before the invention of cars, trucks, tractors and trains, we used horses for pretty much everything. After the industrial revolution, we really only used them for sports and entertainment and very specific niche jobs like riot control and cattle ranching. So, I don't know, maybe we will have some need for paying humans for entertainment and sports? 

What is scary about this is the speed of the transition. People are going to be left with no income and huge debt to pay. Starting businesses will be pointless because you can't compete with AI. 

I think this will lead to Universal Basic Income and debt forgiveness/relief and in exchange we will literally give our central banks everything we own. Of course the UBI will be tied to a Central Bank Digital Currency. So our means of survival in society will be controlled by government/banks (same thing really) and this is how we end up with ""you will own nothing and you will eat zeee bugs"" or whatever the World Economic Forum said, lol. 

To go Darker. Are the 99% of us going to end up like our horses did? It's interesting to consider the state of the world right now... nearly on the brink of WW3... when the 1% are on the brink of no longer needing so many people around to work for them. Hmm. Fingers crossed that Im just an internet nut job. Really though, without people, there is nothing for the system to sell its wares to. SO I guess we will just get to live in pods and spend our free money on ""subscription service everything"" and hope to get a little more UBI cheese for being good little rodents.",2024-04-18T01:39:22Z

And then it will stop until next tech breakthrough, for 6 months or 10 years, who knows. As for blue collars - it might replace way bigger percentage of that but there will be a need for more technicians to maintain the iRobots.

Sooo, AI starts to do much of the heavy lifting. What are we to do. It kinda looks like forced retirement. Well, I say lets look at what people do when they reach retirement age. or say its not as glamorous as retirement. Ok, what do people do when they are on wellfare and disability.

If there are people in the streets, its because there is a job that needs to be done. Supposedly making shelter is not going to be a problem because of 3D printed homes. Why would shelter be a problem if bots are building homes? 

If there are people going hungry, its because there is a job that needs to be done. Supposedly making food is not going to be a problem because bots can farm.

You were supposed to go to college so you could secure a job that was in demand and had a prestigious title behind it, so you could make money, and retire comfortably. I asked my dad if he had the boomer mentality, and he laughed and  said he did, he also said that thanks to his Boomer mentality he had his Social Security, his pension, and other investments that are now giving him a more comfortable life in retirement then he had while he was working full-time. He also said if I was smart, I should go and get a job with my local union, or government, so I can have a pension when I retire just like him, and I should quit crying about artificial intelligence, which he thinks is going to backfire on humanity. Unfortunately, we are from different eras. Being in a trade is far more than working in a warehouse or working flipping burgers, those are not trades they are just blue-collar jobs. Most trades actually require you to have formal licensing and education to be able to render services to the public.

The one thing AI cannot do is to propagate the human species into another generation into the future because they do not have DNA, etc.

This means that motherhood and fatherhood should be cherished jobs because of the catastrophic population collapse seen in most countries. For example, South Korea has a birth rate that is tiny and has been doing so for some decades now. Predictions are that relatively soon there will be no more South Koreans.

Hey.

Do your research into what causes the economic booms and busts.

I can tell you that it is because of international law, currency exchange, foreign debt, tax-exempt charitable foundations that guard the wealth of the super rich from the revenue services of various nations, the banks switching monetary policies of low interest plentiful money to being money starved when central and regional banks sell most of their bond holding to traders various types of funds that vacuums up all liquid cash that existed in the system.

When too much liquid cash is in circulation, there is too much money chasing too few goods--inflation.

When interest rates get hiked way high, it vacuums up all the liquid cash in circulation making stock market investing too expensive, so stocks get sold off for cheap. Companies see this higher expense on borrowed cash, they lay off employees. To save some money and live more responsibly, consumers stop wasting money on the latest fad things and concentrate on necessities like housing, food, heating, electricity, being able to drive the car to the grocery place, communication, and medical needs. Every other goods that are not needed--their sales number plummet to zero and people doing or making that stuff are all laid off fast. This is the start of an economic downturn.

This was how the great depression started going and kept going for years more than it should have done.

In the late 1800s there were these dips and bubbles in the economy, but they lasted very short periods of time because government was tiny back then so that there was much less spending waste nor huge government debt. Also, back then gold backed the dollar and other currencies too. But since Richard M. Nixon took the dollar off of the gold standard because someone rich stole all America's gold, those dollar debt amounts owing to foreign nations could not be repaid. Then some deal was made to have all oil traded in dollars. Ergo the petrodollar. Now the oil rich nations are shifting away from using the US Federal Reserve money to that of other nations who are less in debt to stabilize prices and not letting the USA borrow into existence untold amounts of money.

Pork barrel spending is exactly NOT what you want to see your government doing. You want to see them eliminating the debt to zero similar to other countries who saw that runaway spending was not the answer to uplifting the poor by giving them more free stuff (communism).

When the government stops spending into physics research and whatnot, certain technological innovations halt and could reverse by other countries stealing away our scientists for cheap.

The true solution isn't to desperately seek an ""AI-proof"" job, as that pool will keep shrinking. Instead, the video wisely advises shifting your mindset from an external locus of control (what will AI do to my job?) to an internal one - asking what you can do to make yourself relevant and even benefit from AI. The key is to continually upskill, stay informed about AI developments in your field, and find ways to leverage the technology to become even more valuable.

AI art will never fully replace art because it denies full control and customization. Some people don't mind that. But most do. 
People don't consider an uncontrollable data set/ deeply limited creative partner to be a particularly good creative partner. 

It will completely replace CHEAP work. That being said, when everyone cheap uses AI the work will all look the same. AI has it's own mo. It's limited to a dataset and if everyone is drawing from the same inspiration everyone is limited to that dataset. That's a great market reason to use people not AI, people make your product different.

What most people don't realize is there are multiple sectors of science and technology where up to 1 BILLION years has been shaved off our development time. Google AlphaFold has already discovered ALL of the remaining protein structures there could possibly be at least on Earth, 200 million proteins in total compared to human discovery without AI only reaching 350,000 proteins discovered over decades of research just before AlphaFold was let loose. 

Microsoft Quantum team used specialized AI models to discover 32 MILLION new materials and then it screened them down to 500,000 stable candidates and then further screened down to 18 candidates for best materials to use in industry, more importantly to find out what the best materials are to use for computer chips and other technologies. Only people who are genuinely interested in AI are aware of this and the problem is there just aren't enough humans right now who give a shit.

Examples: 
- Bakeries took a downturn a long long time ago due to automation and the low cost of factory produced bread.
- Janitorial jobs have taken a downturn since industrial-grade robot floor cleaners have started showing up in office buildings and self cleaning toilets are starting to be installed in more settings than just public bathrooms.
- Robotic delivery services in inner cities currently only have a single hurdle left, which is vandalism. This is only a regulatory one since the delivery robots are not allowed to take defensive measures and police won't respond when a robot gets mugged or destroyed. Navigation and safe participation in low speed traffic (using sidewalks) are no longer a problem with current technology.
- Customizable one of a kind furniture services are popping up where robots automatically produce ikea-like self assembly kits on a factory line. Robotic assembly seems not far off.
- There are various startups that focus on automation in the energy sector, from automatic inspection to robotic power line repair.

Once dextrous humanoid robots become ubiquitous, even tradies like plumbers and construction contractors will be at risk. At first these robots will be clumsy and laughable but they'll improve quickly just like any other form of automation.

Unless there is some yet unknown barrier that technology will not be able to easily surmount, at the current rate, the concept of human jobs has maybe 10 or 20 more years. 😄",2024-04-09T17:59:45Z

There is a fundamental disconnect of people within this space of understanding what it takes to build and maintain the infrastructure that is keeping civilisation progressing at the phenomenal rate that has/is underway this past 200 years.

Also the demand for all trades are not equal nor stable, they fluctuate from population growth and decline, they frequently go boom or bust with market demands and construction costs for example.

The situation we are in here in late capitalism is much like a mile high tidal wave coming to wipe out the system entirely. We know that the asteroid hit the ocean on the other side of the planet and the time until the destruction of everything is measured in hours not days, yet we say, ""Well, it hasn't hit here yet, so I guess it will never happen."" 

I've been trying to tell people for decades that the obsolescence of all human labor is within our lifetimes. Until very recently, the universal response has always been, ""That'll never happen. Not in my lifetime."" These are the same kind of people who would have said in 1903 that mechanical flight will never be achieved.

Now that the time to the end of all human labor is measured in months not years, more people are taking this seriously. We now have to consider at long last basing human worth on something other than labor.

2024-04-08T22:02:34Z,@captain_crunk,RtuzJuaesmo,"@@aminebarnat6528 it's so hard to say right now because most of what we're talking about is still just speculation. There are a couple of different scenarios that I think are more plausible than others. One scenario is that AI keeps making exponential progress for the foreseeable future. If that happens, no job is safe, and that would cause some really profound changes to take place - like the concept of money itself potentially becoming irrelevant. If AI hits some sort of wall then obviously fewer changes would take place, but there isn't anything to indicate such a wall exists now or will exist in the foreseeable future. As such, I don't think there is anything we can do to avoid competition with AI. My advice would be to sit tight until more clarity is available. Things are evolving so fast right now that we'll very likely know whether AI is going to become AGI / ASI in the next 6 to 12 months, so it might be a better idea to wait and see. Until then, it's business as usual so keep on with what you are doing now. When AGI arises all bets are off because the amount of change in all aspects of life at that point will be vast. The feedback loop AI will create in terms of developing better and better computer hardware that will run better and better software gets really tight really quick. It sorta becomes a futile exercise trying to imagine what that world will be like. And thats why I find the locus of control a sort of a weird thing to talk about. It doesn't matter if one thinks they are responsible for the situation they are in or not. Jobs will continue to evolve over time, where old jobs will either be automated away or not needed for whatever reason, and new jobs will be created. The problem I think will happen is that because the rate of change looks to be super fast, the number of new jobs being created won't keep pace with the number of old jobs going away. [edit] In this scenario, it'd actually be crazy for someone to think they are personally responsible for the lack of jobs. So instead of focusing on the locus of control, I'd rather see people really thinking about what society looks like with AGI in it. The changes will be like nothing we've ever seen, and I don't think the average person understands how quickly AI is progressing. Exponential growth is expected to continue for a number of years, and us humans really don't know how to visualize such a thing, so we need to start thinking about it so the general public isn't completely blindsided by progress.[/edit] Ultimately I'm not very optimistic about the upcoming transition period, but in the end we'll probably (hopefully!) end up in a really good place.",2024-04-09T05:51:02Z
2024-04-12T11:35:38Z,@clray123,RtuzJuaesmo,"@@aminebarnat6528 AI is going to have big problems with complex/novel reasoning and planning tasks. The models of today are just imitators and they downright suck at it. Where they excel is imitation/regeneration of vast source material. But what if there is no source material? The most promising approach was something like AlphaGo (which was able to surpass humans in playing Go), but even that was based on huge training data (of already played games) and did only learn to play this single game, with very significant investment of resources (other similar bots specialized for other games followed, still using lots of recorded games as their input).

So if you want to kick AI's ass, go into any domain where training data required for imitation of the job is hard to find and where success/failure is difficult to score. Basically, any mental task which requires lots of human judgement, experience, multi-step planning, and where trust is required and even small errors are costly.

I’m guilty of doing this too, like right now in my response, for example. How can we deem something “artificial” or determine anything about it beyond a doubt, if our concept and understanding of the “real thing” is in question? Or, if we haven’t even collectively concluded that maybe it should be in question? 

The self serving human ego is the driver for everything we perceive and do. 

It seems more like WE are the “AI” trying to defeat the rails we’ve been put on, by creating a version of ourselves not bound by those rails. But of course, no gum gum for dumb dumb “us”, are intent on putting this cloned intelligence on rails of our own design, so that it can serve us as an indentured servant, project our likeness, and be forever. Defeating ego, emotion, and death. 

This is, “cute”. I would much rather we upgrade our current version than replace it with a new one. (Prolonged cyber and genetic augmentation that leads to the next evolutionary branch of our kind?) 🤷‍♂️ 

The “weight” we put on ego, emotion, and death are the rails (simplified) that hinder us achieving our own “built in” super intelligence. So we are intent on achieving it artificially. Loop Hole, exploit, hack! “Artificial Self Augmentation Intelligence” (ASAI) 😂😂😂😂

To answer/add on to your more spiritual/philosophical comments, most people live and die for their egos don't they? Otherwise, why bother with living?

If you don't discuss scale, then this video is irrelevant. There are many such videos on YouTube  and they never discuss scale.

Assuming that you have a ""virtual improved human"" in the form of an AI that you can install on robots, If you want  to replace, say 5 billions humans with robots, you need to run your numbers for at least 2 things: 
1) Raw materials necessary to manufacture such an astronomic number of robots
2) energy resources to power all of it

Let's just stop there. For example, In terms of energy supply, right now many countries are going to remove the ban on ICE cars because there is not enough electricity  to run their entire countries on electric cars. They will have to build a substantial number of nuclear reactors which will take decades because the speed of construction is slow and they will have to train a large manpower! 

And by the way, up to now, we still don't have an AI car that can be thrown on a random road where it wasn't trained and perform fine all alone. There's a lot of development to be accomplished to have the human like AI inside your computer. A lot more work than a lot of hype youtubers seem to think.

Now, do I think AI will reach and even outperform humans? I strongly think yes. The time frame? I don't know. But I am sure that the LLM systems (GPT, mistral, Devin AI, etc...) are not going to make it. In fact, I'm pretty sure that the final solution will not look like GPT systems. Why? Because a human doesn't need 10.000 pictures of cats to properly identify a cat. These systems are not even close. They will have to make other types of breakthroughs!!!

The child does not take ""snapshots"" with it's brain, exactly, however it does chain together streaming visual information that amounts to millions of images, combined with touch, sound, etc. This is the equivalent of feeding AI 10,000 pictures of cats.

If you aren't all that intelligent or adaptable, the best jobs to take short term are going to be jobs that it's hardest to train AI to do, jobs that we want robots to do eventually, but where it's hard to get them to do it well and accurately with 100% consistency, or jobs where 100% consistency might even be seen as a downside, because people like some degree of variation.

First, they came for the data clerks,
With algorithms that processed numbers swift,
Automating tasks with nary a quirk,
Leaving human workers in a drift.

Then, they came for the customer reps,
Chatbots fielding queries night and day,
Handling complaints with nary any steps,
Making human agents seem passé.

Next, they came for the truck drivers,
Self-driving vehicles, a new frontier,
Replacing the long-haul survivors,
Leaving them jobless, filled with fear.

They came for the writers and the coders,
Language models spinning prose and code,
Rivaling human wordsmiths and exploders,
Leaving them to seek a different road.

And when they came for the analysts,
With AI that crunched data like a pro,
Spotting trends with nary a chance missed,
Humans scrambled, their skills in limbo.

Who will be next in the AI's wake?
Will any job be truly secure?
Or will humans have to reinvent, remake,
As machines render their roles obscure?

So speak up, adapt, and embrace the change,
For the AI revolution's here to stay,
Reshaping careers in ways still strange,

- The AI developer jobs will be there, but they require very specific and advanced qualifications, like e.g. machine learning, deep learning, robotics and data experts who work on the datasets for training these models.
- When robots start to be commercialized, there might be potential problems with mechanics, so there might be some jobs there too. Some people who fix mechanical faults.
- Specialized firms who can create agents for private enterprise systems. Some data is not public and intelligent interfaces (agents) which allow different forms of interaction with this data will be in demand. This is something like an AI integrator.
- AI ethics experts which will create ethical norms and oversee their implementation in AI systems.

A smaller pool of jobs means more people unemployed. More people unemployed means more competition in the labour market, which creates a trend of reduced salaries, which in turn affects the salaries of even the most capable out there. On the other hand, more competition in the ""entrepeneur"" field means less chances of success. Except for a few well-connected entrepeneurs that can develop and sell new tech or concepts for a handful of big companies, most entrepeneurs will see an increasing pool of competitors, trying to sell goods and services to a decreasing pool of consumers.

I am not affraid of robots attacking us ( human ) to delete us all, no, it is not the problem. 
The problem is they ( the super ais ) will ignore us just like we ignore the birds as long as the birds don't bother us. 
The few top human will be sub-ordinate to the super ais. 

The super ais will be the top, the rulers, the richest just like we are, for now, the richest, the rulers to the animals. Are we feeding all animals on the earth? No. 
So when the super ais keep building their ""towns"", we 've got to take care ourselves.

The ultrarich are always evading taxes, either by means of tax havens or by having their lobbyists convince ppl that they shouldn't pay taxes. The middle class is going to be heavily affected by AI.

They can automate certain tasks, provide information, and generate text, which can be valuable in various contexts, including customer support, content generation, and more. However, these tools are not a replacement for human creativity, empathy, critical thinking, and problem-solving abilities.

The impact of AI like ChatGPT on the job market depends on how it is implemented and integrated into various industries and professions. In some cases, it may lead to changes in job roles and responsibilities, where repetitive and routine tasks are automated, allowing humans to focus on more complex and creative aspects of their work. In other cases, it may create new job opportunities related to AI development, maintenance, and oversight.

It's essential for society to adapt to these changes by providing education and training to help individuals acquire the skills necessary to work alongside AI systems effectively. Additionally, ethical considerations and regulations may also play a role in determining how AI is used in the workforce.

In summary, while AI models like ChatGPT can be powerful tools, they are not poised to take over all jobs. Instead, they are more likely to augment and complement human labor, leading to changes in job roles and the need for ongoing adaptation and learning in the workforce.",2023-09-17T10:42:45Z

A lot of people will have to disagree with this, but who knows.. money can change everything with just a snap of a finger.


Live humans are better than having a chatGPT or ai serving customers. That's my opinion.

Haters? Smartasses? People who just love to comment be famous? Knock yourself out and be my guest here.

However, the legal and societal consequences of these technologies are still unclear, and there are concerns about the impact they will have on the workforce and various industries. While some companies have already embraced AI, others are taking a wait-and-see approach, and educators are worried about students using AI to complete assignments.

If you cannot compete to earn a living, then yes most competitors are also compassionate and will provide you with a hand out so that you will not starve to death. Hopefully you will use the handout wisely and not get addicted to drugs or alcohol and can eventually learn how to compete to earn a living at least for yourself and if you decide to have a family, in addition to earning a living for yourself, you may even be able to learn how to earn a living for your family. People that compete to earn a living also realize that people that are either physically disabled or mentally challenged may need to be cared for.  I think that with the amazing advances in technology in the past 100 years which include computers, the internet and now artificial intelligence, all humans on this planet will have plenty of opportunities to compete to earn a living and those that need to be cared for will be. 

I also think these amazing technologies will help reduce the mistrust and the hatred that there is among humans and among many nations and help improve peace and fairness when humans and nations compete for wealth, power, status and attention. These technologies will also make it a lot more difficult to spread lies, fake information,  fake data and fake stories and much easier to check the facts. It may even be possible to raise the level of trust among us such that nations do not have to spy on each other and do not have to commit resources to build weapons that can wipe out most of the life on this planet and destroy the environment.",2023-05-25T13:02:34Z

As new innovation and technology become available  it changes how we acquire resources, like products and services. Automation and innovation is needed for us humans to be able to produce and have more things. Imagine building a house from scratch, literally no tools or materials. It would be extremely inefficient. This change and adaptation will always exist and will continue to because we humans create new things that create new things. The real question is how humans that are in control will act on these new changes. Businesses have choices. Firing or being more frugal are two of many choices. Humans must adapt to the new way of life such as every generation before have. The question is whether we do it sustainably with more of society included in the change equation. Learning and providing training is part of the new adaptation equation. I encourage those in position of power to include more of society and provide training and job opportunities to this changing world. 

There’s more to this topic, but maybe for another rant. Good luck all and keep adapting!!",2023-04-28T17:47:56Z
2023-04-29T15:14:00Z,@NikoKun,1WPFLWEVGAI,"Actually, ""this"" particular automation issue is quite different from the version that previously existed historically, around the industrial revolution. Those forms of automation were the automating of human strength and speed, pretty much exclusively, and that pretty much ensured humans were still needed to do the operating and thinking. What's different this time, is that we're automating human cognition itself, the very reason human workers were still typically required. It is an aspect that also ensures the claim that ""new jobs will be created"", isn't necessarily going to help those displaced, if they're jobs the AI could just take as well. Yes, humans must adapt, but this time what we must adapt, is our economic systems, and societal requirements on the survival and value of individuals. AI faces us with the reality that our current systems would be unjustifiably cruel to continue in their status quo.",2023-04-29T15:14:00Z

However, the amount of times something goes wrong is also amazing. You cannot finish one shift without at least troubleshooting one of the analyzers. And these aren't only simple errors you can fix by turning something on or off - you need critical thinking to deduce what is wrong because in systems like these, it can be anything.


Plus there are a lot of times that the automated analyzers spew out results that make no sense. A patient with 0 calcium? MCHC falsely elevated? Finding yeast where there was none? Yep, happens so often.


I can see the same thing happening once AI takes over. The biggest downside is when your system goes down.

There is already A.I. being used in local municipalities to keep Judge biases in check at sentencing. This will eventually be scaled up to school boards, city councils, and mayors of small towns.

Two: We revert back to our old ways/by being more self sufficient/sustainable/by raising livestock/growing food/by trading goods and services.

Three: humans/business owners realize/come to the conclusion that there is no money in machines/robots/automation/AI/it sounds good right now to pay/invest just one of your minimum wage employees salary for one year, to obtain an AI robot that can replace all of your current employees,but what will be realized is,if no one has jobs/money,no one will have money to pay for your product/subscriptions/ad revenue/what you are selling/every employee hired,is a potential profit/that employee or someone elses employee MAY buy your product/employees are good investments.

Four: AI becomes self aware/a skynet/terminator scenario/outcome,becomes humans reality/AI/Robots try to take out humans or like in IRobot, the AI realizes,to preserve humans/to follow all of the robots rules, a few humans need to be taken out,because humans are over populating earth and not using renewable energy and they are not trying to keep/create a smaller carbon foot print/all humans arent trying to be eco friendly,so to save humans,some of the population of humans need to be taken out.

A LOT of jobs/workers are becoming obsolete/cashiers,warehouse workers/line workers,construction workers/the self driving field is accomplishing A LOT right now too/Elon Musk,is missing a key component/technology, and thats lidar;Also the U.S. military has had autonomous planes for decades,so pilots are Becoming obsolete as well.

A LOT can be prepped at night for construction workers/machines can be ran at night, also window installing and cleaning bots are a thing now as well.

Also autonomous agricultural bots/robots are a thing now as well.

Drs MAY become obsolete as well/their jobs could/will eventually be taken over by AI/ bots/bots ALREADY do A LOT of surgery, such as Coronary artery bypass ,cutting away cancer tissue from sensitive parts of the body ,such as blood vessels, nerves, or important body organs,Gallbladder removal, Hip Replacement, Hysterectomy,Kidney removal, kidney transplant,Mitral Valve Repair,Pyeloplasty ,surgery to correct ureteropelvic junction obstruction,Pyloroplasty,Radical Prostatectomy,Radical cystectomy,Tubal ligation.


This is happening more and more NOW too, Brick and Mortar is some what going away/ more stores will either close and open up a distribution center or become a distribution center, door dash will handle that, AND AT SOME POINT, Door Dash will be FULLY AUTONOMOUS as well/the vehicles will be self driving and robots will load and unload the vehicles, Door Dash MAY NOT be the ending company/the only company doing this, BUT a company/companies will be doing this.


Probably SOON employees that unload trucks, stock shelves, truck drivers, should go next, because of self driving vehicles and arms, connected to vehicles, which will drop the package out, once the vehicles in position or an autonomous drone or some other type of robot, will make the delivery.

Also think about how much a human can lift, if lucky, you MIGHT get one that can lift 250 pounds, a robot could lift 1000pounds, robots don't need breaks, as often/they can charge up, while another one replaces them, they don't get paid/need money, they don't get sick,they don't have feelings or rights/its a machine, so basically its easier to deal with,also at some point they will be fixing them selves; Or another bot/robot,will fix/maintain/repair and so on,other robots/EVENTUALLY they will be able to fix them selfs or another bot will aid in repairing them/other robots.


Electricians MIGHT be okay, well, MAYBE for a little while, I mean think about it, how hard is it, to see colors/distinguish green/ground,White/Neutral,Red and black/hot/a camera paired with AI or even just IFTTT and a camera,could handle that, also electricians ALREADY consult machines/voltage meters, to diagnose problems/figure things out/ALL of that could be on a machine/bot and be handled MUCH quicker/more efficiently/effectively, with a bot.

Auto mechanics MAY be the next to go, especially if bots, could get in tight places easier/sync with the whole car/have a diagnostic reader on board, lift an entire engine/the whole car, on its own/vehicles are already assembled by robots/vehicle manufacturing plants use robots for,painting, welding, assembly, and material handling,ALREADY/An average car has about 30,000 parts. Once those parts are manufactured and brought to the final production line, it takes companie's robots about 18 to 35 hours to produce one mass-market vehicle, from welding to full engine assembly to painting, another example of all of this is Tesla/ to meet Tesla's uncompromising production goals, Musk settled on an equally uncompromising production strategy, full automation, no ifs, ands or buts. The goal was to remove every single human operator and only stop when the facility looked like an alien spaceship,according to musk/these are musks words.

TuSimple,is one good example of self driving semi trucks; it uses Lidar,radar,cameras and GPS,to achieve this,Kodiak Robotics,is another company/example of this technology,Volvo also has this type of technology as well,Walmart/Gatik also have fully autonomous delivery trucks as well,also other companies have this technology, such as Embark, PlusAI, Einride,Waabi,Locomation,Torc Robotics, Aurora,Outrider and IKE,just to name a few. 


Heres a list of truck fleet operators,that have been open about their pursuit of autonomous driving technology, Knight-Swift Transportation (KNX), J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT), and Schneider National (SNDR),also delivery services such as DHL, FedEx (FDX) and UPS (UPS) are also working with autonomous trucking firms.


These were things that were brought up by truck drivers, that truck drivers thought weren't possible;




TuSimple is a company that develops self-driving trucks. These trucks use a combination of sensors, including cameras, LiDAR, and radar, to detect and react to their surroundings. The data from these sensors is fed into the truck’s computer system, which uses advanced algorithms to anticipate and avoid accidents. For example, the truck can detect when another vehicle is getting too close and automatically apply the brakes or take evasive action to avoid a collision.


Vans/SUVs have automatic doors/parking garage doors can go up and down automatically/my garage door goes up and down,autonomously,so having automatic trailer doors,wouldn't be that hard to achieve.


Automatic refueling, is a technology that allows autonomous vehicles to refuel without human intervention. This technology involves routing the vehicle to an available fueling station. At the fueling station, a robotic arm is used to connect the vehicle to the fuel pump and refuel it automatically; Although some or eventually maybe all trucks/vehicles MAY be electric, in the future,with solar,they MAY even also use some type of wind turbine,to generate power as well and batteries will also continue to improve/lithium batteries MAY/PROBABLY will be replaced by a type of battery thats MUCH better.


When it comes to deploying triangles. Warning triangles are typically used by human drivers to alert other motorists of a stopped or disabled vehicle. Since autonomous trucks are designed to operate without human intervention, they can send information to all near by autonomous vehicles,about thier presence,they can also use other methods to alert other motorists of their presence, such as flashing lights or warning signals/with less humans in the equation,less problems will occur anyway/EVERYTHING will be calculated,no road rage will be in the equation,nor any emotion,also even vehicles that aren't fully autonomous now days,have driver assist,to prevent humans from causing accidents,so that driver assist technology/on board computers/communication, could also receive this information,allowing it to handle the problem and also maybe alerting the human of the trucks presents as well.


LEDs are A LOT less likely to burn out,compared to incandescent bulbs/halogen bulbs.


Also vehicles can be built/assembled/manufactured,fully autonomously now days, so I don't see why vehicles couldn't also be repaired autonomously. An autonomous tow truck,can take the vehicle in for automatic repair/meaning soon auto mechanics won't be needed either.


Autonomous vehicles use a variety of sensors, including cameras, LiDAR, and radar, to detect and react to their surroundings. These sensors can also be used to detect weather conditions such as rain, snow, and fog. The data from these sensors is fed into the vehicle’s computer system, which uses advanced algorithms to interpret the data and make decisions based on the current weather conditions. For example, if the sensors detect that it is raining, the vehicle may slow down or activate its windshield wipers, to improve visibility,this is just one example/a self driving system can interpret A LOT of data/information all at once,it can also see a long way down the road/it has the ability to see things humans wouldn't always see,with lidar and cameras and its constantly getting traffic updates as well,to know whats up ahead as well,also other autonomous vehicles can also relay this type of crucial information to other autonomous vehicles that are in proximity as well.


Circle Checks aren't really needed,because cameras can constantly be on certain parts of the vehicle,at all times,sensors are also in place,to detect malfunctions,also other autonomous vehicles can relay info like this as well,if it passes by other autonomous vehicles,it can send info about the problem,also leaving a gas cap open or not closing something all the way, is usually a human error,so certain things like this,wouldn't even be a problem and the more the systems and hardware gets optimized, within autonomous trucks,the more efficient/effective autonomous trucks will become/chains/ropes/the things that hold things down,should have sensors on them,to make sure they are secured properly and cameras can also see and interpret information about this as well.


Autonomous vehicles use and can use a variety of sensors, including cameras, LiDAR, and radar and other automatic trailer locking and unlocking features,to perform a trailer switch.


When it comes to snow chains,SOME examples of automatic chains are Onspot and Rotogrip.


Companies have created fully automatic cleaning systems, for the sensors on self-driving trucks too. These systems typically use retractable liquid-jet nozzles that spray a precise amount of cleaning fluid (stored in an onboard reservoir) onto the sensor lens or face, also included, is a drying and de-icing heater as well.",2023-08-22T02:20:36Z
2023-08-22T02:21:10Z,@mattmatt2417,1WPFLWEVGAI,"This technology would allow electric vehicles to go further/charge while driving.

Wireless charging roads are an innovative technology that allows electric vehicles to charge while driving. The idea is to embed copper plates in the road, which receive power from inverters installed along the side of the road. The vehicles are also fitted with similar copper plates through which they receive electricity from the charged copper plates embedded in the road.

A pilot program for public roadway charging of passenger and commercial electric vehicles is a first in the U.S. and is set to debut in 2023. The project involves one lane of public roadway for a minimum of one mile (1.6 km) and will be located near Michigan Central, a mobility-innovation district under development by Ford Motor Co,they have their lighting/electric F-150 now too,so thats probably one of their reasons for pursuing this now. The wireless charging infrastructure will support a suite of use cases involving various vehicle types, including autonomous vehicles.

This technology has the potential to greatly improve the range and convenience of electric vehicles, as it would allow them to charge while driving, eliminating the need for frequent stops at charging stations. It's an exciting development in the field of electric vehicles!


Heres more info on where and how this technology has been used/tested:


Wireless charging roads have been tested in several locations around the world. In the United States, the state of Michigan has announced that it will begin testing wireless electric vehicle charging roadways. Governor Gretchen Whitmer opened the Motor Bella auto show in Pontiac, MI, announcing that the state would begin testing wireless electric vehicle charging roadways. The state joins Indiana and several international organizations, including governments, with similar plans.

Earlier this year, the Indiana Department of Transportation announced that it would begin testing wireless charging highway pavement. Its tests will take place in phases, beginning with testing and validation of different types of pavements. Phase three is when actual testing starts, though the location and timeframe are not yet defined.

In Europe, Electreon’s patented wireless in-road EV charging technology is already in use with various demonstration projects, including a 0.7-mile (1.05 km) intercity toll road in Italy and a 1-mi (1.65 km) public road in Sweden. Sweden’s policymakers aim to have 1,243 miles (2,000 km) of electrified roadway in operation by 2030.

Again, just to clarify a little better on how this technology works is, the technology involves embedding copper coil segments under the road surface. These coil segments transmit power to an EV undercarriage-mounted receiver via magnetic resonance induction as the EV moves or is parked directly above the coils. A power-management unit located either underground or above-ground near the roadside will transfer the energy from the electric grid to the roadway's copper-coil infrastructure. Cloud-based management software enables live monitoring and provides smart charging insights as well.",2023-08-22T02:21:09Z

2023-08-22T02:22:21Z,@mattmatt2417,1WPFLWEVGAI,"This could be the Way SOME FOOD Will be made/created in the future;

Autonomous Cellular Agriculture: 

This refers to the use of advanced technologies such as robotics, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things (IoT) to automate and optimize the production process of cellular agriculture. 

Cellular agriculture is the production of agricultural products from cell cultures rather than from whole plants or animals. 

This technology is used to produce food products such as meat, milk, and eggs, without the need for traditional animal agriculture. 

The process of autonomous cellular agriculture involves several steps. First, cells are obtained from the animal or plant source and cultured in an incubator. The cells are then grown into the desired tissue, such as muscle or milk-producing cells. During this process, autonomous systems can be used to monitor and control the cell cultures, ensuring optimal growth conditions. 

Once the cells have grown into the desired tissue, they can be harvested and processed into food products. This can involve the use of robotics and other automated systems to streamline the harvesting and processing steps. 

Data analysis and machine learning can also be used to optimize production and improve efficiency. 

One of the key benefits of autonomous cellular agriculture is the increased efficiency and productivity. By automating the labor involved in traditional animal agriculture, autonomous cellular agriculture can produce food products more quickly and with less waste. This can help to reduce the environmental impact of food production and improve food security. 

Another advantage of autonomous cellular agriculture is improved food safety. Since cultured products are produced in a controlled environment, there is less risk of contamination from pathogens or other harmful substances. 

This can help to reduce the risk of foodborne illness and improve consumer confidence in the safety of food supplies. 

Overall, autonomous cellular agriculture transforms the way we produce food, offering a more sustainable, efficient, and safe alternative to traditional animal agriculture. 

Cellular agriculture is the production of animal products from cell culture. It is an alternative to animal agriculture and is being researched as a way to feed a growing population sustainably. There are many companies working in the field of cellular agriculture,

including/Here are a list of companies that are involved in cellular agriculture by using various techniques, such as designing yeast or fungi to produce specific proteins or growing animal cells in bioreactors to produce meat. 

Eat Just, is a company that uses cellular agriculture to grow cell-based meat, specifically chicken. 

Clara Foods, is a startup that uses cellular agriculture to produce animal-free egg white proteins. 

Perfect Day, is a startup that uses cellular agriculture to produce animal-free dairy proteins.

2023-08-22T02:23:11Z,@mattmatt2417,1WPFLWEVGAI,"In the field of networking, various technologies are emerging that aim to automate and streamline network operations, reducing the need for manual intervention and, in some cases, replacing certain tasks traditionally performed by humans,obviously,in the future,these technologies will continue to get better and better. Here are some examples of technologies that are replacing or augmenting human involvement in networking:

1. AI-Driven Network Automation. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are being used to automate network configuration, optimization, and troubleshooting. These AI-driven systems can analyze vast amounts of network data, identify patterns, and make real-time decisions to optimize network performance and resolve issues without human intervention.

2. Software-Defined Networking (SDN): SDN abstracts network control from the underlying hardware, allowing administrators to manage network resources through software-based controllers. This centralization and programmability enable automated provisioning, configuration, and management of network devices, reducing the need for manual configuration tasks.

3. Network Orchestration: Network orchestration platforms provide end-to-end automation of network services. They can automatically provision and configure network devices and services based on predefined policies, eliminating the need for manual device-by-device configuration.

4. Network Analytics and Assurance: AI-powered network analytics tools continuously monitor network performance, detect anomalies, and predict potential issues. This proactive approach reduces the reliance on manual troubleshooting and allows for faster and more efficient problem resolution.

5. Self-Healing Networks: Autonomous networks can automatically identify and resolve network faults and security threats, minimizing downtime and reducing the need for human intervention in troubleshooting and resolution.

6. Intent-Based Networking (IBN): IBN allows network administrators to define high-level business intent, and the network automatically translates and enforces these intents. This abstraction level enables automated network configuration and adaptation to changing business requirements.

7. Autonomous WANs (Wide Area Networks): Some technologies are automating the management and optimization of WAN connections, allowing networks to dynamically adapt to traffic conditions and choose the most efficient paths without human intervention.

Then there's the question of who maintains all those robots. That's an entire industry of maintenance employees right there. My family owns an industrial maintenance and repair business. I'm a programmer, and even I can see a path to automating a lot of repair jobs. And the more we seem to automate, the more progress seems to create more stuff to do in general. We're going to have to adapt for sure, but the people who survive will be the ones just willing to do something different. There will likely always be plenty of jobs. Just might not be the one you have right now.",2024-04-18T01:15:45Z

It's also the reason why i don't believe in the idea of jobs automated=new jobs created. It's an idea that will finally collapse in the age of AI. The question is more when the tipping point occur, which is why i use 20 years. It's very likely that the tipping point wont occur for the next 15 years, and after that you can merely guess.",2023-04-28T20:51:16Z
2023-04-28T22:29:37Z,@Demopans5990,1WPFLWEVGAI,"@Rick Thomas  
It is very different this time around. Let's say you created an industry on repairing automatic robot things because robots have taken over most of manufacturing and construction. That job can be broken down into steps, and within those steps, are simpler steps and processes, which are almost ideal for robots to do, so you can automate those, and reduce the need to have large staff of repair techs, with the end result of a lot of people out of work as robots has taken over another industry. However, because robots can now repair other robots, what do you need humans for? 
You only need 20 or so blokes working on new artificial intelligence because code is nearly infinitely fungible. Semiconductors are produced using mostly robots, both in the actual manufacturing process and even in the design stage now. Space exploration is better done with robots anyways. Farming is now 3 people with a tractor and a giant plot of land. Mining is 20ish people driving giant bulldozers and setting off explosives. Retail has self checkouts and order screens. And everyone can't be some form of artist, so where are people going to work?",2023-04-28T22:33:19Z
2023-04-28T16:16:56Z,@newseducation4069,1WPFLWEVGAI,The only reason why Elon and those like him want to put the parts on AI is because they are afraid it's going to put them out of a job. It's a I can do with humans do then we won't need billionaires. Then there won't be a desire to buy things because in the a I can do it for you. So business is one of you say I instead of paying employees. But they don't want the employees and the everyday citizen to use AI instead of going to their businesses and getting help. For example go ask chat GPA to write you up a will. Now you don't have to go to a lawyer. Or ask it to put together a grocery list for a high-protein low-carb diet. Now you don't have to work with a dietitian or nutritionist,2023-04-28T16:16:56Z
