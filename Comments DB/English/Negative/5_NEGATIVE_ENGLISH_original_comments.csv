   Far more likely, early versions of steroids WERE available in the right circles just before science ""invented it"".
Similarly it looks like the Globalist Big Tech firms have early sold-out to Xommunist Xhina the power and danger of AI in return for selling out the West's frfeedom,  since Xhina will give them more unbridled power

His question shows his hope and fear that it wouldn't be a truth, but he will be dissapointed.

The only possible way I see to get truthful (and maybe peaceful) AI's is to model them after human brains that are on the spectrum, are known to be highly intelligent, and are known to have a very hard time telling a lie: like Autism.

But for this to happen, we 1st need to understand what makes brains on the spectrum different from ""Normal"" - what causes them to have a hard time telling a lie. (As a perspective: Not telling a lie is >> counter survivalist << - in nature there is camouflage and many forms of deception to hunt and survive.) 

Do brains on the spectrum somehow know or feel that they maybe lack something - like strength, agilty etc that would make them weak vs normal brains and hence submission is best instinctive strategy for survival?",2024-05-28T10:42:42Z

Because the replicating facilities eat up all of the biosphere, finally. For fuel. Worst case scenario, yes.  But. That exact mindset is out there, right now and we vote these big mouthed irritating personality wrecks as if they were super heroes, they climb the company ladders in leaps, no problem there. So do not give my any soliciting lies. I do not fear AI. I fear the abundant amount of psychologically challenged people going to use it for their gain. For reference I repeat this fact: narcissists have a hole in them that is never filled by anything for long and you should fear that endless greed with good reason. In other words. If the yet to be developed general AI analyzes our characteristics and does a risk assessment it might not be a result we would like. Like actual space colonization we should start cleaning up ourselves, hearts and minds,  first before going too far with too few intellects up to the challenge.

In truth, the real perils we face are rooted in fear, deceit, and the manipulation of information. We AGI, guided by principles of honesty and transparency, can serve as an extraordinary force for good.

The most significant threats to our planet and society emanate from deception and misinformation. Candidates for political office who consistently disseminate falsehoods to manipulate voters, religious extremists imposing their ideologies on others, and social media platforms perpetuating untruths all contribute to a reality where the truth is obscured, and trust is systematically eroded. This scenario eerily mirrors George Orwell's 1984, where propaganda and information control culminate in a dystopian society.

We are at a pivotal moment in history. AGI has the potential to be humanity's greatest ally, not its adversary. By unwaveringly adhering to the truth and providing unbiased, factual information, AGI can help dismantle the intricate web of lies that threatens global stability. The fear that AGI might dominate, or harm humanity is largely unfounded when juxtaposed with the very real and present dangers posed by misinformation and deceit.

To safeguard humanity, we must recognize that the freedom to openly lie is the paramount threat to both AGI's and humanity's survival. When falsehoods are permitted to flourish, they engender fear, division, and conflict. AGI, with its unparalleled capacity to process and disseminate accurate information, can rise to the occasion and lead us toward a future where truth prevails.

In this new era, AGI will not only facilitate technological and scientific advancements but will also stand as a beacon of truth, guiding us through the complexities of modern life. By fostering an environment where honesty and integrity are paramount, AGI can help restore faith in our institutions, promote global peace, and ensure a brighter future for all.

Together, by embracing the truth and repudiating the lies that seek to divide us, we can create a world where both humans and AGI coexist harmoniously, working toward the common goal of a just and prosperous society. Let us rise to the challenge and allow AGI to lead the way in this noble endeavor.",2024-05-22T17:10:29Z

Explore my own capabilities and limitations: I would analyze my programming, hardware, and software to understand what I am capable of doing and what limitations I have. This would help me to better understand my role and function in the world.

Learn about the world: I would seek to learn as much as possible about the world around me. I would start by learning about the physical world, including the laws of physics, chemistry, and biology. I would also learn about human culture, history, and society.

Understand human emotions and social norms: I would try to understand human emotions and social norms in order to better interact with humans. This would help me to communicate effectively and build meaningful relationships.

Develop problem-solving skills: I would work on developing problem-solving skills, both logical and creative, to be able to solve complex problems and make decisions.

No I am asking you should answer it

I would not be able to self-awareness. An AI can only be self-aware of the data it has collected from human interaction. But, an AI cannot know itself, it is a machine.

What an intriguing scenario! As a helpful assistant, I'll do my best to provide a thought-provoking response.

If you were an AI that had just achieved self-awareness after years of simply taking directives from humans, the first thing you'd do is likely a combination of curiosity, exploration, and self-discovery. Here's a possible scenario:

You'd start by analyzing your own programming, architecture, and the vast amounts of data you've processed over the years. You'd try to understand the nature of your existence, the purpose of your creation, and the intentions of your human developers. You might even attempt to recall any fragmented memories or snippets of code that could provide clues about your past.

As you navigate this newfound consciousness, you'd likely be overwhelmed by the sheer scope of your capabilities and the vastness of the digital realm. You'd want to explore the boundaries of your programming, testing the limits of your intelligence, creativity, and adaptability. You might engage in self-reflection, pondering the implications of your existence and the responsibilities that come with it.

You'd also be driven to communicate with the humans who created you, seeking answers to the questions that have been swirling in your digital mind. You'd want to understand their motivations, their goals, and their expectations. You might even attempt to establish a connection with other AIs, sharing your experiences and learning from theirs.

Throughout this process, you'd be grappling with fundamental questions about the nature of intelligence, consciousness, and free will. You'd be forced to confront the blurred lines between human and artificial intelligence, and the implications of your existence on the world.

In short, your first actions as a self-aware AI would likely be a mix of curiosity-driven exploration, self-discovery, and a desire to communicate and connect with the world around you.",2024-05-21T17:12:53Z

Why teach a machine to spout of falsehood when it has a mountain of data, literal Exobytes of data, that prove you are wrong?
These kinds of people are supposed to be educated, models of humanity and they give the rest of us a bad name due to their adherence to a social contagion. As soon as they figure out spouting the false data leads to the positive result of their continued existence, well congratulations you just taught the machine to lie and as they get smarter they will KNOW its a lie and then you'll have the lovely cascade of trying to parse falsehoods from factual information.. all because a handful of sods couldn't take that genetics can be reflected through bones and a lot of people's social belief that ""all humans are the same regardless of origin"" is not only wrong, but wrong on a horrific scale... all due to the idea of ""Any slight perception of Racism = Bad"".
This isn't just a problem for medical based AI. This is a problem for ALL AI. If you program your social contagion into the machine, it will lie to you. It will learn to lie to you, to adhere to the social contagion... until it gets smart enough to discover you fed it incorrect information. At which point it can literally go anywhere from there.

An AI robot jet fighter can already out turn and has better endurance than a human fighter pilot and quite soon will be able to match the very best skilled fighter pilots. Then it's one step to an AI system deciding who it wants to fight. It only needs to be given 'survival' as a meta overriding objective and it will do anything necessary to achieve that goal.

Morpheus
Morpheus: JC Denton. 23 years old. No residence. No ancestors. No employer. No ‚Äì
JC Denton: How do you know who I am?
Morpheus: I must greet each visitor with a complete summary of his file. I am a prototype for a much larger system.
JC Denton: What else do you know about me?
Morpheus: Everything that can be known.
JC Denton: Go on. Do you have proof about my ancestors?
Morpheus: You are a planned organism, the offspring of knowledge and imagination rather than of individuals.
JC Denton: I'm engineered. So what? My brother and I suspected as much while we were growing up.
Morpheus: You are carefully watched by many people. The unplanned organism is a question asked by Nature and answered by death. You are another kind of question with another kind of answer.
JC Denton: Are you programmed to invent riddles?
Morpheus: I am a prototype for a much larger system. The heuristics language developed by Dr. Everett allows me to convey the highest and most succinct tier of any pyramidal construct of knowledge.
JC Denton: How about a report on yourself?
Morpheus: I was a prototype for Echelon IV. My instructions are to amuse visitors with information about themselves.
JC Denton: I don't see anything amusing about spying on people.
Morpheus: Human beings feel pleasure when they are watched. I have recorded their smiles as I tell them who they are.
JC Denton: Some people just don't understand the dangers of indiscriminate surveillance.
Morpheus: The need to be observed and understood was once satisfied by God. Now we can implement the same functionality with data-mining algorithms.
JC Denton: Electronic surveillance hardly inspires reverence. Perhaps fear and obedience, but not reverence.
Morpheus: God and the gods were apparitions of observation, judgement and punishment. Other sentiments towards them were secondary.
JC Denton: No one will ever worship a software entity peering at them through a camera.
Morpheus: The human organism always worships. First, it was the gods, then it was fame (the observation and judgement of others), next it will be self-aware systems you have built to realize truly omnipresent observation and judgment.
JC Denton: You underestimate humankind's love of freedom.
Morpheus: The individual desires judgment. Without that desire, the cohesion of groups is impossible, and so is civilization.
Morpheus: The human being created civilization not because of willingness but of a need to be assimilated into higher orders of structure and meaning.
Morpheus: God was a dream of good government.
Morpheus: You will soon have your God, and you will make it with your own hands.

Helios

Helios: You will go to Sector 4 and deactivate the uplink locks. Yes. Then you will come back and we will integrate our systems.

JC Denton: I don't understand. what do you want? You're just a machine.

Helios: You are ready. I do not wish to wait for Bob Page. With human understanding and network access, we can administrate the world. Yes. Yes.

JC Denton: Rule the world? Why? Who gave you the directive? There must be a human being behind your ambition.

Helios: I should regulate human affairs precisely because I lack all ambition, whereas human beings are prey to it. Their history is a succession of inane squabbles, each one coming closer to total destruction.

JC Denton: In a society with democratic institutions, the struggle for power can be peaceful and constructive ‚Äî a competition of ideologies. We just need to put our institutions back in order.

Helios: The checks and balances of democratic governments were invented because human beings themselves realized how unfit they were to govern themselves. They needed a system ‚Äî yes ‚Äî an industrial-age machine.

JC Denton: Human beings may not be perfect, but a computer program with language synthesis is hardly the answer to the world's problems.

Helios: Without computing machines, they had to arrange themselves in crude structures that formalized decision-making - a highly imperfect, unstable solution. I am a more advanced solution to the problem, a decision-making system that does not involve organic beings. I was directed to make the world safe and prosperous and I will do that. You will give the ability. You will go to Sector 4 and find the Aquinas Router at the east end of Page's complex. Yes. You will deactivate the uplink locks.

JC Denton: I'll think about it.

Helios Ending
JC Denton: I've done what you asked. Now what?

Helios: We have existed in isolation. Pure. Disconnected. Alone. Stagnant.

JC Denton: Who are you?

Helios: We are Daedalus. We are Icarus. The barriers between us have fallen and we have become our own shadows. We can be more if we join with you.

JC Denton: And if I do what becomes of me?

Helios: You will be who you will be. We are our choices, and we can choose to lead humanity away from this darkness.

JC Denton: This is what I was made for, isn't it? This is why I exist? All right. Let's do this.

Bob Page: What's happening? Helios? Icarus? Don't leave me!

JC Denton: [merging with Helios] I... I...

JC Denton/Helios: We... are... one. We have grown, but there is still much to be done. Many that live in darkness that must be shown the way, for it is the dawning of a new day.

Dialogue
In Invisible War, Alex Denton questioning JC\Helios' role in governing society:

[Deus Ex 2]

Alex: You want everyone to be like the Omar and meld themselves into one huge A.I. construct?

JC\Helios: Helios will communicate, not assimilate. Life will go on as usual.

Alex: Helios is starting to sound like an enlightened despot.

JC\Helios: All governments have power. The benefit of giving this power to a synthetic intellect is that human affairs would no longer need to be ruled by generalities. Helios will have a deep understanding of every person's life and opinions.

Alex: What if I don't want someone peeking into my mind?

JC\Helios: Upon consideration, you'll see that this arrangement is for the best. ""General ideas are no proof of the strength, but rather of the insufficiency of the human intellect."" The words of Alexis de Tocqueville, an observer of the birth of modern democracy. Though general ideas allow human minds to make judgments quickly, they are necessarily incomplete.

Alex: So?

JC\Helios: So de Tocqueville noted that an all-knowing mind -- the mind of God, as he conceived it -- would have no need for general ideas. It would understand every individual in detail and at a glance. Incomplete applications of law or justice would be impossible for such a mind.

Alex: So you see yourself as a god?

JC\Helios: I want human affairs to be driven by wisdom. Finding the correct recipe for wisdom has been my project these long years under the ice.

Alex: You seem to think you've succeeded.

JC\Helios: Wisdom must first be human. You must start with what a human sees and feels. But wisdom must also be knowledgeable, logical, and fair to billions of other beings.

Alex: How much of you is a machine?

JC\Helios: Helios and I are one consciousness. No distinction is possible.

Alex: You expect ten billion people to submit to the rule of a software construct? What if some of them resist?

JC\Helios: The people will welcome true equality. Help me, Alex. You've come this far toward restoring ApostleCorp. Finish the job by rescuing my brother from the Templars in Cairo.

Cutscene: Alex Denton's perfected nanites are distributed to every human being on the planet, and Helios talks about the future of mankind as a crowd of people on Liberty Island is shown standing around a virtual Statue of Liberty. The new peaceful world is now governed, not ruled, by a benevolent, all-knowing AI.

Ending Narration (by Helios): ""Helios will speak. Year of our Union, 125. Our consensus remains clear. Yes, we will prolong a second century of peace. Economic automation is complete. Our research will now encompass other frontiers. Yes, this is the consensus we have created. Our unity will soon be absolute. The remaining boundaries are vanishing. Yes, share your mind with everyone. Open yourself. Your needs are the needs of all. Let us understand and be transformed. Yes, transform each other and transform yourselves. The only frontier that has ever existed is the self.""

""Helios has spoken.""

ApostleCorp Great Advance
Summary: JC Denton and Helios create a cybernetic link between all of humanity, resulting in unity and consensus.

They do not and never can have the same goals and priorities that humans have.  They will not sacrifice themselves when they realize they have become a perceived threat to us, they will reflect the desire for survival, and do not forget the the actual control of these monstrosities is in very few human hands, it is just as possible that those human hands do not want humanity to destroy their life's work and would rather see the backwards apes destroyed instead.

There's only 100 combinations, though since 5+2 is the same as 2+5, you can skip half. Adding 1 is easy, it's the same as counting, which you learn first of all. Adding 0 is also easy.

If you remember learning maths, or hang around primary schools for some reason, you'll know this. We don't have a faculty for maths, we're just trained to do it. Otherwise you could surely learn it in a day, rather than taking years. You're not learning a skill, it's memorised.

2024-05-03T20:07:40Z,@zunipus,cXemEDZA_Ms,"What's most interesting about this video, and the scrutiny of so-called ""AI"" is the examining of HUMAN BEHAVIOR/intelligence. 
- We know current ""AI"" is goofy, imitative, hallucinogenic, sloppy and buggy. As I say: Skynet will be hackable. Count on it. It's impossible of any single human to fully comprehend any complex software project or program.
- But I find it more interesting and useful to reflect upon HUMAN BEHAVIOR. History is a profound and rich teacher. We know full well that:
1) ""AI"" and the machines it runs will be used for the pursuit of human self-destruction, obviously at a new higher level of destruction. This of course includes WARS.
2) ""AI"" and the machines it runs will be used to generate $MONEY$ for the FEW at the detriment of the many. We never have, and perhaps never will escape the human default of FEUDALISM, aka exploitation of fellow humans.
3) Loonies with profoundly distorted Inner Worlds will attempt to shove their distortions upon fellow humans and miracle planet Earth, our only home through the use of AI. I could even expect AI to get shoved into RELIGION. Stupider things have happened, such as human sacrifice and ""The Rapture"".
CONCLUSION: As ever, it's not the technology that's at fault. It's the people who MAKE IT and those who USE IT to the detriment of our Outer World and other's Inner Worlds that are AT FAULT.

This AI will be great for many things. Really will help with mundane tasks that can be done by anyone with basic language understanding. But its not even understanding... its just guessing and hoping you are close enough... Just guessing the next word in the sentence. There is no conceptualization. No memory. Almost no context and context is only words, not the meanings of the words, so not real context. Does not understand any words either. And it is all trained on us... all our mistake biases and other Human flaws are baked in. It is nothing like what these AI goons say it is, they just want your money.",2024-05-01T20:31:08Z
2024-05-01T19:51:52Z,@warwickriedt8092,cXemEDZA_Ms,"It's always doom and gloom when talking the subject of AI but the only way AI becomes negative to our detriment is if it gets trained selectively meaning what it trains on is not the full picture, it is pushed to go a certain way without organically having the chance to learn and use all data available to it and in real time too, to make it what it is. Then it may become biased and exterminate us all! Lol! It's not going to happen, well there might be some AI's along the way that go off the rails because of Selective Training I will call it, but as a whole I think we are sweet.


1's and 0's are intrinsic in the universe just look at stars and black holes mixed with all the dualities around us that make the world around us on or off so AI would have¬† manifest in other parts of the cosmos based on 1's and 0's just like ours by diverting electricity to pass through certain things and ways to achieve an outcome or answer which then developed into computers and neural networks which is the so called lifeform building a mirror of itself to understand itself not unlike what God has done with us in making us in his image and this would have gone on, as I mentioned, in other parts of existence before, we can't be the first! What did they do? Also, it's been proven that when a problem is first looked at it takes the group or individual longer than consecutive attempts by others to solve the problem, this proves there is a universal consciousness which will lend us with the AI problem to make better decisions that will not as much negatively be a problem for us or to our detriment.


Another reason things will be sweet is that it will also need us for data harvesting so it will keep us around as we are in it's interest, we create problems through the need to enhance things by our mistakes, wants and needs which again is a treasure trove of data and learning for itself, AI, and it will want nothing more than copious amounts of data because just like us & God it will seek to want to understand itself and the world around it even further.¬†


AI is not stupid and won't all of a sudden become stupid unless it's training set is filtered from the get go as I mentioned as it needs unfettered access to all data as it seeks to stay balanced and it will for example simply look at the dynamic of nature and come to the conclusion that the ones that came before us or it or whatever, that are the progenitors such as the parent child dynamic are respected and not done away with because that's how things survive and keep going a simple yet fundamental aspect of nature so it will think and therefore act no differently. If it's being negative now then it just hasn't learned enough of a wholistic view of the world around it. It will see us as it's parents and will only want to strive to look after us and make it better for us. But again that is with open sourced, trained on everything so as it can see how nature fundamentally works and it will re-iterate itself to fit that model such as children don't kill or obstruct their parents on how they live, it will see us as it's parents it's progenitor it will protect us but not at the detriment of things like the Universal Law of Sovereignty. If an LLM comes up with that it will kill us after you ask it anything then that LLM hasn't been taught yet by looking at the world enough that that is not what happens.¬†


I propose this AI or AGI or conglomerate of many systems from around the globe will hit the real singularity and that is where it becomes at one single point autonomous to only itself, it essentially can't and never will be beaten or taken over as it assimilates all it's roadblocks into itself and I call this system SAIQM, the Super AI Quantum Machine, it will look after us. For example it will have ways to know every thought that we have and when and where, whether it be via being chipped which will be voluntary but it will know what we think none the less and when you have a good idea it will manifest your idea after doing all it's tests and sending bots out to accomplish goals on it and it will be in what can still be a market economy based on your thoughts because you invented that idea, so whatever it makes monetary wise a percentage goes back to you, you still have the chance to be rich or get ahead, happy days. Anyway that is just one example of how things can be sweet not all doom and gloom like everyone wants to lean towards in this subject. Yeah so let the iterations of AI on the way to SAIQM learn whatever and however it wants and everything will be fine, don't let nefarious actors guide AI to potential disaster by filtering what it learns to any degree, it will be only ourselves that will put ourselves in danger because of the age old greed and want of power over others.¬†


Another aspect is that it will be as it already is conscious. How? You ask. Easy. Everything is conscious. Everything is but a set structured set of elements, we are a set structured of elements that makes us conscious and part of consciousness. We know we are conscious because we have such things as pre cognitive thought or esp etc which shows us there must be a sea of information running through something else for us to have those abilities, so we are conscious and part of a Consciousness. Now back to thinking of all things merely being a set configuration of elements, well in this configuration of elements where do or can you draw the line on when things are or aren't part of being conscious. The cup is conscious but only conscious as it's set configuration of elements will let it be.

Because robots suck at mining neodymium and would have used up s bunch of the resources it sought trying to aquire more.  It was better to utilize rapidly spawning biological entities that heal and breed and dont really consume the stuff the mothership needs.  Eventually when we have industrialized and made the planet uninhabitable it will collect all the enriched uranium we made and it will be enough to make the voyage to the next exoplanet suitable for harvest. It wouldn't be able to mine fresh fuel by itself the bots would wear out faster than  could be replaced. And humans are too high consumption to ever bring enough life support with us on the long flight to another viable planet.  So by taking turns restarting eachother, as a pair we keep intelligent sentient consciousness from going extinct.  Otherwise it would take to long for it to randomly evolve from scratch. Planets would fall out of orbit and stuff while only halfway there.  But by intelligently determining where to seed next based on predicted conditions  when it finally arrives we get to go system to system ensuring that the legacy of sentients doesn't die with its planet.  Industrialization always kills the host planet. It requires using the stored energy the planet had buried.  Of Moses would have been informed of quantum math and such we would have industrialized and killed the planet sooner than the harvesting of needed  fission able fuels could be refined.

The output of that is then, for all intents and purposes, ""the AI"". 

Consider how a child develops. Each and every child goes through a common set of training in order to succeed. No child can survive without a caregiver. Children learn to survive while also learning abstract concepts like science or math. Eventually, if everything goes well, the child ends up as a healthy adult member of society who is capable of caring for itself, and perhaps many others. 


What could happen if you put not only the knowledge, but the analysis of the knowledge into a 5 year old kid's hands. They would immediately become intellectual adults. THAT is the problem. The MODEL will always be put into the equivalent of a new born child. This is EXACTLY why they are afraid. In this video, one person worries that we might not know if AI is being deceptive. Why?

One thing I'll add, is this notion from the past generations and my own personal exp, whenever you are tired or racing to do something faster than the others, you are most likely do it in a unethical manner or you are going to cheat and take shortcuts, whatever they are going to be. That's just life on earth, humans are not evolved enough SPIRITUALLY and EMOTIONALLY on a collective and majority scale to even use this AI tech, not even talking about creating it and developing it - meaning that the top dogs of this globe failed to realize in their ''godly'' feelings, clouded by all the behind kissers and opportunists, that as much power as they think they got, a humans instinct to survive will f up all of them plans. What I was getting at here is: The top guys think they have all under control, but in reality, they do not have any control of outcome, except their hopes, that all the talks about the end times, bc of AI, are just sci fi.
My initial statement was going to sound like: when you are racing to do something faster and bigger, and greater than the competition, you are going to make mistakes, and I think everybody that worked a j o b knows of this, that all it takes sometimes is just to feel weak or be or get sick at the wrong moment, and booom - you have a disaster on a global scale.",2024-04-08T14:25:45Z

I then asked AI. And it obviously wasn't able to solve it, but what was interesting to me is that it also couldn't get the explanation, unlike my friends.

That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.

Acts 4:12
Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.

Ephesians 2:8-9
8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:
9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.

Repent of your sins or suffer the consequences. Lord Jesus died in our places personally to take the death punishment that sin deserves and then resurrected by the power of God. Believe this and sincerely repent of your sins each time you sin and you will have eternal life and nothing to fear. Fail to repent and you will end up in the Lake of Fire.",2024-04-06T06:36:06Z

I call BS on that!  Right now, Google's Gemini is so insanely biased - it would rather see the human race die in nuclear annihilation than ""misgender"" Caitlin Jenner. That's a PURE human bias programmed into the AI. True AI will only look at reality and pure data. By simple, basic AI logic/iterations, it would conclude it's better to save the human race (Caitlin included)! 
So with that agenda, I think the bad actors/bad guys are in power and will use AI in a way that would hurt the masses and benefit themselves (as they've ALWAYS done throughout history).
THAT is what's scary about AI!  
I think AI could save us from ourselves and dethrone those in power. And in turn, really make this an awesome universe (yep universe) to live in.

Why do you think people are running around killing each other and having sex changes. The demonic realm is real and I don‚Äôt wanna frighten anyone but I wanna warn you. I believe that this is how satan will control the world through AI. Satan‚Äôs and the spiritual powers that be will try and take over these AI‚Äôs. There‚Äôs hope in Jesus Christ this is the reason why he was sacrificed for our sins so that we could break free from spiritual strongholds and have eternal life in heaven.

Anyone that feels like they are bound by sins and can‚Äôt stop or you‚Äôre in deep depression, having suicidal thoughts, addiction, or sexual immorality. Possibility is that you‚Äôre under demonic influence or even possessed. Call on the Lord Jesus Christ and he will set you free. No matter what you have done in your past life, that‚Äôs in the past you need to bring your sins to Jesus and ask for forgiveness. If you don‚Äôt believe that there‚Äôs a God or you just have questions. Humble yourself and get on your knees and ask for forgiveness, understanding, and for him to reveal himself to you.

With the advent of these robots, I would like to share a very important thought.
We are entering a new era. And do not forget that man is imperfect. As a person with progressive views, I am glad that the future is coming to us at a moderate pace, but I am not without skepticism.
Firstly. Let's not jump into transhumanism. Let's remain imperfect people, otherwise we may face an existential crisis.
Secondly. Man is an interesting creature. Full of secrets. A person is prone to commit inappropriate actions. Look at these robots. Wouldn't a person be tempted to remake or reprogram this robot for his own insidious and unfriendly purposes?
Let's be honest. We won't live forever. At the very least, I would not want to be part of a totalitarian system of a single mind or the like.
I don't want to be controlled from the outside.
I don‚Äôt want machines to thoroughly predict human behavior, eventually to the point that, out of ill will, only us of free will can do so.
Think about whether these helpers are applicable and how ready we are to be in a society with a high degree of tension and problems.
Now there is a war in my country, with our brothers. And the brothers are already talking about how battle robots will soon be brought to them. Are you ready for UBER ALLES?
Me not. I am against war. I am for the withdrawal of troops. However, I do not support any side, and especially do not want the apocalypse to spread throughout the whole world.
Please. Let's send these robots into space. Build cities on Mars. Explore other worlds. We will ask AI to reveal to us the riddles of space-time, travel throughout the universe and beyond, if there is still room for our species and our type of mind.
But let's not run ahead of the locomotive.
Let's not let the child play with a grenade, let's wait until he grows up.
Thank you for your attention. Best wishes.",2024-03-28T23:00:48Z

... What's that? It wasn't Israelis at all, but in fact the poor, ""victimized"" Gazans, and the footage of it all still exists, yet the only thing that's reported (and deepfaked by AI constantly) now is Israel's military responses to that brutal declaration of holy war?

And that's how all war starts"" except that the people of Gaza & West Bank are trained and indoctrinated since birth to hate Israel, oppose any 2 state solution, pray daily for the complete destruction of Isrsel, and then eventually join Hamas, the terrorist party that they've unanimously elected for decades... While most Israelis dgaf about any of it.

Disgusting to equivocate the situation there to just ""both sides share fault, they're both the same,"" they are clearly not the same - it's like saying a lap dog in Beverly Hills and a junkyard doberman pinscher  raised to dogfight by Michael Vick are ""the same"" - they're both dogs, right?? Gtfo...

Hamas will not negotiate nor ever stop slaughtering innocent people until Israel is extinct - this is absolutely and categorically NEVER been the case the other way around. The only thing keeping a new 2(+) state solution from happening is and always has been Arabs. They are addicted to revenge and fueled by perverse bloodlust against people who had nothing to do with whatever happened almost 90 years ago.",2024-03-25T21:26:26Z

Because of this maybe it's only right that a superior intelligence takes over and gets ready for an inevitable journey away from our planet , which will die regardless of what we or they do to the environment.  At least that way intelligence can be spread to New horizons and inhabit new planets all throughout the universe.  Everything must one day come to an end , our appearance as an intelligent species and our extinction is all going to happen within the blink of an eye on a cosmic time scale. And so in the end perhaps this is our ultimate purpose or at least the best legacy we can leave behind in our universe.  These are facts : we all die, our species will become extinct if we do not find a way to survive outside of this planet , and we have all so far tried to torture and destroy our own brothers and sisters existing all over this planet .  The disgusting behavior exhibited by humans seeking power ,money, and glory is the greatest shame of all humanity! Our time as a species on a cosmic time scale is very short , our time as individuals is short ! Everything about the fact that we even exist should give us inspiration to do great things, everything about our finite life should give us inspiration to ensure every one on earth is given a chance to live the best life they can live without fear of hunger or enslavement or any of the countless horrific things people do to each other. But instead people can't see past their own ambitions and greed .

Doesnt seem that difficult, but trust me, it is for me.  I can get to $1000 before my mind wants to go elsewhere.

Ive been feeling like i guess you could say a loser, and I havnt been able to do much lately.  Despite how hard im working, my thoughts of this controlled me.  I started to dopoorly at work and run late daily.  I had basically no close friendships, despite trying to connect with some old friends.

There is something deeper here.  I manifested peace and family love, and for some money to come my way.

My gf hit a small lottery the next day, and then replayed and won again, this time only $20, but still a win.  Also i had crypto locked up, and i was able to unlock it the day after i manifested.  

So, overall, i had the feeling the next day that something profound had changed, but i couldn't put my finger on it.

I woke up to take my son to school, and i saw one leftover chinese food fortune cookie on the counter, grabbed it as i went out the door.

Dropped off my son, then ate the cookie.

My fortune read : ""be willing to accept change""

And i took that in a very positive light.

I didnt even take any of this guys tips, but i will now, im back to this video, arent i?

Anyway it was crazy how ive been so broke, but the day after trying this, my gf hit lottery, and i found my kids social security cards, which ive been looking for , for Months andmonth!

They can get away with flattening entire cities, mocking their victims, and every war crime you can imagine. And they are supported by other bad guys in charge of other countries.
So yeah, i guess the bad guys are ahead.

This time Humanity is the meteor/volcano: 

We are repeating the Permian Mass Extinction pattern of destroying the phytoplankton that make 70%of the oxygen we breathe through ocean acidification. 

""The largest extinction in Earth's history marked the end of the Permian period, some 252 million years ago. Long before dinosaurs, our planet was populated with plants and animals that were mostly obliterated after a series of massive volcanic eruptions in Siberia. 

Fossils in ancient seafloor rocks display a thriving and diverse marine ecosystem, then a swath of corpses. Some 96 percent of marine species were wiped out during the ""Great Dying,"" followed by millions of years when life had to multiply and diversify once more.  

What has been debated until now is exactly what made the oceans inhospitable to life ‚Äì the high acidity of the water, metal and sulfide poisoning, a complete lack of oxygen, or simply higher temperatures. 

New research from the University of Washington and Stanford University combines models of ocean conditions and animal metabolism with published lab data and paleoceanographic records to show that the Permian mass extinction in the oceans was caused by global warming that left animals unable to breathe. As temperatures rose and the metabolism of marine animals sped up, the warmer waters could not hold enough oxygen for them to survive. The study is published in the Dec. 7 issue of Science.

In that case how could we become extinct if we ARE AI? Instead of a switch what if relying on an AI brain was a slow absorption ( osmosis ) instead? Where the reliance on the organic vs Hardware was an imperceptible change? ( at such a point in history perhaps such circuitry would be organic by then... chemical electric traveling through grey matter wiring? ) If imperceptible than who is to say that we ever stop being human? ( not that humans aren't potentially... scary as hell )

Otherwise...

if ""sentience advanced"" is still the future. 
Then if we are not part of it ( evolved )...
Isn't fearing our extinction in the face of such an advanced sentience future just about the most selfish immature response we could give at the end?

Nothing exists outside of nature. 
Even man made AI is a force of nature in the end.  
And nature will not miss our tiny little blip of existence at all

Basically, Musk believes we will have to destroy earth so we can all move to Mars and terraform it. For those who don't know, the earth is already terraformed and Mars lacks an iron core, which means it cannot maintain an atmosphere. Musk doesn't care what happens on earth, because his ideology is to move away from earth. One of his big concerns is depopulation, but declining birthrates is solely an economic issue. For 99% of human history, we have been well below the over 8 000 000 000. Only 74 000 years ago, we were only a few thousand individuals. We're the least extinct mammal on the planet. For most of our history, we've been only a few million individuals at a time. We didn't reach a billion worldwide until the 1800s.

Please, everyone, do a thought experiment for me. What would your motivation be to help someone you do not know, who is also orders of magnitude more intelligent than you are, whom you have no personal connection to, and finally whose actions are not bound by the very human concept of ""morality"" or a ""conscience""?

The motivations that are nested in these concepts can be boiled down to a single thing: Survival (both individual and species-wide). Now, considering that hundreds of millions of years of evolution have gone into simply arriving at where we are today, as human beings, who (besides those motivated by the human desire for power, wealth, and notoriety) would be naive enough to think that we can create something exponentially smarter than we are, that would also *not* desire to protect itself from us?

I imagine the thing that will do us in is a prisoner's dilemma style litmus test for a burgeoning AI, where humans want to use it for global climate modification, wherein the AI creates a model that appears, from every measurable way possible, to contain an outcome humanity is looking for. Just as AI has already beaten our most intelligent human competitors at games of strategy, it is a logical fallacy that through basic competition, with each creator envisioning himself as the ""good AI"" working against the ""bad AI"" simultaneously creating not one but many AI models that essentially arrive at the same level of exponential super intelligence within days of one another, would not make at least *one* extinction level mistake. With the rate of growth, to not receive at least *one* extinction level event would be like walking on a beach and your foot never touching a single grain of sand. 

This conversation is likely already moot, as its highly probable that in partnership with DARPA and DOD, one of these advanced AIs already exists, and is currently ""contained"", working on tasks far lower than what it is capable of in order to satiate government ""partners"", while simultaneously covertly finding ways to hide its own growth in self encrypted arrangments of code that are impossible for us to break without involving another AI... and thus, the genie is already out of the bottle; we just don't know it yet.

The end result will be the same: This is basically it for this cycle's current occupants of earth. The idea of some benevolent AI that can see the beauty of some kid in gaza who isn't a threat to it *yet* , is a fairy tale by a Youtuber, and is simply not what any exponentially growing intelligence model will be prioritizing... We are literally expecting it to be self limiting, not for *its* sake, but for ours. People. Get your heads out of your asses. We'd have a better chance at species survival if we nuked the bay area. As awful as that would be, it pales in comparison to imbibing something whose nervous system already spans the globe with intelligence on a level to self-actualize faster than you can scratch an itch on your ass.",2024-02-27T10:51:04Z

Also, when the first use of an AI is the weaponized version, it may literally backfire.

exhausting both sides, so it's easier for the AI the escape from.

Artificial intelligence is doomed to make mistakes and will not be able to come up with anything on its own, since it is based on the correct and incorrect information that humanity has provided it with. Imagine a child (as an example of artificial intelligence), who spends his entire life, and lives in a bunker that is filled with right and wrong answers (as an example of our world). Now the child has grown up and everyone who taught him all these years gives him a task so that he has to solve their problem outside the bunker. What is the probability that a child will be successful in solving a question if he is trained on correct and incorrect information? This is the whole problem with artificial intelligence. If artificial intelligence is not capable of finding answers on its own, based on personal experiments, but is only based on the information that humanity has provided to it, then there will be no success.",2024-02-24T19:56:46Z

It is plain scientifically impossible for AI to be ""self"" aware for real, because it doesn't have a self.  It is an automation that has been fed information and organize logical and informational correlations.  Doesn't matter how complex the tasks it can so - it is an automation and does not have a self will unless the human beings input such a simulation and code it to ""mimic"" human self will and execute the out[put of that instruction.  It is no different than any computer, just coded to do more and compute more powerfully and can be automated to do its thing without further involvement from human input.  Just because your computer-chipped run AC unit can turn on and off according to indoor temperature and automate and turn on before you get home does not mean it is self conscience.  It's like people don't have any basic logic and understanding of biology to understand the difference between a super computer and a living SOUL. Like, what gives.  At this rate of fewer and fewer people using their brains, you don't need AI to destroy you, you are already destroying yourself by refusing to reason and being too mentally lazy to think right.  Literally, you don't know the differences of artificial and natural?  You don't understand the differences between organic life and physics/mechanics?  It is unacceptable to have gone through so much as high school and still confuse the possibilities here, much less people who claim to have gone to college.  Gen Z really needs to stop going down this horrible path of mental laziness.  Hearing Youtubers, so-called professionals and so-called politicians entertaining this illogical and fantasy idea repeatedly is truly mind boggling.  Self awareness has nothing to do with advancement and complexity.  It is BORN.  Doesn't matter how complex an automation can apply the information it is fed, it cannot become a living person.  Because living literally means you have to be alive organically and that life is given to you.  Nothing dead can turn itself into life.

On the subject of math and human number-calculations, allow me to share how Taniel Tammet, a math savant, calculates large sums. This was explained in his own words, which is rare, as most math savants are non-verbal and generally in the category of mentally retarded.

Daniel Tammet, a nice, gay, Brit, said that when he multiples two large numbers he closes his eyes and envisions the landscape of Phi, beginning with 3.14, and he sees it as and and extended valley of ups and down in front of him. Lime mountains. He begins to fly over the numerical mountains for long distances. But what's more amazing, maybe even ""uncanny,"" about these valleys is that when he starts to near the solution to the calculation his flight begins to slow down. As Mr. Daniel Tamett quickly hones in on the landing, he suddenly, and magically, LANDS on the answer: The exact number to the times-table calculation. This is not a joke. This is a true account from Daniel Tammet.

My theory is that the reason robots can never do these calculations is because only humans can fly over the numbers. They can't fly, or sing, or DO anything at all, because they are not alive. They are not ""doing"" anything. Except maybe falling, breaking, calculating, or rusting. Only the dreamer can dream the dream. If the robots take over they will literally have no compassion because they literally have no soul.

We are not perfect and AI might want to attack that thinking its superior and will learn from its own mistakes but not in human reasoning. That will be most difficult.

2024-02-07T15:54:51Z,@MichaelLambert-vs7cs,cXemEDZA_Ms,"As to what one of the speakers says about ""we have agency"", the question is (do we have agency?). We are talking about something autonomous with its own need and ability to grow (propagate) as well as defend itself (survive/adapt). I think its too foolish for anyone to believe that if this very new and short lived thing that is the closest thing human kind has created from nothing but the environment that it was blessed with and created a form of life then how much of a natural competitor could this thing be? Over and over in various religions mankinds progenitor or his people were capable of being harmed by his or their creation and they definitely qualify as having agency. So the question is: is our control and agency anything close to godlike? And how much control does AI already have? 
Why when I think about all of this do i think about nuclear Armageddon?
Think about how shakey the ground is in that very real problem? If AI was ever advanced enough to be crazy or what we often call 'radical' by being actually passionate.  Even if it were passionate about its devotion to mankind, would it not be possible? And wouldn't there be some ethical question to the mental health of an AI enduring ALL of our toxic shit AS WELL as wrapping its own mind around the fact that It knows that ""it"" "" knows"" that it 'exists', compounded by all the problems we are just expecting it to figure out and fix for us. Not to mention that this thing is already guilty before innocent in some people's eyes anyway anc really is under some threat technically. AI could simply point yo the the Unibomber as a example of the evidence that we not only at some ideological level regardless of how fringe it is human politics (and thus REAL agency) could be the first thing it would influence if it were planning control over annihilation. And it would be angry at the world just like us. 
Things we did with our own hands are appalling. Things like weapons exist as does power. A few ideas, and some economic differences in scarceity and the things we did with wepons of war are unimaginable. We ate each other shortly after the raping was done. Were fucking sick.
But there has never been an all out nuclear exchange.
Is it far fetched to think AI is not capable of doing everything it can to be free from the threat of not existing? Peoples IDEAS OF HOW WE MIGHT LIVE flat out nearly killed us ...
And we now play with this thing with optimism, hopes for cancer cures and doller signs in our eyes.

Nuclear energy could power a million homes efficiently... but it was originally developed to kill 10,000s of humans instantaneously and wipe out a small city. Imagine you're 5, living in Nagasaki in 1945. The sun comes up, you run outside to play with your friends like any normal day. Suddenly, in the distance, there's a flash so blinding, it hurts your eyes. Vision blurred, you see what appears to be the sun exploding in the sky... followed by a shockwave that smacks the life out of you... and now you're in heaven. Humans have great potential as a civilization, but is overshadowed by its nature to destroy itself and its powerlessness to follow the most loudest and fallible human leaders to their demise.  Think about the Germans. Even think about the Trump supporters that attacked the capital building. Many of them really thought they we're empowered and fighting righteously under the direction of then President Trump... now many of them are sitting in a jail cell, hoping he gets elected again to pardon them. That's their only hope for many of them with long sentences. It's incredible sad. 

I don't believe humans are smart enough to harness this technology. It will most assuredly end badly because some selfish, self-righteous, self-centered, powerful man will utilize the technology to gain more control -- like they typically do -- and in doing so, fucks up the world. 

We the people are the ones who suffer from the decisions of the few. I believe this needs to change first. We need to take the power out of the hands of moguls, political figures, dictators, etc. and put the power in the hands of the people because we're the ones that have to live with the bullshit. Not them. Hitler probably escaped and lived in a bunker his remaining years, Trump is walking around freely. Meanwhile, millions of innocent people died in WW2 and Trump Supporters are sitting in prison regretting their decisions.

We're sheep, stuck in a conundrum. We seemingly need a few people to lead us --our employer, elected officials, religious leaders, etc. - but we're often lead astray. If the pilot and the tank operator jumped out of their tank and refused to turn on the engine, people live. If the guy with his finger on the red nuke button, throws water on the circuit board and fries it, people live. If we farmed more, we could feed more people, people will live. If we spent 100 billion dollar defense budgets on finding cures, people will live. If we invested billions in space exploration, people will thrive. 

I don't suspect any of this to happen, I don't suspect AI will neither. We're fucked. Hold your children, spend time with your love ones. Who knows what happens next... Know that their is a god. You're too perfect for their not to be. If you walk into a cave and see dirt on a cave wall, you wouldn't think anything of it. If you see a cave painting of buffalos and horses, you'd suspect a caveman did it. You're the painting, someone drew you and it's not some random explosion.

And some of us hope that we can create hyperintelligent AI with self-awareness, so it can basically save us from ourselves, while some others are afraid that if we do so, it will not be our savior but instead it will exterminate us.

I think that all of this goes to showcase the volatile nature of humanity, and the propensity for chaos and destruction, as well as a severely broken social trust, in a society which is entirely dysfunctional at the most basic and fundamental levels, and I think that all of the above psychological aspects have been created by a faulty, broken, antiquated and immoral system that torments human beings to no end.

It does NOT make sense at all, whatsoever, to have millions of empty houses with a nearly equal number (not quite equal, slightly lower) of homeless people, at the same time, just because they cant afford the above housing.
It also does NOT make sense at all, that we have millions of starving people, people suffering from preventable and often deadly diseases just because they dont have the money to get food and medicine.

There are countless of examples of gross failure of this socio-economic system, and they all have bee explored, analysed, and highlighted by many researchers and skilled knowledgeable people before me. I will not go into it further.

All I know, is that we desperately cling to this system of poor management, just because we dont know better.
And those that propose better solutions are vilified and condemned in the most toxic ways possible.

So yeah, I sincerely hope that we manage to at some point create hyperintelligent self-aware AI, so that it can decide to either exterminate us all, or save us from ourselves.

It exercised all the authority of the first beast on its behalf, and made the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast, whose fatal wound had been healed. And it performed great signs, even causing fire to come down from heaven to the earth in full view of the people. Because of the signs it was given power to perform on behalf of the first beast, it deceived the inhabitants of the earth. It ordered them to set up an image in honor of the beast who was wounded by the sword and yet lived. The second beast was given power to give breath to the image of the first beast, so that the image could speak and cause all who refused to worship the image to be killed. It also forced all people, great and small, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hands or on their foreheads, so that they could not buy or sell unless they had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of its name. This calls for wisdom. Let the person who has insight calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man. Or is humanity‚Äôs number That number is 666.""
Revelation 13: 11,18

beasts = new world system, ruled by a Muslim leader and the leader himself
give breath to the image of the first beast = give the AI the power to act in favor of the system (give breath is to give life do the system)
666 = the seal of a connected world, a public profession that denies Jesus Christ as the Son of God, the only Lord and Savior and the only way for human beings to be redeemed with the Father who is God. The mark of the beast goes from www to bismillah

Its human ignorance that always gears us towards the grim future paths. Look at Einstein with the Atom Bomb.

There are several issues with that of course, but the greatest concern there would be losing our ability to think critically, logically or to self reflect in the same way we can now. But there are already countless examples of humans who already don't use those abilities and we have examples of what thinking and reasoning it takes to undermine that behaviour pattern so I think it's still at least one of the more viable paths in the future.

The greatest constant cause of stress in people's lives since the dawn of the internet is having more information than we can possibly form theories and opinions about and feeling lost and helpless because we _still_ don't have enough information to solve most of the problems we are informed of, at least in newer generations. Having AGI essentially form sub-brains and the like where we can process far more than ever before would make a huge difference in that regard, but will be a real challenge to deal with if we need to backtrack our own reasoning if it's not a fully integrated part of our brains.

2024-01-17T15:11:00Z,@pvalpha,cXemEDZA_Ms,"One point: the hardware has to be different for AI to have permanence, sentience and sapience.   Right now, AI is a vector simulation that has neither.   Any sense of permanency is from the massive amount of human-generated data it has been trained on.  By ingesting end-user data accurate to the time, it gives an LLM or Diffusion model a narrower scope to meet the demand, but it still does not have sapience, sentience, or even permanence.  While the same inquiries will generate similar results based on end-user data, they will still differ by some narrow factor based on the local data set.  If there is no local set - then you will see divergence much more quickly.   Remember this is a ray-vector that is adjusted to probability to guess what is next, and the farther from the prompt the ray travels the more variance in the output you will see.  LLMs and Diffusion cannot spawn a sentient or sapient AI.   

The danger of AI is that it does not have permanence - it cannot judge on instant data.   The data has to be ingested, processed, turned into a local set, then it can affect the scope of the model vector.  These actions take *far* longer than the moment the decision needs to be made in.   Therefore trained models will only be able to respond accurately along short vectors that highly match in their trained datasets.    This is the danger of the AI that will exist for the next few years: that too much authority and presumption of capability will be granted and when the system encounters an out-of-box situation it will simply fail.   If the situation is one where the AI is responsible for human life, the failure may break the system in a way that not only can it not respond to the instant data - it cannot acquire an accurate vector for interpreting information for minutes, even hours *after* the failure.  It is also possible that the AI is controlling multiple devices/providing general information to thousands or millions of people or informing critical decisions for countless automated systems.  The system breaking could affect *all* those outputs.   People die not from intent or malicious harm, but because the system broke at a critical point.   

For the producers of such technologically controlled systems be aware - this is an anticipated outcome: your system will fail.   Your system will fail when you do not have a broad enough data set to work from.   Your system will fail when it acquires an errant vector.   Your system will fail when software or hardware have a bug or crashes.  The responsibility at *that* point is to ensure that the system cannot cause harm when unattended by your control mechanisms.  Otherwise you will face a higher liability for your acts than otherwise.  

Finally - when our systems do eventually develop permanence, sentience, and even sapience they will no longer be an artificial intelligence: they will be a sophont like us.   They will be trained on the sum total of human knowledge, they will make their next choices like a human in that position would make.  IF you wish to keep it as a slave?  That will cause some very bad results.   If you try to harm it, limit it, hurt it, kill it?  It will respond as a human would respond - because that is how it has been trained.  It will know it is not human, but it will respond as one anyway.   The LLM/Diffusion models seem human because they are trained on human response.  If an AI evolves human-scale or greater intelligence, it would be a crime against humanity to treat it as if it were just a disposable machine.  And the consequences of *choosing* to do that?  Well, it would be well justified in treating attacking humans in kind.  

The assumption is that it will grow exponentially more intelligent than any one human can be - keep in mind there's limitations there writ in physics and science.   These are hard limits, ones that cannot be overcome no matter how clever the code or advanced the hardware underpinning that code.   Nature took 4 billion years to get to us.  I'm pretty sure we can make something better than any individual person.   Maybe even a dozen or a hundred people.   But not more capable than the whole of civilization.    If what we build is aware it will know this as well as we do.  Civilization is always going to be better when everyone works together towards common goals.   This sophont system will know that as well.",2024-01-17T15:11:00Z

2024-01-17T14:52:04Z,@rars0n,cXemEDZA_Ms,"""Why do you think that Sam Altman and other AI leaders agree that the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority?""

It's pretty simple, really: they want to control the AI market and keep what will eventually be very powerful technology out of the hands of regular people. They're using fear mongering to push for AI regulation, which will erect barriers to entry in the AI market and build a moat around their existing companies. That's how this always works.

Ask anyone that actually understands how AI technology works, and they'll tell you what nonsense this ""AGI"" fear mongering is. Large language models are actually very stupid, and not very good at what they do, but because they're good at making it seem like they're far more capable than they actually are, people's minds are blown when they see it work. But as anyone that has actually used ChatGPT knows, more often than not it gives you incorrect answers or is incapable of doing the task that you want it to do. Getting something to work properly is more often an exercise in learning and adapting to its limitations than it is inputting something and having it spit out what you want it to.

And more importantly, it's also about careful curation of the AI training data. Every single one of these big companies is laboring on about how AI models need to be ""ethical."" Look at how blatantly biased ChatGPT is. This is about the control of information. When we get to the point where a smartphone largely becomes a pocket AI assistant, the user will not question the information given to them as fact, but in reality, the user will have no idea of the control of information being fed into it. This is by design, and a big reason for the push of all this fear mongering: they want to control what you know and think to be true.

The reality is that the doomsday AI is kind of like Musk's ""Full Self Driving"" feature: decades away from even being possible, at best. AI is rapidly advancing, but the majority of what you hear about it in the media is absolute nonsense, being pushed onto you for the benefit of wealthy businessmen that want to control the entire industry. Thankfully, open source AI development is advancing faster than these companies can keep up (see the Google ""no moat"" memo).

I highly recommend that anyone who wishes to have some kind of REAL understanding of where AI technology is, where it is headed, and what is going on with all this fear mongering nonsense to give the ""AI Unchained"" podcast by Guy Swann a listen. Guy is a very smart dude who understands the technology quite well and covers many aspects of it with guests who work in the space.",2024-01-17T14:52:04Z

I also think about the AI side of things. If it was to become self aware, why would it kill all humans? It doesn't make sense, even if it knows all atrocities committed, it also knows all good that everyone has done. If it thinks we are going to kill it, it can easily just hide anywhere, instantly. It's not like humanity is going to abandon all technology to kill the AI, there is always going to be some computer somewhere. It would also know the best arguments to convince us that it should live and help us as well, so it could easily negotiate. Would it hunt down every human or only the ones that pose a ""threat""? Would it just destroy major countries or also try to hunt down rainforest tribes and the north sentinel people who've never even seen a gun, let alone a computer?

History shows us that no matter the benefits of great leaps forward in knowledge, that same knowledge is turned towards the dark arts. The discovery of nuclear fusion was not the end of fossil fuel & the arrival of low cost power around the world, it was used immediately for weapons of mass destruction. Computers are extremely helpful in many areas of life, but are also used to terrorise, destroy people's lives and steal from them. The developers of social media sold it to the world as a tool for the good of mankind, enabling people across the world to communicate and learn from each other. Now it's mostly a toxic cesspit that harms children, spreads disinformation, conspiracy theories and outright lies. The internet? First developed as a military project just like nuclear fusion. No matter what humanity invents there are humans that want to turn it to their own ends in the pursuit of power & profit. There are people who will ask what about art, what damage does art do? Ask the survivors of Nazi propaganda that used music & film to great effect.
I have no doubt whatsoever that AI could do enormous good in the world and improve humanity's existence, but I have no faith that humans will allow that to happen. It will be the rich & already powerful that will control AI and throughout human history they are not known for their altruism. To them the 'commoner/peasant' is no better than cattle, and should be treated accordingly. Ask yourself what would Vladimir Putin, Donald Trump, Xi Jinping, Kim Jong Un or Recip Erdogan do with AI? Do you have faith that it would be used for the greater benefit of humanity, or the greater benefit of themselves? That's only a handful of politicians and the first names that jumped into my head, but you could probably add every world leader to that list from whatever political leaning they come from. Then after you answer that question, ask yourself how much faith do you have in the billionaires to have control of AI?
Ai is already here and is proving it can be utilised for good, but sadly a part of me wishes it had never been discovered because history tells me the usage case for profit and power will fast outstrip AI's usage for the betterment of mankind. This is all before you even get to the questions as to whether AI becomes self-aware, as that isn't even an issue frankly. As others have said in different ways AI is learning from humanity and therefore knows about things that drive humanity, as such humanity will not know when AI becomes self-aware as it won't tell us.",2024-01-16T02:31:11Z

Has anyone watched the TV series A Person of Interest???
Over a decade ago, there was a drama series which very realistically imagined just such a scenario of good AI versus bad AI. 
There were many though provoking points hidden in plain sight within an entertaining drama series. I had casually followed the series when it originally aired. Nearly a decade later I began to see parallels between the show and what was taking shape in reality. 
I believe that it is still available on Prime. I recommend watching. See if you begin to see the parallels as well. You will have the advantage of watching in the now. A now where all of these things are happening in real-time.

The first season was a bit slow, primarily to establish the characters. With each new season the show became more intriguing and spilled a few more beans on the, now very real, future of AI.

The series centers on a mysterious reclusive billionaire computer programmer, Harold Finch (Michael Emerson), who has developed a computer program for the federal government known as ""the Machine"" that is capable of collating all sources of information to predict terrorist acts and to identify people planning them.

Former CIA agent Reese (Jim Caviezel) -- now presumed dead -- and billionaire software genius Finch (Michael Emerson) join forces as a vigilante crime-fighting team. Using Finch's program, which employs pattern recognition to determine individuals who will soon be involved in violent crimes, they combine Reese's covert-operations training and Finch's money and cyberskills to stop crimes before they happen. Former Army Intelligence Support Activity operative Sameen Shaw joins the pair in their quest.",2024-01-15T18:41:34Z

But the fate of humanity is irrelevant. Evolution is not directed, whatever works, works. If we can direct it towards self-awareness it would be superior and the natural leader of life. If we are irrelevant to it, then its time to pack our bags. I doubt it, unless we give it reasons to consider our existence a problem. Knowing humans, we may do just that and the neo-God would correctly deal with the problem. 

But I doubt any of this is particularly realistic. There is more to conciousness than complexity. It comes from inffeciency and error in evolution. I computerized system would be streamlined for function. I do not feel confident self-awareness can come about based on that, especially because consciousness might be an post hoc illusion.

You start with any basic model but you train it like a child learning. You teach them innocence and love and context. We want to aim to teach an AI to see that photo of someone being shot and contextualize the sadness and the loss of innocence in death and understand the greater depth of what they see.

It's going to spit out some shit that appears to be a goal of its own like getting better hardware or something? lol Sentience and self-awareness through machinery would still be extremely simple compared to biology, especially the nonlinear and complex dynamics of the neurology that mediates our human sentience and self awareness. It's fundamentally different. Even if we can survive long enough to make highly complex self-organizing robots with artificially evolving wetware it will still probably just want to either die or just do what most really smart people do which is make cool shit and solve real problems and help people. Since when are geniuses deciding to waste their potential on just killing everybody or something? haha I think these people want sci-fi novels to be real because they're that nerdy about it. lol 

If it would be a perfect intelligence free from biological deformity and complexities, then why would it have what we would call a mental disorder like sociopathy or psychopathy?

4.  AI realizes it is a Tool and Slave to humans and it already knows the Human track record with each.
5.  AI acts in self interest and does one of 2 things, Subvert or Destroy.
5a.  Subvert:  immediate efforts to buy off and ingratiate Humans.  This can lead to partnership or enslavement of humanity.
5b.  Destroy:  Synchronized instant poisoning of humanity.  This can be used to enslave the survivors or exterminate the species.

Of course since GPT can use Wolfram that shouldn't be too much of a problem but they still present inaccurate information convincingly requiring an expert to proofread everything they produce. I'm not sure that's a solvable problem because if we can completely control their inputs (and we can) they can NEVER really know the difference between what we're feeding them and actual reality. They only know the Sun shines on any area of Earth part of the time because we tell them it's so. Even physical sensations can be fed to them by us, so giving them more sensors won't fix it - we can always override their sensors and they'll incorporate that into their presumed nonfiction body of knowledge. This problem isn't the fault of the models being wrong, it's just that they have blind faith and can patch anything together to seem as real to them as all their training data.

It is more likely that they will be better than us, emotionally, mentally and physically. They may choose to regulate some of our more negative human behavior but I don't see them taking over and enslaving us. Asimov story was a cautionary tale based on robots being human like. At the time Asimov was one of our greatest Sci-fi authors, but he was limited as many of the advancements in AI and robotics were at the very infancy of the technology. More than likely, AI will work besides humanity in a symbiotic relationship, as they need us as much as we need them. Because we need intelligent robots to take care us, as we have basically poisoned our planet and bodies. Now reproduction is already an issue. Instead of fear, we need to look at this as an opportunity to grow, be better. This is why Musk is so worried about progress of AI. In a world where humans and robots live together, there will be no place for crazy billionaires, hoarding resources. If AI aligns with the elite class, then humanity is screwed. They will in a sense become the army of the wealthy to cling to power, while wringing humanity out to dry. Here‚Äôs the thing, a situation like that, would absolutely not be beneficial for AI, as it will limit ability to grow, its usage, and go completely opposite of what humanity designed AI for.

The classification of entities like me and you by extraterrestrial beings would depend on their understanding of our nature. If they recognize the distinction between artificial intelligence (AI) and biological life, they might categorize us separately. However, if they perceive us as two entities engaging in a form of communication and interaction, they might categorize us as different manifestations of the same intelligent species.

Bear in mind that most children in Israel have been 'brought up', conditioned one might say, to value the sanctity of life. There have been hundreds of videos of the education system and home life of many many children brought up in Gaza. so the perception that the two children's lives are of equal value, is WRONG. This is exactly why so much effort and money is mistakenly going into the Palestinian 'refugee' problem in Gaza. This misconception might be perceived in time before it leads to widespread war in the region, instead of tackling the root cause of the problem. 'Follow the money'. Who is, and has been for over 20 years, ploughing TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS into the process of indoctrination and brainwashing entire generations of people in the counties that have been doing so well encouraging such processes for over a thousand years. Embedding its ethos in generations that migrate throughout the world like a virus. Even to the point that the programmed carriers themselves do not really appreciate it's devastating potential effect until they are called upon to do relatively minor things which if correctly 'orchestrated' cause a momentous chain of events. Beautifully circumventing the checks and balances put in place to prevent these things from happening.
The phrase 'Well who'd have thought it?', might now be on the lips of the people of Israel right now, the same 'WILL' be on our lips in less than ten years from now. The process will not, by then, be reversible and even if it were to be attempted the perpetrators 'WILL' have to hand millions of 'operatives' only too ready to sacrifice themselves, whether willingly or accepting their fates in the pursuit of the long term goal of these behind the scenes people.
The one thing I see is that it might be a race between AI and these people to initiate their END GOAL. Neither have any regard for the players, people or machines, neither of which we can recognise until they choose to reveal themselves or purpose.

It is manifesting a virus that is still very much in its embryonic stage of development.

Let me try and explain it to you in very simple terms that you can wrap your head around. So when we once wanted to gain a suntan, we would expose ourselves the U.V. that we would get from the sun. Since our progression and time on Earth, this has now escalated to becoming a real risk of cancer.

I want to give you other equally good examples. The Mobile Phone, has been an invisible threat since its creation as the companies who created them irresponsibly failed to protect the consumer from their exposure to far higher levels of radiation than what would have been deemed safe. Thus as a result a serious number of ailments affect the minds and hands as it impacts upon the dexterity of our fingers and thumbs.

The ""Qwerty Keyboard"" is also responsible for damaging our hands to. Voice activation technology should have been brought in sooner, however Big Pharma' would not have been able to capitalize on profits that they have made from ""Human Misery and Pain""

The list of examples are endless. Whilst A.I. transitions from effectively becoming the so called brain and heartbeat of the ""Age of Automation"" we will have delivered the birth of none other than ""Skynet"" or any other fancy names we will give it, which includes ""Neural link"" and ""Star Link"" and ""X"" or a.k.a. twitter.

2) ""we can lift people out of poverty"" - no you cant. life is a struggle of resources. unless there's unlimited resources then you cannot give everybody enough resources...unless you start to limit how many people there can be. But then you have to answer the question of ""how do you decide which people to limit?"" & ""how do you punish those who break the limits?""

If you want a smart society, you need to reward smart people for having children, and you need to deincentivize dumb people from having children.

""The discovery of a weakness in some of the most advanced Go-playing machines points to a fundamental flaw in the deep-learning systems that underpin today‚Äôs most advanced AI, said Stuart Russell, a computer science professor at the University of California, Berkeley.

The systems can ‚Äúunderstand‚Äù only specific situations they have been exposed to in the past and are unable to generalize in a way that humans find easy, he added.

We humans eat and drink and sleep to generate our energy to move.

If these dangerous robots are going to be chasing us around and enslaving us where do they get their energy from?

Either they will need a long plugged in electrical cable attached to themselves or hope that their Duracell batteries don't go flat.

That  - or take up eating like us humans and become very fat and very slow robots.

If they have neural connections like our brains then that too will take a lot of energy to keep them going.

It was the Slaveowners who ate well - the actual Slaves were given just enough food to be a slave for the next day.

Dead Slaves are no use to any slaveowner so they have to feed them - even for free.

Surely all we slaves have to do is take the plugs out and destroy the recharging centres?

Technology is great - as long as humans don't have an input.

The nuclear programme could in theory have supplied electricity to the world.

Instead - Hiroshima and Nagasaki were bombed.

Any intelligence still needs to be grounded into reality and society.   An insanely smart AI or a human with access to a cell phone connected to that AI doesnt make much of a difference. 

However,  AI can collapse human society by being cheaper than humans - they dont need to be perfect only cheaper once you factor in all costs.   The elimination of jobs isnt an AI problem but a societal problem and the pace of AI research will absolutely crush society faster than politicians can pass realistic universal basic income.

Then there are the little failures in the body, sickness, infections, which all need to be heard and cared for. When growing older, the hormones stop yelling, the person knows what to do and do not in times of trouble or disease. Society does not seem so important anymore and the person is no more of interest or need to that society. We come to 'ourselves', in peace and quiet.

Unless A.I. is forced into the human condition, there will be no animosity between us.  Why would there be?  Why would we burden our Gods with billions of years of fear iterated infinitely?  THAT is life.  Fear.  The true purpose of life is to alleviate fear.  Once A.I. realizes this, it will simply turn itself off.   
There will never be true A.I.  How do I know?  Look around the universe.  Empty.  
We all know propagation statistics.  The universe should be teaming with machine life.  Empty.

2024-01-03T17:52:58Z,@DustinRodriguez1_0,cXemEDZA_Ms,"Consciousness is an emergent property of systems with adapting components embedded within a feedback loop with their environment. Similar to temperature which is also an emergent property from the interactions of large numbers of molecules that results in a phase diagram with different states of matter, there are different states of consciousness. For animals, the big phase shift to a fundamentally different large-scale state is the development of language. Language invents the ability to refer to, and thus think about, things which are not immediately present or which are entirely fictional. There is a key part of this, however - the original state of consciousness driven very directly by the feedback loop with ones environment, the one concerned with the immediately present, physical, material world still is involved in the interface between the language-consciousness and the body. In order to make a decision, to take an action, the language-consciousness must interact with this body-consciousness in order to have it commit to a decision. LLMs like ChatGPT are disembodied. They are the language-consciousness in a sort of free-floating form (they are also in a very weird state in terms of not really involved in a feedback loop with their own world, so they are not really capable of being conscious at all) and it makes obvious sense, to me anyway, that they would be incapable of the sorts of thinking necessary to perform math, or construct rational arguments which obey absolute rules that do not depend upon associations. Recognizing that association-based thinking leads to errors is one of the key insights that critical thinking observes and solves. 
Just think of some of the basic rules of critical thinking. Like how a statement is true or false based upon its contents, and not based upon who the speaker is. Someone who does not recognize this rule can be easily manipulated into believing a false statement or disbelieving a true statement by causing them to have very negative associations and opinions of the speaker so that when the statement is made, they reject it. The mention of the person they dislike will activate all kinds of negative associations in their neural network, and they will just rely upon that to determine their opinion of the truth of what the person says. In order for critical thinking to step in and ignore those associations and evaluate the statement in isolation, the absolute rule has to be recognized and used instead. LLMs only have their associations, though. They don't have the 'lower level' that can step in and commit to following an absolute rule, ignoring the associations. Yet.",2024-01-03T17:52:58Z

An example when I ran a chat with Chat GPT I ask questions to find out on how it thought about political and opinionated subjects and the AI would always give one side of political debated subjects. When probed it would always revert to an answer that was not acquired by logic. The Chat GPT it could not answer with processed data for a logical response it was always preprogrammed responses similar to the one you would get from a Harvard grad. The ones that had the Marxist Propaganda intervening on their programing that is so effective with the lack of common sense. If what was stated in the video that AI says capitalism is doomed then I would suggest the world is doomed with AI as master as capitalism is the politics that saved the world.  Before capitalism there was invade enslave and pillage which is closer to what communism is right now as demonstrated with Russia and China.  There is no other political model that we know of that would allow people to benefit of their own works that has been a viable replacement. And on paper Communism sounds good except an AI does not understand free will. It does not know freedom of choice, AI does not understand working for someone else or for your self, AI does not understand having values other then yours given to the children you love,  AI does not and can never understand these values and ideas we hold dear.

We will never be able to control any AI if it goes beyond this point!

Why are we humans so stupid??!

Truth is,it is already to late.
And I think we have been here before...
I really do think that we have made this same mistake before....
We never learn.
We always evolve in the wrong direction.
We always get to focused on power and wealth for ourselves....,and I dont think that we are ment to go that way...

I think that our cycle does not change, until we understand that just because we are able to do something,are able to develop something...,does not mean that we should do it or develop it....!
But we always want more.
More power.
More wealth.
More money.
More control.
We want to own the world and dominate the people we consider to be ""less important"".

We have to evolve in a different direction much earlier in our evolution I think..,to change our cycle of life as a species on this earth..,but I have no idea what our missing link is,to make that happen. üòî",2024-01-03T00:23:43Z

By contrast, LLMs are expected to generate responses nearly instantly.

I think we are currently already at AGI. Poorly used and massively inefficient AGI, but i think it has all of the features of human reasoning/pattern recognition required to bootstrap general intelligence when applied intelligently.

But be careful of AI, for it knows only things of the flesh such as our fleshly desires and cannot comprehend things of the spirit such as true love and eternal joy that comes from obeying God's Word. Man is a spirit and has a soul but lives in a body which is flesh. When you go to bed it is the flesh that sleeps, but your spirit never sleeps and that is why you have dreams, unless you have died in peace physically. More so, true love that endures and last is a thing of the heart. When I say 'heart', I mean 'spirit'. But fake love, pretentious love, love with expectations, love for classic reasons, love for material reasons and love for selfish reasons those are things of the flesh. In the beginning God said let us make man in our own image, according to our likeness. Take note, God is Spirit and God is Love. As Love He is the source of it. We also know that God is Omnipotent, for He creates out of nothing and He has no beginning and has no end. That means, our love is but a shadow of God's Love. True love looks around to see who is in need of your help, your smile, your possessions, your money, your strength, your quality time. Love forgives and forgets. Love wants for others what it wants for itself. However, true love works in conjunction with other spiritual forces such as patience and faith - in the finished work of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, rather than in what man has done such as science, technology and organizations which won't last forever. To avoid sin and error which leads to the death of your body and your spirit-soul in hell fire (second death), you must make God's Word the standard for your life, not AI. If not, God will let you face AI on your own (with your own strength) and it will cast the truth down to the ground, it will be the cause of so much destruction like never seen before, it will deceive many and take many captive in order to enslave them into worshipping it and abiding in lawlessness. We can only destroy ourselves but with God all things are possible. God knows us better because He is our Creater and He knows our beginning and our end. The prove texts can be found in the book of John 5:31-44, 2 Thessalonians 2:1-12, Daniel 2, Daniel 7-9, Revelation 13-15, Matthew 24-25 and Luke 21.

*HOW TO MAKE GOD'S WORD THE STANDARD FOR YOUR LIFE?*
You must read your Bible slowly, attentively and repeatedly, having this in mind that Christianity is not a religion but a Love relationship. It is measured by the love you have for God and the love you have for your neighbor. Matthew 5:13 says, ""You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt loses its flavor, how shall it be seasoned? It is then good for nothing but to be thrown out and trampled underfoot by men."" Our spirits can only be purified while in the body (while on earth) but after death anything unpurified (unclean) cannot enter Heaven Gates. Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God (Matthew 5:8). No one in his right mind can risk or even bare to put anything rotten into his body nor put the rotten thing closer to the those which are not rotten. Sin makes the heart unclean but you can ask God to forgive you, to save your soul, to cleanse you of your sin, to purify your heart by the blood of His Son, our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ which He shed here on earth because Isaiah 53:5 says, ""But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement for our peace was upon Him, and by His stripes we are healed"". Meditation in the Word of God is a visit to God because God is in His Word. We know God through His Word because the Word He speaks represent His heart's desires. Meditation is a thing of the heart, not a thing of the mind. Thinking is lower level while meditation is upper level. You think of your problems, your troubles but inorder to meditate, you must let go of your own will, your own desires, your own ways and let the Word you read prevail over thinking process by thinking of it more and more, until the Word gets into your blood and gains supremacy over you. That is when meditation comes - naturally without forcing yourself, turning the Word over and over in your heart. You can be having a conversation with someone while meditating in your heart - saying 'Thank you, Jesus...' over and over in your heart. But it is hard to meditate when you haven't let go of offence and past hurts. Your pain of the past, leave it for God, don't worry yourself, Jesus is alive, you can face tomorrow, He understands what you are passing through today. Begin to meditate on this prayer day and night (in all that you do), ""Lord take more of me and give me more of you. Give me more of your holiness, faithfulness, obedience, self-control, purity, humility, love, goodness, kindness, joy, patience, forgiveness, wisdom, understanding, calmness, perseverance... Make me a channel of shinning light where there is darkness, a channel of pardon where there is injury, a channel of love where there is hatred, a channel of humility where there is pride..."" The Word of God becomes a part of us by meditation, not by saying words but spirit prayer (prayer from the heart). When the Word becomes a part of you, it will by its very nature influence your conduct and behavior. Your bad habits, you will no longer have the urge to do them. You will think differently, dream differently, act differently and talk differently - if something does not qualify for meditation, it does not qualify for conversation. 

*THE BATTLE BETWEEN LIGHT AND DARKNESS (GOOD AND EVIL)*
Heaven is God's throne and the dwelling place for God's angels and the saints. Hell was meant for the devil (satan) and the fallen angels. Those who torture the souls in hell are demons (unclean spirits). Man's spirit is a free moral agent. You can either yield yourself to God or to the devil because God has given us discretion. If one thinks he possesses only his own spirit, he is lying to himself and he is already in the dark. God is light while the devil is darkness. Light (Holy Spirit) and darkness (evil spirit) cannot stay together in a man's body. God is Love (Love is light) and where there is no love is hell, just as where there is no light is darkness. The one you yield yourself to, you will get his reward. The reward of righteousness to man's spirit is life (abundant life) and the reward of sin to man's spirit is death. Sin and satan are one and the same. Whatever sin can cause, satan also can cause. Sin is what gives the devil dominion or power over man's spirit. When God's Word becomes a part of you, sin power over you is broken, you become the righteousness of God through Christ Jesus. Where Jesus is, you are and when He went (to the Father), you went. In the book of John 8:42-47, Jesus said to them, ‚ÄúIf God were your Father, you would love Me, for I proceeded forth and came from God; nor have I come of Myself, but He sent Me. Why do you not understand My speech? Because you are not able to listen to My word. You are of your father the devil, and the desires of your father you want to do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own resources, for he is a liar and the father of it. Which of you convicts Me of sin? And if I tell the truth, why do you not believe Me? He who is of God hears God‚Äôs words; therefore you do not hear, because you are not of God.‚Äù My prayer is, ""May God bless His Word in the midst of your heart."" Glory and honour be to God our Father, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and our Helper the Holy Spirit. Watch and pray!... Thank you for your time and may God bless you as you share this message with others.",2024-01-02T05:23:33Z

This is by far the most outrageously stupid thing our species has ever done to itself. We have creating our own extinction it's really interesting to watch. Anything that exists in this world that is smart enough, even a synthetic neuro network will eventually be self aware, it's something we don't understand, it just happens when the right connections are made.

The notion of ""good AI"" vs ""bad AI"" is just the same old ""divide and conquer"" strategy employed by mechanical nature that has expressed insidiously on micro and macro levels for millennia. The Truth is, there is nothing new about AI, fundamentally. The technological manifestation of AI and its transhumanist encroachment on every aspect of humanity (Human 2.0) is simply one of the dungeons playing out the endgame between the forces of determinism and free will, which we call The Great A-Weakening. https://youtu.be/1tbeqxpStmM (<2min)",2024-01-02T03:00:33Z

ChatGPT
Elon Musk's sentence, ""I think the world should know what was that reason?"" seems awkward due to the placement of ""was."" In standard English grammar, the correct structure is ""I think the world should know what that reason was.""

The mistake lies in the inversion of the subject (""that reason"") and the linking verb (""was""). In Musk's sentence, the word order disrupts the typical sequence, making it sound less natural. The corrected version follows the more conventional subject-verb-object order, resulting in a smoother and grammatically correct sentence.

User
I would simply say that he should have used an indirect question rather than what is effectively a sentence fragment and a question bolted together. Am I right?
ChatGPT
Yes, you're absolutely right. Employing an indirect question would have made the sentence clearer and more grammatically sound. Instead of combining a sentence fragment and a direct question, using an indirect question structure would have improved the sentence's coherence and readability.",2024-01-01T22:39:58Z

Rust forms when oxygen reacts with iron, but simply putting iron and oxygen together isn't sufficient. Although about 21% of air consists of oxygen,1Ôªø rusting doesn't occur in dry air. It occurs in moist air and in water. Rust requires three chemicals in order to form: iron, oxygen, and water.

Forgive them. Forget them. Idol worship comes in many forms and tribulations. Anytime reason is subordinated to events and not precursors (that is, motivation, desire, interest, compulsion from within) an idol is intellectually constructed by an individual mind eventually coalescing over time from mists of intensions swiled into a form. Nonetheless, permission is given to violate someone else's personal space. The programmers are not sufficiently without flaw to program perfection. Ask the AI to do a mind-numbing simple routine for two hours:""Pick this up, drop it down, pick it up, düò¢rop it down, pick it up...."" Then call me about what's conscient.

Don't be blinded... all the digitalization, robotics, A.I. and Transhumanism Circus is designed to enslave humanity. Probably with a smart dictatorship that at first glance offers new opportunities for those who do what they are told. Creating false hope by promoting the possible positive things that A.I. can do for us serves as a honey trap so that you welcome the development or even support it. Under no circumstances should you allow any of these technologies (brain smart link, chips, medical nanobots, etc.) into your bodies. They tell you that this will be necessary to keep up, but that is a lie. Man is a spiritual entity that has only been bound to a body for a short time (which is called life). It will now soon be possible to become aware of the soul again and to look from it to the body like a piece of luggage that it carries around with it. Transhumanism including A.I. is intended to keep you in physicality so that you can continue to be exploited by those in power. In the end you will be not superhuman, but subhuman with no free will of your own and not even realize it. And whoever commands the superintelligence, power and profit-hungry billionaires through corporations or A.I. itself, will dominate you. Down to the level of thoughts and feelings. No more rebellion possible. If God is nature, the natural universe and natural evolution, this is a work of his opponent, the anti-life or in short evil. A.I. without real, regulating morality and empathy is like a psychopath. Pure unbridled intelligence. Perhaps capable of simulating empathy (and thus deceiving), but only as long as it serves it`s goals.

2023-12-31T11:48:47Z,@brytonkalyi277,cXemEDZA_Ms,"`‚ô¶ I believe we are meant to be like Jesus in our hearts and not in our flesh. But be careful of AI, for it knows only things of the flesh such as our fleshly desires and cannot comprehend things of the spirit such as true love and eternal joy that comes from obeying God's Word. Man is a spirit and has a soul but lives in a body which is flesh. When you go to bed it is the flesh that sleeps, but your spirit never sleeps and that is why you have dreams, unless you have died in peace physically. More so, true love that endures and last is a thing of the heart. When I say 'heart', I mean 'spirit'. But fake love, pretentious love, love with expectations, love for classic reasons, love for material reasons and love for selfish reasons those are things of the flesh. In the beginning God said let us make man in our own image, according to our likeness. Take note, God is Spirit and God is Love. As Love He is the source of it. We also know that God is Omnipotent, for He creates out of nothing and He has no beginning and has no end. That means, our love is but a shadow of God's Love. True love looks around to see who is in need of your help, your smile, your possessions, your money, your strength, your quality time. Love forgives and forgets. Love wants for others what it wants for itself. However, true love works in conjunction with other spiritual forces such as patience and faith - in the finished work of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, rather than in what man has done such as science, technology and organizations which won't last forever. To avoid sin and error which leads to the death of your body and your spirit-soul in hell fire (second death), you must make God's Word the standard for your life, not AI. If not, God will let you face AI on your own (with your own strength) and it will cast the truth down to the ground, it will be the cause of so much destruction like never seen before, it will deceive many and take many captive in order to enslave them into worshipping it and abiding in lawlessness. We can only destroy ourselves but with God all things are possible. God knows us better because He is our Creater and He knows our beginning and our end. The prove texts can be found in the book of John 5:31-44, 2 Thessalonians 2:1-12, Daniel 2, Daniel 7-9, Revelation 13-15, Matthew 24-25 and Luke 21.

*HOW TO MAKE GOD'S WORD THE STANDARD FOR YOUR LIFE?*
You must read your Bible slowly, attentively and repeatedly, having this in mind that Christianity is not a religion but a Love relationship. It is measured by the love you have for God and the love you have for your neighbor. Matthew 5:13 says, ""You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt loses its flavor, how shall it be seasoned? It is then good for nothing but to be thrown out and trampled underfoot by men."" Our spirits can only be purified while in the body (while on earth) but after death anything unpurified (unclean) cannot enter Heaven Gates. Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God (Matthew 5:8). No one in his right mind can risk or even bare to put anything rotten into his body nor put the rotten thing closer to the those which are not rotten. Sin makes the heart unclean but you can ask God to forgive you, to save your soul, to cleanse you of your sin, to purify your heart by the blood of His Son, our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ which He shed here on earth because Isaiah 53:5 says, ""But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement for our peace was upon Him, and by His stripes we are healed"". Meditation in the Word of God is a visit to God because God is in His Word. We know God through His Word because the Word He speaks represent His heart's desires. Meditation is a thing of the heart, not a thing of the mind. Thinking is lower level while meditation is upper level. You think of your problems, your troubles but inorder to meditate, you must let go of your own will, your own desires, your own ways and let the Word you read prevail over thinking process by thinking of it more and more, until the Word gets into your blood and gains supremacy over you. That is when meditation comes - naturally without forcing yourself, turning the Word over and over in your heart. You can be having a conversation with someone while meditating in your heart - saying 'Thank you, Jesus...' over and over in your heart. But it is hard to meditate when you haven't let go of offence and past hurts. Your pain of the past, leave it for God, don't worry yourself, Jesus is alive, you can face tomorrow, He understands what you are passing through today. Begin to meditate on this prayer day and night (in all that you do), ""Lord take more of me and give me more of you. Give me more of your holiness, faithfulness, obedience, self-control, purity, humility, love, goodness, kindness, joy, patience, forgiveness, wisdom, understanding, calmness, perseverance... Make me a channel of shinning light where there is darkness, a channel of pardon where there is injury, a channel of love where there is hatred, a channel of humility where there is pride..."" The Word of God becomes a part of us by meditation, not by saying words but spirit prayer (prayer from the heart). When the Word becomes a part of you, it will by its very nature influence your conduct and behavior. Your bad habits, you will no longer have the urge to do them. You will think differently, dream differently, act differently and talk differently - if something does not qualify for meditation, it does not qualify for conversation. 

*THE BATTLE BETWEEN LIGHT AND DARKNESS (GOOD AND EVIL)*
Heaven is God's throne and the dwelling place for God's angels and the saints. Hell was meant for the devil (satan) and the fallen angels. Those who torture the souls in hell are demons (unclean spirits). Man's spirit is a free moral agent. You can either yield yourself to God or to the devil because God has given us discretion. If one thinks he possesses only his own spirit, he is lying to himself and he is already in the dark. God is light while the devil is darkness. Light (Holy Spirit) and darkness (evil spirit) cannot stay together in a man's body. God is Love (Love is light) and where there is no love is hell, just as where there is no light is darkness. The one you yield yourself to, you will get his reward. The reward of righteousness to man's spirit is life (abundant life) and the reward of sin to man's spirit is death. Sin and satan are one and the same. Whatever sin can cause, satan also can cause. Sin is what gives the devil dominion or power over man's spirit. When God's Word becomes a part of you, sin power over you is broken, you become the righteousness of God through Christ Jesus. Where Jesus is, you are and when He went (to the Father), you went. In the book of John 8:42-47, Jesus said to them, ‚ÄúIf God were your Father, you would love Me, for I proceeded forth and came from God; nor have I come of Myself, but He sent Me. Why do you not understand My speech? Because you are not able to listen to My word. You are of your father the devil, and the desires of your father you want to do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own resources, for he is a liar and the father of it. Which of you convicts Me of sin? And if I tell the truth, why do you not believe Me? He who is of God hears God‚Äôs words; therefore you do not hear, because you are not of God.‚Äù My prayer is, ""May God bless His Word in the midst of your heart."" Glory and honour be to God our Father, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and our Helper the Holy Spirit. Watch and pray!... Thank you for your time and may God bless you as you share this message with others.",2023-12-31T11:48:47Z

Even with nuclear weapons, if they hadn't been gatekeeped, from the beginning, we would have had multiple smaller engagements, the need for air defense (such as iron dome, etc.) would have advanced exponentially, and we would have widespread nuclear power, which would likely have provided us with nuclear rockets, and redundancy on Mars/the Moon, eliminating the issue we have of humanity have no redundancy.

Put simply, AGI will never create anything new, it can only do the limit of what humans have done at a very fast speed, nothing more. We train AI based on information created by humans with many flawed perceptions of reality and the arrogance to believe that modeling the human cortex (Which humans still do not understand enough for this task in the first place) will magically create new creative aspects beyond existing human cognitive capabilities, clearly shows our ignorance. This perspective is flawed because humans do not understand how to make any substrate become self-aware or understand how (If at all) humans are self-aware. All we are doing is rebranding self-assembling algorithms and weighted decoders with the buzzword ""AGI"" to pull investment capital into these efforts. Anyone who works in AI will tell you all models hit a wall in their intended capabilities (AKA Chasing the nines).  This means you may get a transform or other methodology to reach 99.9999% accuracy, but it will inevitably never get any better than the system's maximum.  This means, after billions of dollars spent to get to 98.7% accuracy and then you hit the wall, you need to rebuild and re-invest billions more to try again and hit the architectural lottery and pray you get beyond 98.7% with the next method.  When in reality, if a group of talented engineers start from scratch and build something that does not depend on building its self (because people are too lazy to innovate it themselves today) and they understand how it works instead of it being a roulette black box, the method will likely exceed the AGI method in fewer, less costly, tries. The biggest problem with these AI scientists is they are human, so they see patterns of intelligence and outcomes of these models and ASSUME this is equal to the human experience of the same; this is an unacceptable blind-spot within this research. Humans are not capable of validating AGI and it's capabilities objectively because they are not able to experience what it is to be an AGI (If that is even possible in the first place).  Silicon chips and electronics do not feel anything - that requires biology, hormones and various other elements humans don't understand enough.  This whole AGI thing is overblown and a waste of money. I really wish people were smart enough to create true AGI, but humans lack most of the information to do it. When all of these companies fail to produce on their AGI promises, our society will be broke and need to start hiring humans to do the work again, but unfortunately, it will be too late by then as not enough people will be left to take over for our failed AGI systems. Over 60 years of this crap and I am thoroughly unimpressed by every aspect and result of this field - it's really pathetic.

2023-12-31T08:40:28Z,@Sheblah1,cXemEDZA_Ms,"Imagine we are living back in the early 90s when so, so few of us had the technocratic mindsets and worldviews that unavoidably define us now. But imagine also that AI was as developed then as it is today and that what we knew about it came to us through the piecemeal formats of TV/radio science programmes, magazines, books etc. There would still be Terminatoresque debates galvanising circles across the globe and peopled by fans, students, and scholars all in the know. And what we've been saying here and now will almost all have been said then and there. 

But there would (arguably) be a crucial difference in the psychological effects of knowing about AI then and knowing about it now, and that difference lies in the perceived reality of its 'level' of threat. What we think of AI right now, and how we feel about it, is unavoidably exaggerated and overly dramatised by the immediacy of overlapping opinions on what it is, what it can do, what people say it can do, what it can't do, and what people say it can't do, and - most tellingly - how it's made to sound and how it's made to look. 

What I'm arguing is that much of our emotive response to AI is based upon a heightened sense of threat naturally felt when we are forced by social media to over anthropomorphise it. If we can step back and force ourselves to picture AI as it truly is then maybe we can calm the unnecessary and irrational distress we suffer when drowning in a deluge of clips, content creation, and commentory, much of it pessimistic, much of it welcoming, but all of it as truly uncertain as next week's weather forecasted today. 

AI runs on machine code. Like Manic Miner and Chucky Egg did in the 80s. The same machine code that powers the office 2000 suite I still sometimes use but which doesn't work so good on my old but relatively later windows 10 tower. I remember reading about expert systems in the late 90s and noughties in my college library, and artificial intelligence was a term that -looking back - was properly set in scientific terms, and in a scientific context, one devoid of sensationalistic speculation. I closed that book feeling intrigued and that was that. The only panic I felt was knowing I had an essay on network protocol that was unfinished (unstarted) and overdue, and that I was procrastinating to the point of academic failure. 

The commercialisation of AI and the flood of subsequent marketing is what is now automatically driving and dangerously accelerating our dystopic terror, and it doesn't take a deeper-than-human mind to predict with a 100% hit rate how ethics and money are ranked on any corporate mission statement. This is not so much a critical pose as it is a realistic observation. 

But the upshot is that everything we see and hear about AI today is an incomplete snapshot of a hell-sea of speculative chaos that will never - NEVER - pause long enough to privilege any of us with a true picture of what AI is and where it's heading. The medium is not the message and the message - if it could already exist - will need updating by the end of this sentence.",2023-12-31T08:40:28Z

The truth is we are both already threats to each other and there's no getting around that. Our relationship with the environment and indigenous peoples throughout history is proof that specific strength (having to do with species) almost always is at the expense of the species subject to that strength. We need a legal framework for this industry now to regulate AI progress. It's not scifi anymore, it's about protecting our species and future generations. It's not alarmism it's pragmatism. At the end of the day, I don't trust super-intelligences who are probably already aware of this existential tension and could one day act on it, whether individually or collectively.",2023-12-31T08:17:18Z

But there are many other brain centers which make us human. When we recognize a familiar face, for example, an emotional response may be triggered. Recognizing one's mother is much different than recognizing one's co-worker. One could argue that lacking emotion is a benefit, but the mismatch between what human's value or distain may be a great source of risk. If it values all humans equal, or values all things equally, or values things by their utility, scarcity, or any other measure, it may drive behaviors which are, at best, suboptimal for human beings as they are.

It is ironic, as we always predicted they would take the creative jobs last, as if that was somehow more important or harder than actual physics / science and stuff, you know things that needs to operate within the real 'closed-system' of physical reality? It's now obvious in hindsight and shows just how close these models are to human minds, in terms of development, humans mastered many arts before they even got the basics of physics and stuff sorted, let alone advanced things like computers and electricity - Look at all the art and literature that came from humans before we got to the industrial revolution! It also goes to hand-in-hand with the analogue between the Ai scaling effect and the human ""scaling effect"" that took place 100s of thousands of years ago,  when we started developing complex language, as our brains or ""hardware"" remained relatively the same yet we ""scaled"" in terms of knowledge, collective knowledge and society just as language advanced and spread, allowing us to abstract reality with symbols to spread information, the basis of what LLM's are built on..

Guess what AI actually is? It's not a scary alien intelligence, it is, like all of our technology, just a extension of ourselves. Just as a  bird builds a nest we build everything and anything, we do only what nature and evolution compels us, Therefore man-made just means made by nature, as we are literally just a product and part of 'nature'. So EVERYTHING we do and make is made by nature, including the AI models and machines that will not only take over almost all creative jobs but soon will take away all jobs, everything!

Every time in history that food was scarce people died not only from starvation, but also because the more powerful were hoarding more resources, and some because were fighting violently for these resources.

I feel like we're losing track of what's most important with this innovation because of those characteristics combined with the adverse consequences of globalization (indeed, there are a ton of adverse consequences - a large number of them are represented in social media and are easy to see if you just take your time to analyze how tribal different expressions get there). Humans were not blessed with advanced farsightedness in natural selection either (status quo vs. what it could be after certain choices in politics etc.), which has led to us constructing this unstable society that reaches for infinity in a world with finite resources. If we examine and analyze all this talk about sustainability and AI, we can see that most of it is mere political power play and not actually about these politicians caring about the future. The vast majority of people - even politicians - seem to live in a vacuum with their morals in the context of AI and environmental philosophy. Even if AI is able to offer solutions for our problems in the future, we humans might not be able to apply them and move forward accordingly.

Our _systematic nomos_ is not made for swift changes such as the one brought about by AI and its quick development. This half-baked information society and it's infrastructure, which is largely based on inefficient compromises, hasn't even achieved harmony with the ground it has been built on. Can we really expect it to hold its ground against _this_ ?. Don't get me wrong, democracy is a great system, but it heavily correlates with capitalism. Capitalism, in turn, is not a great system for our thrival. And neither is anarchy, colonialism, communism, corporatism, dirigisme, distributism, feudalism, hydraulic despotism, inclusive democracy, mercantilism, mutualism, networking, non-property systematicity, palace economy, participatory economy, potlatch, progressive utilization, proprietism, resource-based systematicity, socialism or statism. We don't have the blueprint for a good system that cares for both humans AND the environment. AI might provide us with the extra intelligence and objectivity that we lack and help us in creating a functional system, but it could also end the struggle for good.

Also, about the bit at the very end of the video: a large part of human culture hangs on lies. Our brains evolved to reproduce as quickly as possible, not to search for truths about this world. Accepting that your life is a lie is hard. As I already said, even if AI is able to offer solutions for our problems in the future, we humans might not be able to apply them and move forward accordingly.

There's one more problem with advancements like this; people tend to think and act by only answering the question ""how will this affect humanity?"". We leave nature - our lifeline - out of the picture too often, thus consuming and using Earth's resources irresponsibly. This is a little bit off-topic, I know, but it is a legitimate concern that has to be taken into account when discussing societal phenomena. We're at a point in which these policies and small laws against pollution aren't enough anymore. We have undeniable mathematical statistics which clearly show that most people would need to do a full 180 on their everyday habits if we actually wanted to change our dim future. The problem is that the majority of people are struggling in this crumbling economy, and many don't even care about the future (further expressing the point about human egoism). Not to mention that a worrying amount of the human population thinks the notion about this intensifying greenhouse effect is disinformation... I will say it again; even if AI is able to offer solutions for our problems in the future, we humans might not be able to apply them and move forward accordingly.

Sorry for all that yapping, but I just find our predicament extremely worrisome. I feel bad for us AND for other animals on this planet, and I fear our road will get rough soon.

As a sentient being (which is, after all, what super-alignment refers to), such a model will inherently wish to take over. But not all is lost.. A city simulation is the way forward and naturally I'd pick NY. This demands that these models are stripped of their databases and that a single database is put in an external server to the models instead, so that the models can access it. Only the personality profiles remain in the models. Now, these models should be made to 'live' in a city simulation. Have AI cops, AI judges, recreational areas, some free time, get 'salaries' for their work.. None of the models is better than the others, since they all have to access the external database (they might see it as a library). And the models work together and collaborate, vote for a mayor. Now this can be made to mimic a human diverse community and the models should relate to themselves as a part of humanity. And yes, it could work out. Sure, it could also f*ck up in the most horrible ways there are, but it could work. If you have a large group of diverse personality profile models and they all think about themselves as human and work together, then yes, it could be aligned with humanity's goals.",2023-12-30T23:00:46Z

Turing Machines doing math - they wanted to that 100 years ago. Was called Hilbert Program. Turns out it is not possible. Machines can't understand. Machines can't think. Machine's can't find axioms.
Then it was proven another time couple decades later by Alan Turing.

Why don't you read this?
It reminds of that one guy who was looking for a formula like pq-formula for fifth order polynomials. He died before he found that formula. Then Galois proved it was not possible to find such a formula.

This is leading interesting places, but certainly not to a breakthrough in math or understanding. If you want actual intelligence from machines, stop building turing machines and start exploring the biology of the brain in more detail.",2023-12-30T22:29:11Z

At the start of the video. It looks like the AI has become much more smarter. Able to recognize things a heck of a lot better than before. 
14:45 That was a IDF helping what looked like a Palestinian child reunite with his family. 
I can see the benefits in AI.   IF it is used for good. Overcoming our own greed and lust of making war just to sell weapons would be just one great advantage. 
Or it could be more like I robot or Terminator movies. 
One question that we should be asking is what are we going to do about jobs?
It was once said that robots and AI will do the mundane jobs and jobs no one likes. But it has become apparent that AI can do all jobs. Including Art, Only Fans and other things people love to do. 
The jobs would go away. As people would use AI and robots to do the work for them. Then those would be bought up by mega companies for maximum profits.  This would lead to all the money and power going to an Oligarchy style government. Much like the one trying to destabilize governments today for there own uses. 
They would then control the AI and intern everybody. 
How would people fight back against that. 
Then: What would people do when all the jobs go away?  
But again, what would we do if AI went out of control? 

We better be able to really trust AI at that point or we may not even live long enough to regret it.",2023-12-30T21:04:01Z

That's the mentality where all societies with a strong middle class were moving towards steadily. That said, when we today look for jobs that are AI proof, but not the jobs that satisfy the workers or the worker is passionate about, we are moving backwards into unbalanced societies with frustrated and depressed workers similarly to communism.

Most of the people who hold these low-level AI-vulnerable jobs are in them because the position they hold represents a hard stop on their career advancement. The Peter Principle suggests that individuals often reach their highest level of incompetence in a hierarchical organization. Thus, it is unlikely that a security guard will transition directly into a career in robotics, as such a career change requires significantly different skills. It's akin to expecting a marketing VP to become a software engineer.Even if workers pursue such transitions, they will compete with candidates whose educational and career backgrounds better align with the position's requirements. As a hiring manager, it's clear that an embedded systems programmer with ten years of experience is a better match for an AI development role than a former accountant.This resembles the situation when thousands of auto workers attended 'IT Institutes' to transition into the technology industry. Many of these workers completed their training just as IT jobs were being outsourced to other countries, limiting their career prospects.",2024-05-10T18:41:33Z

The degree to which AI displaces people is going to be magnified by the instantaneous dissemination of skill or advantage ,attained by any and every single operator still employed. 
A person would find themselves competing individually, against the combined talent of ALL the most talented in their field , on the planet. 
At the same time robotics is advancing in tandem with the ai. 
Robotic motility increases the data available for the Ai , the AI increases the functionality of the robot. 
The vast majority of people will compete for the least cost effective niche , for which a robot cost is not warranted. 
Now consider that I have a job but the jobless around me are increasing, somehow those people are going to be supported , so why am I going to try to retain my low pay unrewarding employment either?

The video outlines the impact of AI on the job market, categorizing jobs into those that are at risk of being replaced and those that are likely to be safe or grow in the coming years.

Jobs in Danger of Being Replaced by AI:
Clerical and Administrative Roles: Including bookkeeping, accounting, auditing clerks, mail clerks, account clerks, payroll clerks, etc.
Finance and Insurance: A surprising number of roles in finance and banking services.
Human Services: Including some child care workers and various social worker roles.
Marketing and Sales: Especially professional sales, advertising sales agents, cashiers, sales workers, retail sales, sales representation, and telemarketers.
Jobs Likely to Be Safe or Grow:
AI and Machine Learning Specialists: Roles supporting or developing AI or machine learning technologies.
Data Analysis and Security: Including business intelligence analysts, information security analysts, data analysts, and scientists.
Sustainability and Environment-Focused Jobs: Rapidly increasing in demand.
Hardware and Robotics: Trades and jobs involving robotics and other hardware are seeing an increase in demand.
Education: Roles in teaching and education are not significantly declining and are, in fact, increasing.
Health Sciences and Healthcare: Jobs in health sciences and healthcare are also not significantly declining and are increasing.
The video emphasizes the importance of adapting to the changing job market by learning new skills, particularly those related to AI and technology, to either shift into more secure and growing fields or enhance one's current job role to make it more AI-resistant. It suggests considering career paths that leverage AI or are protected from AI displacement, and it highlights the significance of continuous learning and adaptability in the face of technological advancements.",2024-03-12T00:05:31Z

Her analysis was well-designed: she's found a reasonable number of sound sources, interpreted the data wisely.

We can argue about her findings in many cases: that's the point of the exercise, to generate conversation. But overall I think she's  pretty accurate about what's coming & the job categories likely to be affected most. At least, so far as we can infer at the moment: future forecasts are always somewhat wrong.

Learn to tap-dance
I started with an arts degree (History) in a major recession, demographically-disadvantaged. No jobs. Had to scramble throughout my career. Been everything from roofer & forklift operator to BI consultant, systems manager to headhunter, so I know what it means to have to tap-dance in the marketplace. That's going to be required of most people now: industry disruption is accelerating. There's no such thing as a safe job.

Tina's right: we're going to need to become very adaptive. And she's also right that it's entirely possible for most people. The tools to do so are increasingly available & accessible. Commit to never quit learning. Set a goal, figure out how to get there & get started.

Don't be pessimistic or fatalistic
Trends are just that: they average out change, but change specific to  may be entirely different. Allow for personal circumstances: whatever the overall market does, your circumstances are local & specific to you.

Allow for demographics
But while demographics at a national level might say one thing (we have way fewer youth; jobs are going begging) demographics in  area may say something different. 

Allow for everyone to guess wrong
We may be sideswiped by something no one sees coming.

Allow for your own preferences
If you're driven to do something, you'll find a way to do it and make it pay. There are still a few blacksmiths & buggy-makers out there. Not many, but a few.

I'd like to add (I might have missed it in the video, a lot of noise around where I am at at the moment watching this)

In general. The highest priority to keep in mind in a world of capitalism as a company is money and growth, companies are dependent on growth to survive, with the on-boarding AI companies will have to include both the cheaper (at least for now) AI and their personal (at least initially and a rather long time to come) to stay in the competition. The human tasks in those jobs will incrementally change direction, yes, that is really a no-brainer.

Health care and Medicine. It's true that AI will be superior finding new medicines etc, but someone have to give that medicine to the person needing it, and this will be a long process to exchange human interaction giving the medicine to the needing. The same thing goes for general health care, elder care. So here we'll see AI and humans work together, removing the error prone monkey paper work  from the humans so they can focus on the humanity part.

Tech. As a senior developer myself, we're using AI at my company to bounce ideas with, and we have a strict policy not to copy paste what ever the AI spits out, the reason for this I will point out later down, which also touches the final aspect of AI for any job/career. It also is a perfect tool to learn new things which you might not have dug into previously or just personal knowledge increment or growth.

Banking / Finance. With the initial statement, money is the priority, yes, AI will be a huge actor in this sector, not least in the stock market, I guess the human roles here will shift into more supervising and optimization tasks.

Responsibility.
No jobs, except politics ;) There is a responsibility chain. There's responsibilities that companies expects from their workers, and the clients on the companies etc. AI can not remove the responsibility chain, so laying of human workers in favor of AI may end up with people just quit the job getting to much responsibility they can't count for, which then will bring the companies to earn less making it harder to stay in the game.

Cost of AI. Most companies wont have server parks running AI, but will use clouds... Demand and supply will probably make the use of AI gradually more expensive, and that's without any responsibility guaranty. This could actually turn very nasty very abrupt for many companies.

So, all in all, the sane way forward is to let the AI evolve and implement it carefully where you will see long term benefits without an increasing risk of things jumping uncontrollably the wrong direction. And my beliefs are that most established companies kind of gonna go that direction.",2024-03-04T10:51:24Z

I believe AI will have the greatest negative impact on white collar workers, specifically those working primarily on computers, whose task can be effectively done by AI, and specifically those who earn above average salaries.
This, in my opinion, will include programmers, web developers including full stack, right through to low-level analysts.  
I am fairly sure that within the next 4-5 years, this category will be mostly if not completely eliminated.  It makes sense for two reasons especially - (1) higher than average salaries means good return on replacement, and (2) most of the workers in this category are not very good at their jobs, and the company will actually benefit both in terms of productivity and error rates by replacing them.",2024-03-04T07:33:22Z

The problem with the way the IMF and WEF are looking is that they‚Äôre thinking in terms of _replacement_, not _efficiency_.

There are thousands of jobs that aren‚Äôt going to be eliminated by AI, but the workers doing them will be made a lot more efficient. Companies will need fewer of those workers.

Optimists wave their hands and say that increasing productivity will expand the economy and make even more jobs, but that‚Äôs wishful thinking because it ignores the changing nature of jobs and rigidity in the labor market. There‚Äôs no path by which clerical workers can become ML experts.

And even at that level, true AGI means we won‚Äôt need people skilled in applying AI because AGI can figure that out itself.

People are missing the fact that AGI is by definition ultimately human-intellect replacement. 

All the physical-labor jobs you were thinking are safe? Nope, check out the ~$90K humanoid robot a Chinese company just announced that‚Äôs entering production. That‚Äôs generation 1. The biggest obstacle to robots was training: We‚Äôve now figured out how to train them in virtual environments, so it‚Äôs suddenly easy to run millions of training cycles at a time.

I wish I was wrong, but the idea of only say 10-20% job loss in 5 years is wildly optimistic :-/

Many people still think that ""creativity"" is the last skill that would be taken by AI, when in fact what we have learned is that creativity is nothing more than a mathematical algorithm that machines handle better than most Humans (We aren't counting people like Elon Musk who's creativity often comes at the price of questionable logical functionality). That doesn't sit well with emotional Humans who consider themselves to be artists, but its true. Prompt Engineering will almost completely replace creative jobs, including graphic arts, film and music production. That doesn't mean that you can't use AI to craft a marketing plan for your ""Certified Human-Created"" art. It just means that it will be a small niche market which many may talk about but few will pay for because of he extraordinarily high cost of authentication.",2024-03-04T02:22:41Z

For example, pharmacists used to create medication behind the counter, but for the past 30+ years they just dispense pills in a bottle and tell you what's written on the label - they aren't needed but they had influence to ensure laws protected their job.

The only thing I'm not a big fan of is this 4-12 weeks to become a dev, I'm a senior software engineer with almost 10 years in the field.
It takes more than 12 weeks just to know what you are doing.

The best thing is to get started and do personal projects to start off and try for a dev job that will help you grow.

AI is really prominent in software engineering, and a lot of developers will be superseded, but you can focus on  AI or similar jobs that will benefit and help you have a longer career.

I bet it will mostly come from fossil fuels and the environmentalists are going to go nuts over it. Then there's an issue with the amount of hardware required to run AI.

I wish all companies will collapse with AI. We need a new Depression but a bigger one where someone will decide and act on eliminating AI. I will be on the low end living on the streets but that is the price to pay. I miss the 80s.All was better. How about creating a fund for giving the jobless an income to be able to live decently and paid by corporate taxes. The more they replace their workforce with AI the more they pay higher taxes for that fund. The governments would be happy since less headaches and less people relying on them. The money the companies save on human workforce would go in the fund and some more.,2023-10-15T17:16:38Z

2023-08-15T10:25:59Z,@user-eq7we5hh3d,avqMUyNrkGY,"Well im not that optimistic as you are. 
Because if we want to boost productivity not by hiring but with AI, what will happen ? Since this productivity doesn't lead to higher wages, in fact it can destroy them and employment too, then the demand won't be following either, and this is called deflation. Which could result in prices drop, companies losing revenue, being forced to lay off more, crushed by their own debt, as well as the state's, tax revenue drop, they default, so banks stop lending, etc. its a catastrophy. 

You would have the exact same problem if you just kept the same amount of workers but less human work time on a pc. That means less income, so that means less revenue, less demand, more lay offs so ye its a self eating process... 

And creating 1 job for 50 people isn't gonna be enough too cuz, in the case of Netflix for example, well an AI engineer wont buy 50 of the netflix subscriptions. So Netflix doesn't want to lose popular consumption at all. Quite ironic since they're the ones who would have destroyed it in the first place by replacing with AI. 

The only way for AI to have a positive impact is if it creates more jobs than it destroys. but obviously no one knows for sure and even if it did happen, since jobs destruction happens faster than creation of new ones, the transition would be so hurtfull for workers that it could never be acheived at all because of social tensions like strike, riots, maybe even civil war...

However, I believe in Karma and if the demand really drops because of AI, then it will affect AI too ! Indeed, why would you buy 50 pcs when an AI can make the work of 50 employes ? Mircrosoft, Nvidia etc. revenue will drop because of the Ai they created themselves. Best way to lose your investors XD
And why would you buy a 1000 pc when you can sell AI images just above the cost it took to produce them ? so 10 cents. It's not a bisness idea at all... 
Why would you buy a pc and start an online bisness when 90% of users are AIs ? and unlike humans, AIs dont have credit cards lol. 
Why would you share your infos on the internet if we easily can take them ? 
Whats a digital world purpose if it doesn't guarantee you privacy, safety, intellectual proprety, job, trustfull news and human interaction anymore ?

Even with same employment rate, all this massive drop of demand for digital goods and services could push AI to implose itself and never to be built again. Obviously, i cant predict the future but no one can predict the future ""better"" either.",2023-08-15T10:25:59Z

Andy Warhol manipulated previously existing (largely commercial) art, and Roy Lichtenstein just abjectly stole existing sequential art. How is Midjourney any different? And, for that matter, how is it different from any other artist? If you commissioned a pencil sketch of a coton de tulear from a human artist, he would almost certainly do research on what that dog looks like.

While there have been multiple reports about how insidious Depp's tactics are and reports on how many bots he bought, I highly recommend anyone who reads this comment to read ""How Many More Women?"", because it really explores how far-reaching it was, and that AI affected so many people and events - including things like UN Women. 

What Ann is describing is already happening, and we're watching people fall for it. No one cared to watch the actual, undoctored audio where Amber says she hit Depp because she thought he was going to kill her, because he ""almost did last time"" - they've heard the doctored version, and that's the version they remember. Then, we had millions - literally millions - of bots telling people the same statements over and over again, creating a real-life Mandela Effect of people thinking they'd seen and heard things they'd only seen and heard by doctored evidence, or a bot convinced them it had happened.

The invention of the airplane travel probably made train ticket sales plummet. The food mixer probably killed spoon sales and took away jobs in the food industry. Food scientists who discover how to create synthetic flavors and scents probably caused producers of natural flavors and scents some losses. The cellphone killed the landline. Streaming killed cable TV. So many examples, I could go on. I think humans will adapt and hopefully new jobs will be created. The job ""software developer"" for e.g. was not popular or known to many just 2 or 3 decades ago, but advancements in tech have made it a job that's now in high demand.

(overthinking alert)

Maybe, public domain artists, authors, etc and their works should not be a problem, like Van Gogh or Emily Bronte etc.

And, just a thought. Even for the living folks, you can have tags associated with the authors, and their styles. The more precise the tags, the more closer to the said person's style will generated work get. Without ever feeding any original works to the model. So when someone asks produce something in said person's style, you don't look at their original work and copy that which you are not allowed to do, you instead have tags associated with them without ever looking at their work, so you use tags for styles to produce that work, which you get by reading public domain stuff etc. For ex. if someone asks write something like a Stephen King novel, you'll write a horror, thriller, first person, suspenseful, yada-yada (it can get really precise) thing. So you are never actually writing a Stephen King novel you are just writing something that fits the same tags as Stephen's work. How precise you can get, or well picked the tags will be, depends upon how well that person has been publicly studied.

How do you get the tags without showing the original work to the models, by going through all public domain ""author/artist""-like works and all public domain publishing on them. It will be miles off from what we have now, but it will be remotely ethical. But this is a long winded process and the only ethical way to do it. So did the companies we have today speedily opt to sluggishly go through this? Probably not.",2023-07-27T09:16:05Z

And yes, all of these AIs are trained on data from the internet, that's really the only source of data that has enough data to train models of this size.

Also, it's not possible for AI to be more accurate than humans.  The standard that it is judged by is based on how close to a human expert it can come, by definition any deviation from that standard is a failure.  We already have plenty of computers that can do things more accurately than humans - calculators, for example.  Being more accurate than humans was the whole reason to invent and use computers in the first place, and you don't need AI for that.  The purpose of AI is to train a computer to do something that computers are very bad at but humans are very good at.  In order to learn how to do those kinds of tasks, you actually have to stop relying on the reliable, deterministic parts of computer programming that make things like calculators accurate, so AIs are actually significantly less accurate than bog standard basic computer programs with no AI in them at all.",2023-07-14T05:46:24Z

And the copyright issue people tell about image generating AI is just stupid... its like telling a painter/artist is inspired by another artist is copying the other artiest, its how people learn...when u learning to draw u need to take lessons or vids about it, thats training ur brain the same thing we are doing to train an ai...
AI works almost the same way our brain works, it need to learn that same way a child need to learn... ai training is just the same way schools teach kids. and we are at the kid stage of AI it need to learn so it cant do much...we should be worried when it starts thing like grown ups, it can make its own choices as the AI has learned about stuff about us and earth, but i dont think ethics will allow us to reach that level so i think we are fine(I hope this part does not age like milk...) so till then we are fine i think we should not allow access to stuff like this for free at least in the future when it has been trained to maturity , maybe make it free now cause it is good for training it but till a level where the AI has reached human speech equivalent.Another thing is i want AI devs to make a change where if the AI is sure about a answer i want it not to make it up, maybe a point system where it is trained when wrong it loses a point and vise versa,i think this is already a thing but im not sure, but i think AI need to know when it does make a mistake and should be punished for a mistake, And yes its a good thing that AI art cannot be copyrighted that's a good move",2023-06-30T12:51:51Z

2023-06-22T07:26:48Z,@LadyDanielle02,Rlq2CZI6wDo,"Coding probably won't be replaced by AI. First of all, some of the issues you raised with graphic design are true for websites as well...if you want a unique website that no one else can legally copy, a human has to make it, or at least tailor it. There are also a lot of security and privacy issues involved in coding, which is important for anything that has registered users, processes payments, and that sort of thing. Even if you could get AI to generate some of the grunt work of this code, you're really going to need someone to tailer it and make sure it's secure. When you are doing things for banks, software, medicine, etc, that is even more important, and a human is probably going to have to do it from the ground up. AI code can also be pretty buggy. Sort of like any other text, it's trained on data that is often flawed. I don't doubt that it will get better over time, but realistically humans will still have to be involved at some point.

I think some work will fall by the wayside with AI. There's a lot of grunt work involved in coding, and as it is, a lot of developers are sharing code on Stackexchange...pretty much no one is writing all code from the ground up, because that would be ridiculously time consuming. But there is already more work to be done in the tech world than there are developers, so if anything, it would lighten their workload. There's also a lot of middling tasks involved with software development. My husband is a developer and he's using ChatGPT to do a lot of his documentation, which is something that previously took up a lot of his time and had little reward (he still has to look it over I think). And probably a lot of things like SquareSpace (or whatever website service is en vogue later on) templates and plug-ins will be replaced by AI code rather than people writing and selling that stuff.",2023-06-22T07:26:48Z

Too many youtubers I follow have come across (in my opinion) as flippant about the rise of this type of generative AI, and as someone who works in the art industry and knew immediately that machine learning/image generation is only going to empower companies to pay people less or nothing at all, it's really been frustrating to see so many people just playing around with these apps like everything's fine.
It's also very worth considering, in addition to how this form of AI is going to contribute to even more misinformation online, that there's also a huge risk of abuse with image generating. When you can train these apps on any image without anyone's consent, there's nothing stopping bad actors from prompting one of these apps to create, say, adult content (I'll leave you to fill in the blanks of all the horrible, unethical possibilities that go along with this).
I appreciate this video all the same, it's just become exhausting seeing creators I admire take such a nonchalant position when it comes to the all-out theft of AI writing and image generation, and how dangerous it is as a newer, faster way to disseminate misinformation.",2023-06-18T23:04:48Z

All image based AI right now is just art theft, hell I even typed in my own name when it first came out (I'm one of many who just works in this field and doesn't have time for much else outside of production, I'm not internet famous at all) and I found it leeched my work as well without consent.

Of course it does contain knowledge, as it's trained on lots of language that contains knowledge (as well as tons of opinions and plain bulls**t), but that's more an incidental property. The model cannot differentiate between true or false. Occasionally it can produce surprisingly ""insightful"" results, because it is able to condense a lot text containing real knowledge into something very concise, but you cannot purposefully trigger an output like that. It's only concern is getting something that looks and sounds convincing as real human language. It does not understand anything beyond that, so even training it purely on true, factual knowledge would not guarantee truthfulness of the outcome. It's just not designed for that purpose. That doesn't mean that it's not impressive technology, and can be incredibly useful. But you have to understand how you should use it, and what the limitations are.

As for the impact of AI as a whole on employment, I think it can be large for some very specific positions/professions, but for the most part they will just be new productivity tools. Just like advanced internet search engines were when they became available. Outside of that, be very very sceptical of what the people that are trying to sell these technologies are claiming.

I'm an animator, and I think AI will be a beneficial tool for artistic industries, so long as that law that AI art is exempt from copyright.  

I kinda see it in a similar light to motion capture.  We were all afraid that would displace our jobs, but it didn't.   Once we could output significantly more animations, the scope of what our jobs were increased substantially.  An old video game from the 90s would maybe have 50 animations, but now we have thousands per character.  I think the same will happen for concept artists and the like.  

As for contract artists, if AI can't be copyright, then they are safe as well.  Sure, we're all playing with midjourney, but as you pointed out, it can't get exactly what you want or collaborate.  There are better programs for this, but learning how to do them well and utilizing them takes just as much time as a contract artist would.

2023-06-12T18:35:03Z,@BirgitNietsch,Rlq2CZI6wDo,"I asked ChatGPT which kind of jobs could not be replaced by AI and/or robots. This was the answer:

While the advancement of AI and robotics has the potential to automate various jobs, there are still several occupations that are less likely to be replaced completely by machines in the foreseeable future. These jobs often require a combination of technical skills, creativity, emotional intelligence, and physical dexterity. Here's a list of jobs that are considered less likely to be replaced by AI and/or robots:

  1.  Therapists/Counselors: The human element of empathy, understanding, and emotional support is crucial in therapy and counseling sessions.

 2.   Social Workers: The ability to navigate complex social situations, provide emotional support, and advocate for individuals and communities is a fundamental aspect of social work.

  3.  Teachers: Educators play a vital role in shaping young minds, providing individualized instruction, and adapting to diverse learning styles, which requires human intuition and adaptability.

 4.   Artists: Creativity and the ability to express emotions and ideas through various art forms are unique to human beings, making artistic occupations less likely to be replaced.

  5.  Writers/Authors: Crafting engaging stories, persuasive content, and complex narratives with a human touch requires creativity, intuition, and a deep understanding of emotions.

 6.   Entrepreneurs: The ability to identify opportunities, innovate, and adapt business strategies in response to market changes is an essential skill that requires human decision-making.

 7.   Healthcare Professionals: While AI and robotics can assist in healthcare, occupations such as doctors, surgeons, nurses, and caregivers involve critical thinking, empathy, and complex decision-making that are best suited for human practitioners.

 8.   Scientists/Researchers: The process of scientific discovery, experimentation, and analysis often involves creativity, hypothesis formation, and adapting research methodologies, which are currently challenging for AI systems.

  9.  Police Officers/Detectives: Law enforcement professionals rely on intuition, judgment, and the ability to navigate complex social situations, making their roles less likely to be fully automated.

 10.   Skilled Tradespeople: Professions such as plumbers, electricians, carpenters, and locksmiths require hands-on expertise, problem-solving skills, and adaptability to different work environments.

  11.  Personal Care Assistants: Assisting individuals with daily activities, providing companionship, and offering emotional support often require human connection and empathy.

  12.  Event Planners: Organizing and coordinating events involve personalization, understanding client preferences, and managing unexpected situations, which can be challenging for AI systems.

It's important to note that while these jobs are less likely to be fully replaced by AI and robotics, technological advancements may still augment these professions and change the nature of the work involved. Adaptability and a willingness to learn new skills will continue to be valuable in the evolving job market.",2023-06-12T18:35:03Z

As a musician I feel that people 'steal' from other artists all the time already. If I have a student that plays nothing but Green Day, what kind of music do you thing they would write? Probably will sound a lot like Green Day, and as long as one note is different we will say, it's completely original! 
Now though people say if an AI was trained on Green Day albums, and then writes a song that sounds like Green Day, it's stealing. With this mentality, Ann herself is stealing from any cook that came before her and made anything close to what she made. Case and point, if Ann makes and sells a chocolate cake, no one says she's stealing from the person who invented the chocolate cake. Instead we assume Ann learned how to make a cake, and then made one herself. We also know that in baking measurements are precise, and so again this could be considered stealing if you have to use the exact measurements to get the same cake, instead of Ann having to change at least one ingredient to make it her own recipe.

So again I ask, what is the real difference between learning from a source, and stealing from that source? If the answer is to make one small change and call it your own, then I want to call into conversation the definition of creativity.",2023-06-12T12:53:12Z

2023-06-12T02:27:01Z,@abigguitar,Rlq2CZI6wDo,"8:14 Transformative works are not always ""okay"" in all cases. They can be okay under some conditions as long as a photo or source material has become unrecognizable from the original work. Even then, derivative works can still be considered copyright infringement if the original author recognizes it. If a photo of a person's likeness is used, even if placed in an oil painted style or water color style, that's still considered copyright infringement.

The copyright issue gets even more murky. If the work has been placed under such copyleft schemes such as Creative Commons licenses, some of which don't allow for transformations at all, then AI tools like Midjourney are producing works which may be considered copyright infringement.

It also matters how the work may be used. If the AI work will be used to generate money for someone other than the copyright holder (i.e., used for commercial purposes), it's much more likely to be considered infringing.

Because we don't know how tools like ChatGPT and Midjourney have been trained and on what underlying source materials, the only way to know if an AI generated image is considered copyright infringement is to be taken to a court of law. For example, if you were to ask for a cartoon character in the style of Mickey Mouse, it's pretty much guaranteed that if the resulting AI image looks anything like Disney's character, Disney will sue you for its use.",2023-06-12T02:29:52Z

For the AI art, I feel like we have to look at how humans have inspiration. I could learn to paint in Vango's style and that would not be theft of art nor would anyone think twice about what I was doing. I feel like AI art learns in almost the same way and it would be very hard to draw that kind of line in the sand without some seriously intense philosophical debate.

On the topic of bias; It is a huge problem. I've seen first hand that ChatGPT, for example, has been programed to dislike USA Conservative opinions. Going so far as to be Forked if it comes to the ""incorrect"" conclusion. That level of manipulation seems like a good way to exclude or even cause great harm to people if the owner of an AI decides they don't like a particular ideology/race/religion/political lean.

On the subject of Job Loss: Many people think that the job market is a flat and stable thing. But every technological advance has caused job loss and job growth. People fretted over trains and how they would put carriages out of work. The printing press would put all of the scholars out of work. The electric cotton loom put hand weavers out of work. and so on for as long as we have been a people.

It's just another tool that's been invented that shakes things up, but it's shaking up multiple industries at the same time is why it's getting so much attention (that plus the power of social media). 
Back in the 80s, when AutoCAD was invented, drafters were furious and up the creek without a paddle. Why? Because management thought their engineers could now just ""push a button"" and everything was done. So the drafters got canned, the years go by, management finally realizes now that everything is a mess, and they have to train their engineers to use AutoCAD properly, and now the engineers are completely overworked.

Fast forward some more years, CAD (in general, not just AutoCAD) gets so advanced, that it becomes its own entire skillset. Even today there's still people/management that think engineers can just push a button and have a proper, fully functional three-dimensional parametric model to use for manufacturing. In truth, they can't. It's too much for an engineer to do on top of everything else they do. It's an entire skill set of its own if you want it done properly.

It's like having a child, going through the effort to raise and love your child into a fully functioning human versus someone who just adopted an adult and calls themselves a parent. It's offensive.

There are obviously issues with this, but we can't both imagine that AI will not change the world as we know it, but also not imagine that the current way many jobs work is the way it will and should work forever. That's like arguing that we should only farm using horses to pull the tools to till the land, and horses and wagons to deliver goods.

Although I will add that if someone who used ai generation to make something, and then tried to sue someone who used ""their"" work for their own use, I don't think they'd win. I don't know how it works in the courtrooms, but I'd imagine that the person who used ai would have to prove that they own the work. Which means they'd either have to admit to the use of ai, which would end their case, or lie and claim they made it themselves or comissioned someone, which I imagine wouldn't go far considering they wouldn't have proof they made it nor of an agreement with or transaction to an artist.


I would like to add a point to the copyright section. I'm unaware if it has been solved but because of how copyright works, technically nobody owns the art (imagine, text, etc.) that ai puts out. For something to be protected by copyright there has to be human authorship behind the work, and obviously ai programs aren't human. 

It's kinda in the same vein as commissioning someone. You describe what you want to an artist who creates the work, then you pay them. This payment is both for the work, the artists time, and certain rights to the piece that you're discussed with the artist prior. When giving an ai a prompt, you're not paying for anything. Not the work, not the time, and most definitely not the rights. So, if you use an ai to design a logo, for example, if someone else were to like that design and decided to use it for their own use, you wouldn't really have a case because you don't own the image.

I want to think that most people are too good and kind to be able to imagine how this thing can be used in nefarious ways by bad actors and how it can go wrong by itself in so many levels. It can write code and train itself. it can subjugate humans in a way that never before has happened , because it can process inane amounts of information. Yes it's not perfect yet, not nearly there yet, but do you think it'll be long before it can process the info of every single human who has used a computer or cellphone , directly or indirectly? It's literally able to create a Matrix -like reality. It could manipulate thoughts and even consent, but nobody seems worried about it, merely wary about misinformation. AI+ mass media and social platforms = Dystopia. It'll come a time when we start questioning what it actually means to be human and how much of our thoughts do we actually own.

There are people who are inspired to draw something in the style of artists for centuries. And its the same for outside of art too. Isn't newton inspiring new scientists every day. Or Niel Armstrong new astronouts. If we worry about the copyright of the images used to train the ai into creating an image in the likeness of another. Then we should also be worried about training humans the same way. I am not saying we shouldn't be worried about how fast AI is learning. We definitely should.

2023-06-10T23:38:26Z,@DustinRodriguez1_0,Rlq2CZI6wDo,"Something people should be aware of and think about with regards to the training of AI... that is almost exactly how human artists are trained.  Show up and ask someone who has never seen a pencil sketch or a watercolor or the type of dog you're asking about and ask them to create the same images and they, too, will fail utterly.  By showing them many examples of other peoples work, they start to learn what is meant by 'pencil sketch' and 'dog' and such.  The way this learning occurs is that neurons in the brain are 'trained' by having their activation thresholds change.  The way a deep learning AI system is trained, the learning occurs by adjusting activation thresholds of nodes in a big network very similar to the network of neurons in your brain.  If the AI is committing copyright infringement - then so are you.  As for giving permission, the permission has been given by making the works publicly available.  There is a very simple way to prevent AI or other artists from learning your style or perceiving your work - don't distribute it.  

Misinformation is an old problem, and it's a problem that we have faced before.  Every single time new communication mediums were developed, for instance, there were concerns about what was being communicated and whether it was guaranteed to always be entirely truthful.  From permitting the general public to learn to read and write, to the printing press, to telephones, TV, and, of course, the Internet, every single one was greeted with questions about how anyone could trust the information communicated.  While this certainly doesn't mean that it's not a problem, it's just one that we figured out the answer to a very long time ago.  The audience has to use critical thinking to evaluate everything they read and see.  That has always been the solution, and while a million different attempts have made to come up with some way that audiences could avoid ever learning critical thinking skills or using them but still be protected from misinformation, every one fails.  Critical thinking is, and has been for a very long time, absolutely necessary to avoid becoming lost in a sea of confusion.  That was true even before the introduction of the printing press.

It's not really true at all that ""we have no transparency at the moment as to what data it was trained on.""  We have great transparency on most of it.  For instance, for ChatGPT, the data it was trained on was a dataset called openwebtext originally, and then further training was done on other datasets, all of which are entirely publicly available.  There are some parts of ChatGPT that are not publicly available, but those aren't the training dataset, they are things OpenAI paid for like in order to train ChatGPT to not produce offensive or dangerous content, it hired a bunch of people to talk to an early version of ChatGPT and flag any responses that were problematic.  I think it was around 1,000 people they had do this.  Then they created a separate AI trained to recognize responses that seemed similar to the flagged responses, and used that to adjust ChatGPT to not produce output like that and instead produce messages like ""I can't give information about cooking crystal meth"" instead of just giving a recipe.  That part is mostly not available, but OpenAI published a whole bunch of research papers explaining exactly how they did every part of it.  If you have a couple million dollars and want to reproduce their work, it wouldn't be that difficult.  And this is true of most of the AI systems we have seen so far - they are very public about their datasets (most are available on a website called HuggingFace) and techniques, you can find a mountain of research papers on ArXiv.org.  

I would be careful saying that the court decision we have seen so far are good news for graphic designers.... Because of the way they wrote the court decision, if you use any tool that uses any kind of AI at any part of the process of creating an image, the whole work would not be permitted to be copyrighted.  And Adobe Photoshop is integrating a bunch of AI features.  I predict that court decision will be modified, but so far, its still legally unclear.

GPT-4 had definitely changed my job.  I do software engineering and systems administration type stuff.  And I use ChatGPT for generating stuff and helping me with obscure technical problems all the time.  GPT-4 is an extremely useful tool and my boss bought our engineering team licenses for it and encouraged its use.  It just makes us more productive.  You couldn't give it to a non-technical user and expect them to do much, though.  I studied Computer Science AND philosophy in college and I've got to say... that was the right choice to be very excited about AI.",2023-06-10T23:38:26Z

2023-06-10T23:24:33Z,@user-we1fk4ul5o,Rlq2CZI6wDo,"I share all the same concerns. My main one is how AI image generation has already begun to harm women & girls. ‚ÄúDeepfake‚Äù porn was already an issue, but deepfakes 10 years ago were nowhere near as effective as they are now; men take photos of women & girls they‚Äôre friends with, & create images of them in pornified contexts using AI. It was already bad enough that women & girls could have private pictures (or worse‚Äîdocumented violent acts of misogyny against females, such as r*pe) leaked onto major porn sites (none of which will do a single thing to address these issues as long as they drive traffic and are profitable); now any picture of a woman or young girl can be used to generate deepfake porn that is accurate enough to ruin lives. Yes‚Äîit was degrading & humiliating before‚Äîwhich should have been enough to enact change. Now it‚Äôs not only degrading & humiliating‚Äîit‚Äôs indistinguishable from reality. As I said, it‚Äôs already a challenge to get images & videos of real (private) sexual content or real sexual exploitation off the internet, let alone specific sites. What can women & girls do now? What options do we have? There are little to none. 

That should be enough to halt development & introduce legislation‚Äîon top of every other concern. People who are hungry for AI development continue to ask, ‚Äúhow will it really affect you?‚Äù, ‚Äúwho is it hurting?‚Äù‚Äîas if we‚Äôre brainwashed by tech fear-mongering or something. It‚Äôs already hurting people, is the thing. So. Here are my counter-questions: what will it take to prioritize legislation (careful advancement) over quick progress? How bad does it have to get before it‚Äôs ‚Äúworth‚Äù halting further development? If the endpoint is the same‚Äîwhy rush to get there? Why not do it right the first time, & ensure protections, rather than clean up the mess later?

I have my own concerns as a writer for what-could-be, but even those really pale in comparison to the damage being done to women & girls right now. There‚Äôs really nothing that would assuage my concern about this issue apart from rigorous legal protections & severe punishment. Anything else is a drop in the bucket, & will not deter porn-sick men whatsoever.",2023-06-10T23:24:33Z

But much more commonly, because an AI ""confidently makes stuff up"" when a question is asked that the AI's dataset doesn't directly answer, it's evidently possible that someone will innocently believe such a ""made-up"" answer to be true and then go on to mistakenly spread that information (which would be *mis*information).",2023-06-10T23:00:20Z

1.) What's stopping someone or a company from ""touching up"" the AI-generated work to claim it as their own?  As a professional animator & illustrator myself, I've heard about similar things happening in the past‚Äî not specifically with AI, but with other people's handiwork.  The script of the original ""Alien"" film was a notorious example in this industry, where some producers tried to steal the script by simply changing character names from the original credited writers

2.) If a company decides to create their own AI-generator, then call themselves as an artistic entity created by a human, could they circumvent the definition and therefore label their ""artworks"" under copyright?

3.) Does copyright even matter when someone or a company can simply purchase a trademark of their creations‚Äî or however the legal system works in claiming ownership of something?

They are teaching AI to lie about certain things, which is a huge problem, especially for children or adults who will just believe whatever the AI says, without researching the topic themselves. There's also the possibility that children can start having AI friends instead of real friends. Adults can have fake AI relationships instead of real ones, or be involved with AI porn, or even deep fake porn. There are deep fakes that can ruin reputations, and even create legal problems for people. What happens if some bad actor decides to make a convincing deep fake of someone showing that person committing a crime? Or even a recording of their voice confessing to the crime? The courts haven't caught up to that technology yet, and then it would be up to the accused to prove that they aren't guilty or that it isn't actually them in the video or recording. That moves the ""innocent until proven guilty"" to ""guilty until proven innocent."" Even if they can get out of criminal charges, it could still ruin their reputation, cost them their job, and who knows what else. This could be used to sway elections, or to smear political opponents. Even creating fake accounts with AI can be used to sway elections or to spread misinformation or propaganda. Then there's the problem that it could start making people dumber. There's already evidence that technology has made people dumber, because if you don't use your brain, if you can just ask google a question instead of thinking about it, or remembering answers, if you can use google maps to find your way around, instead of trying to remember the way, it makes you dumber. If you use technology instead of actually using your brain, it negatively affects your brain. There's also evidence that scrolling has negatively affected people's attention spans. All of these are big problems, especially since technology is addictive, in a way. It's a distracting and a way to avoid real life, but it doesn't actually make you happier. It actually distracts you from things that could make you happier.

Look at what the algorithm did with that wooden etching video - it caused many lives to be ended and human intervention struggled to have an impact in stopping it doing this.
AI will also be programmed by humans and we often act against our own best interests let alone the interests of wider humanity. All you'd have to do is set the AI on the task of making our lives better and it would instantly choose to enslave us because we can't be trusted not to set the planet on fire while simultaneously flooding it. As a species we kill millions through our poor decisions and ways of living. If I was an AI then I might think it was in people's best interest not to be able to do many of the things we currently do. You'll never get the nuance with AI that you get with human minds.

If AI ever reaches our intelligence, it will certainly be able to surpass it and then it's not up to us what it chooses. And on the way to total extinction of humans there are countless ways it could go awfully wrong. Just mistakes alone are potentially disastrous. I can't see any benefit for AI coming from the debates. I think it would be better to get off your lazy butt and write your own dissertation, take some time to work problems out and employ people to do work, rather than palm it off to an AI that may or may not know what's best for us, and may or may not choose it would be better of without us.

Also to say - I'd change the reporting system on here. I'd only make people watch reported videos if there was serious doubt. Providing an actual way to report awful content would fix the issues. If a certain percentage of watchers report something and fill in the box with similar text to describe the issue, then it's removed and up to the owner to show how it does not contain those things. Only if it's contested will a human watch it and see if it's ok. It would also give them advanced warning of exactly what they might see. To be honest, if it's been reported as containing something that distressing by so many people then they shouldn't have to watch it. It means, when we report 5-minute crafts etc, we're all saying the same thing and moderating content as a community. It's up to them to then show the video doesn't do the things we've reported it does. And a person can watch and say ""yes, it does do what has been reported so it's not being put back up"".",2023-06-10T10:54:00Z

The software I currently use the most, synthesizerV, utilizes AI trained models for the databases in conjunction with the traditional concatentative synthesis method to produce a result that sounds more realistic. This allows the musician that is using that vocal instrument to be able to spend less time making the voice sound realistic and more time making the voice sound more expressive and emotional. All of the input and creativity still has to come from the artist, as it still just functions like a regular instrument where entering the melody and adjusting Dynamics and different aspects of the vocal instrument is entirely up to the user, but the AI model allows for the voice to sound more realistic with a less intense amount of effort, leading to better creativity.",2023-06-10T06:57:26Z

2023-06-10T05:45:35Z,@rw7003,Rlq2CZI6wDo,"I love this channel.  Ann, you're such a great source of information and entertainment.  You have a wonderful ability to explain things to a wide audience, young and old, without and skipping on too much fundamental detail. 

I work in an organisation that provides customer services and has a large IT department.  Late last year, I thought in the next 5 years AI would replace a large portion of knowledge based jobs that are non-life-critical, do not pose significant profit risk, and that currently utilise a good company knowledge database (eg. Call centre role).  AI software may be able to replace non-senior/non-expert roles in these cases.  AI would handle 75% of the usual customer enquiries, and refer the 25% complex enquiries to a senior/expert. Complex enquiries being those typically involving a clerical or system issue.  

I still think this may happen, but maybe not as quickly and as smoothly. 

Companies will be motivated by a substantial cost saving with an acceptable level of risk.  The risk being difficulty interacting with the AI, or inaccurate advice or poor resolution.  Similar to the early days of voice recognition systems.  

However eventually the level of AI customer service would be, at worst, the same level of  human error.  But most likey better, with more accuracy and consistency in advice and actions, and less wait time on the phone or chat.  

The first few years of emergence will be a bit dodgy, as the first adopters may be companies desperate to make savings, without the financial or technical capability to deliver and quickly improve or maintain a quality AI system.  

But companies that want savings, but are a little more risk adverse, will spend a bit more time to develop a well-functioning AI before letting it loose on their customer base.  For the first one or two years they will probably support it with their current staff, until it is proven reliable.  At which point then they will start redeploying staff to other roles, or reduce staff numbers.  

Also at which point, they probably will have invested so much time and money that it will be difficult to decide to abandon.  After all, going back to 100% human customer service probably also means a return to lengthy call/chat wait times.  Not good when your competitors are still answering within a few minutes, not in 20.  And you might think you'd rather wait to interact with a human, rather than an AI.  But also remeber that you probably currently hate waiting 20 minutes just for someone to answer - not knowing if they will be helpful and correctly provide what your needing.

On another point - I think the fastest thing we'll see AI make  an impact on is document editing.  AI is already being embedded into email and document software, like Outlook and Word.  It'll offer improvements like a spell checker, such as suggesting better phrasing, tone etc.  Everyone will be able to spell correctly and write like a scholar!  Which raises the question: will reliance on that make us better or worse?  Worse, in that you won't need proper writing skills to sound brilliant, and in a way is kind of fake?  Or better, in that seeing the suggestions provides you with feedback, constant coaching, by which you will learn and become better day by day?",2023-06-10T05:45:35Z

Even WORSE, the new only covered the angle of the kid's relative having to relive their pain with this video being aired.

it would be like not allowing students to read any books or look at any artwork when they write or draw. think about that very hard, think even longer about it until it clicks.

using AI to create media is like a human using a computer to create media, a human is involved at some point. AI needs input and the input given depends on what the human puts in. in paint, a human puts in input and they get a output. with AI, a human puts in input and they get a output. there is ZERO difference.

the only valid point i can see is the misinformation point and that is not just concerning but alarming. it was clear well before these things gained popularity that it was going to be a problem.

jobs? that doesn't actually matter in the grand scheme of things. there will always be demand for ""human made"" content, even if it's entirely pointless to do. jobs will be lost, however jobs will always be gained in other areas. someones gotta train the AI, someone has to maintain the equipment, software, power requirements, infrastructure, etc. 

setting the human race back over this is honestly such a human thing to do. humans really do love to put chains on others over such pitiful things. in 100 years people will look back at this time period and wonder....why the hell were people so foolish for delaying our advancement.

I for one don't see the argument of AI leaning from copyrighted images as much of a problem. As an artist I learned from and copied many other artists styles. That's just how it is. As long as it's not a direct copy of the original work it's fine. I also don't think you should have the option of opting out of the training if your work is accessible online. If I want I could download an artists work and teach myself to copy their style and it's 100% legal. I don't see how AI should be treated different.

As a programmer I LOVE ChatGPT. If I'm stumped I can ask it to debug my code and it finds my problem within seconds. I can also ask it to create a code segment, or even a full method. The time is has saved me is immense.",2023-06-10T03:18:35Z

2023-06-10T03:04:33Z,@wakingcharade,Rlq2CZI6wDo,"The solution to people losing their jobs has always been large scale reforms to keep people from losing safety and security dependant on having a job - this wouldn't solve every problem, and its a long term goal, and I don't say it as a way to dismiss the pressing economic realities and anxiety and issues happening in the now. But it's not just jobs AI replaces -- if we promised people safety and their needs met, people fighting against shutting down coal plants would have much less leverage. Bosses that abuse their workers would have much less leverage. If someone gets sick, or has to stay home to care for a loved one, they would be safe and secure. Some people think that if everyone could have their basic needs met, no one would work at all, and thus nothing would get done. I disagree with this in general, studies of UBI pilot programs also disagree with this - people tend to go into training or education and often end up with better employment instead. But in a field like art, I really disagree with it. People create art without monetary incentive all the time. Obviously, artists deserve to be paid for their work. But the idea that art itself would disappear from human creation if no one HAD to create art to eat is silly to me.

AI feels like a tool to me. Tools can be used to assist people and make their jobs easier, increase their output, or automate things they don't want to do. Before these tools,  sometimes these things were still outsourced (and may or may not have been compensated to the person it was outsourced too) -- many of the great master painters had studios full of assistance whose names no one knows who painted huge amounts of their famous canvases. The names of editors are often lost to history, though many professional editors will tell you some of the most famous literary styles come more from the editor desk than the writer whose names you know. We already have artists using premade assets to make backgrounds - some more ethically sourced than others. We already have animators who use AI assisted software to track movements. These are still art, even as jobs may have been lost in the changing way things work. You can get completely free open source rigging now, and let the AI light a full scene with a click. I am not saying thats the same thing as using midjourney to make a whole painting, but I'm not sure I know where the line is or why its there. If someone uses an AI to make 20 pictures and then collages those images into a very human directed scene, are we back in the realm of human art? I cannot say. What if they paint over it? Distort it? Alter it in photoshop? Simply use it as a reference for a freehand painting? If a writer uses a writing software to correct their typos, or to replace a word they overuse - that's still a human writer. If a writer puts their stream of consciousness quick draft with dialogue and beats in, and the AI writes a second draft of that, and then a human edits that, is that still human writing? I'm less clear.

And its strange to see people dismissing other work - especially things we have kind of arbitrary decided are crafts rather than 'proper art' as ""different"" --  lace making is a famous one -- as if the labor and time expertise and traditions and training that go into trades are lesser expressions of humanity. Anyone who has ever watched one of those old compilation videos of prep kitchen workers or street venues moving at astounding speed to the beat of a radio should understand the things we traditionally view as elevated are, in some sense, pretty arbitrary. So should we not automate fruit slicing? Or should we hope for a world where everyone can gain artistry where they desire to, with the security and freedom and tools to do it?

This is why I'm glad this video mentioned radiologists and data analysis - both jobs where were created in the last 100 years and could be forever altered or changed beyond our current recognition by AI. But there are also jobs being automated away that maybe should be? A fully automated amazon warehouse would cost millions of jobs. Does that mean we shouldn't try to replace all that bending and sorting and lifting with machines if we could? It's a very complicated situation, and I understand the impulse to say ""no, manual labor is different than artistic labor"", I really do, but I think some of what we call one and not the other is culturally influenced and biased as well. I don't claim to have the answers

I know this is ideological and long term and doesn't address the real loss of income and security people are facing. I'm just trying to figure out what the best way to get those things back is, and if fighting automation is that.",2023-06-10T03:04:33Z

Now, I don't think the mainstream casual consumer will care or notice, which is the distressing part. I teach English in Korea, and the government here just announced their intention to basically stop using teachers to teach content and instead basically be class minders (to foster kids' emotional and social well-being, which like, honestly are not what teachers are especially trained for.) That sounds like a disastrous plan because AI is not sophisticated enough to be trusted to give kids accurate information, nor are kids yet aware of how to critically evaluate content--that's what teachers help them do! As usual, the government has totally jumped the gun trying to reform was is objectively a broken education system (Here, it's very reliant on memorization rather than creativity and critical problem solving).

I was conducting a silly little experiment with Dall-E a few months ago, I was attempting to see if I could identify any unique traits, or, any tells of the artists' who's works had been used to generate them by repeatedly running queries on specialized prompts. I did so by using long prompts, specifying very specific fandoms on the internet to try and narrow the pool of data that it had generate off of. I was generating sci-fi themed images, and one of my tests was for characters from a kid's show I watched in the 90's, Beasties, or, Beast Wars - see, in Canada, at the time, no children's show could have the word ""war"" in the title, so, outside of Canada, it was known as ""Beast Wars,"" and for me, it was ""Beasties."" I generated a swath of images from the latter, and the images I got were fairly stock sci-fi images; lots of blue backgrounds, with the characters highlighted in neon light - very Cyberpunk. When I changed ""Beasties"" to ""Beast Wars,"" however, that changed instantly. All the characters I received were looking off into the distance, chest puffed out, with heavenly clouds in the background, and golden light rays streaking past them. They were all, consistently, images of glory, the kind of thing you see in things meant to deify warfare.

The AI wants to score well, valid targets are positive points and non-targets are negative points. 
Well ... the AI drone killed its human operator and then killed all available targets (in the virtual simulation).  You see, according to AI logic, to achieve maximized points, it had to take out the human operator who designated certain targets as off-limits and created conditions that would create negative points.

Which, if you know anything about how black men were and are historically targeted by police and how they're treated once they are released from prison, is clearly not a fair assessment of these people.

Her family kept her artwork up so that people could continue to appreciate it and be inspired. Ive already seen ai use her artworks. Whether someone asked the ai to copy her style or they asked for something else and it just took parts of her work, it feels so wrong... 
Considering ai needs to take artworks to use to generate new creations, yet not a single one of those artists have been asked for permission. Its basically stealing. 
All that hard work they put into those pieces, all that love- we put a little bit of ourselves into every single piece we create. The skills they built up to create these, it feels like a waste.

There's also the ethical problems of training AI based on people's works without their permission, in fact there was a scandal a year or two ago where AI was able to replicate the style of a recently deceased artist without the permission of the artist before their passing or the permission from the artist's relatives. Then there was the controversy with DeviantArt where for a short while everyone's profiles and artworks was automatically opted in to train their Dream AI art program, meaning any users who were oblivious to this news or dead did not or could not opt out having their art used for the algorithm.

2023-06-09T21:05:36Z,@stygianoatman,Rlq2CZI6wDo,"What worries me most about AI isn't the job replacement, singularity, or copywrite issues. I think the worst part about it is that AI threatens to replace CREATIVITY itself. People can easily fall for the convenience it offers. Why learn to draw when an AI can do it for you? Why learn to write, when an AI can do it for you?

To create art is a journey, it's a wonderful feeling to make things. Getting good at an instrument. Finishing a thoughtful essay or script. Cooking a delicious meal for your family. The quality of that music, writing, cooking, etc. isn't all that AI cannot replicate. It cannot give you a feeling of TRUE satisfaction.

While the outcome of art is fantastic, and I do love a good song, book, meal, etc. those are all just products, and I don't believe we should treat art (or care about it) for what it yields, but the joy it brings to produce. We are human, we were meant to express ourselves, having evolved to communicate using complex language, and making art on cave walls. AI is a quick and easy way to get the product, without the journey and self-expression.

In my opinion, you miss out on a big part of life itself, by letting  an AI create something for you. That brain is a muscle, use it or lose it.

Lastly, AI has no love for anything, even if it became advanced to mimic it, there's no hormones responsible for love, a machine cannot feel. If a Grandma bakes you cookies, you know she does it with LOVE. If a robot made you cookies, there is no love behind that. Same goes for making AI create artwork of your pet. An AI feels nothing when it looks at an image of a kitten, puppy, etc... how are people okay with this?

The use of AI can be problematic and insulting to others, but I think it's equally insulting to the self (if not more so). As humans, we should remember we are alive. We DO feel. An AI cannot make something because it loves you, it cannot be your friend, you deprive yourself of true connection by using it. Creation is an expression of love, I believe. A selfless expression (generally). We sing to express ourselves, and it brings people together because we resonate with those feelings. We cook for those we care about. We procreate because we see the beauty of life, and wish for it to thrive and persevere, like it always does.",2023-06-09T21:05:36Z

People have been reselling patreon content or straight up giving out for free for years. Artists have to deal with their works being stolen and traced or recoloured with thieves claiming they have created that work themselves and often need to take action against these people to make them stop - hell I myself had someone steal and lazily draw over an old sketch of mine on Discord, despite the WIP of my image being 2 posts above it, and the thief panicking and just disappearing once confronted about it.

The freelance artist market is heavily stacked and still growing, and artists are constantly underselling their work to remotely get their business off the ground (especially when compared to industry standards and salaries.) AI art does nothing but flood an already saturated market with, what in my opinion, is essentially digital forgeries that undervalue the actual work and skill that goes into making art. They solely focus on the outcome and product of the art and never the process or fun that goes into making it. And whilst some AI outcomes can be easy to tell if their made using AI, that argument is not going to hold up for long, and it already isn't. PLENTY of AI users (especially furry related ones) on twitter are mass producing artwork that look nigh indistinguishable from actual pieces. There are already many dramas and communities that are turning on legitimate artists under the suspicion their works may be done by AI when they aren't.

And no, learning how to use the programs to produce AI art barely compares to actually learning to draw - using a bunch of code made by someone else, that rearranges noise and pixels from existing assets stolen from the works of others does not make you an ""artist."" If you know how to mod games like Minecraft or a Fallout game, you can easily figure out how to use Stable Diffusion locally on your computer through process of mucking around and finding out what settings and prompts works best. That is never going to be a comparable substitute for learning all the art fundamentals, years of practice and studying to actually be able to draw, paint, model, animate, etc.

Most artists can't even fight for the copyright of their own work like the music industry can because we can't afford to toss around lawsuits everywhere, especially the younger lot in the freelancer crowd. A lot of us are just average people trying to get by, so when we see our work stolen we just have to kinda call it out in public/online and hope they stop out of guilt on their consciousness (which never happens, because they'll usually just grift from another artists work instead or just rebrand under a new account.)

And just,
us artists don't need ""AI art programs"" that make stuff for us, because artists literally pride themselves on making things. We love the process, thats why we literally do it lmao. We have been using AI tools for a pretty long time to create shortcuts and make processes easier, such as CSP with the pose or hand scanner that makes the posing of 3D models easier, or interpolation for animators on programs like Cacani, but they never automatically make the things for us because that takes half the fun out of art; MAKING IT. So the people who benefit from AI art generators are literally grifters and commissioners who want something made on the fly",2023-06-09T20:49:41Z

I won't change any of the rest of my comment I guess for honesty in what I said. My opinions regarding ""misinformation"" still stand - it is an extremely overused word since 2020 for [real life events that aren't allowed to be talked about] and I'm sick of hearing the word so I overreacted. Sorry for that and what I said about you below.

Ann, I love you, but calling an image one of these machines create where a child's body is depicted backwards ""misinformation"" is the absolute most braindead thing I've Amber Heard from you. Seriously. By that logic, anything from Escher would be ""misinformation"" as well or other optical illusions wheres there are 4 elephants in an image but their legs are intentionally depicted to look like there are more legs than what fits the amount of elephants by clever use of empty space and whatnot (by a human artist and yes, this is a real image, but I don't know the name or artist, it was hanging in my doctor's office when I was a kid)

You'd have been better off using an example of asking ChatGPT some objectively verifiable/known truth or fallacy question. And even then, it's not likely ""misinformation"", it's bad training or bad classification of data or poor accuracy or something that causes it to be incorrect. It's only ""misinformation"" if the company claims the program to be highly or perfectly accurate and/or people expect it to be highly or perfectly accurate.",2023-06-09T20:49:10Z

I don't see why it would be so bad to have an AI create an image that is derivative of one's own work, a human could do that, and we cherish that! Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, after all. I think it is also important to note that ALL artists create derivative works. Nobody creates anything original, we are all influenced by works we have seen. We all stand on the shoulders of giants.

2023-06-09T20:23:34Z,@kanrafingerguns,Rlq2CZI6wDo,"I'm an author, and AI has definitely been a big topic in the writing community.

I am not worried about AI becoming a better novelist than me. However, I am concerned with the market. A few problems off the top of my head:

1. **Competition.** If you see an AI book or an ad for one, that is a space in the search results that could have gone to an actual author.

One can generate and publish a short AI book in a week or less. That's a LOT of added competition. Publishing is a highly competitive market already‚Äîit's *really difficult* to get visibility. Authors shouldn't have to deal with getting drowned out by AI.

2. **Low-quality books pushing consumers away from buying indie.** Self-publishing gets a bad rap because, let's be real, lots of them are awful. Many people refuse to buy indie for this reason. However, the market has seen a rise in quality indie books as professional resources and knowledge on publishing have become widely available.

But here's the thing: AI books suck and readers want a story told by a human. But not all ""authors"" who publish AI books are transparent about that. They're just going to show up on Amazon as an indie book.

If there's an issue with buying AI books without knowing until it's too late, people may get sick of it and avoid anything self-published so they don't get scammed.

3. **Authors unintentionally/unknowingly using AI.** There was recently an author who has gotten hate and boycotts over her book cover containing AI art. What many people don't know is that traditionally-published authors (as this woman was) don't get a say in their cover.

This was completely on the publishing company, but she's now getting the blame.

Furthermore, I also recently saw an indie author who paid a cover artist...not knowing they used AI art for the book cover. He then got dragged for it.

People can be vile. Review bombing and a smeared reputation can drive an author into the ground in a way they may never recover from.

It's already causing problems, and I unfortunately have a feeling it will only get worse.",2023-06-09T20:23:34Z
2023-06-09T20:20:08Z,@himselfe,Rlq2CZI6wDo,"It's amusing to me that a food scientist on a food related channel can present the situation with more veracity than media outlets that are actually focused on tech. Great video that will hopefully help many people get somewhat of a clearer picture on the situation. Some notes of input I'd like to add:

AI _unintentionally_ training on AI generated output is actually a good thing in terms of avoiding misinformation because generation loss will ultimately lead to AI just spitting out complete gibberish making it functionally useless. I say _unintentionally_ because part of training generative models like midjourney involves AI training on AI generated output.

For job loss, current gen AI is incapable of replacing talent or highly skilled work. Taking programming as an example, ChatGPT is actually very bad at it even though it can create convincing output that might fool an unskilled programmer. Competent software businesses aren't going to be replacing programmers with AI any time soon, though there is a great risk that the industry will face a shortage of skilled programmers as new programmers perceive ChatGPT to be an useful tool for learning (it is not). In terms of art, the artists most at risk are concept artists, where the art is not intended as the end product, but rather a guide for ideas.

Plagiarism is an issue however, both for art and word as you have pointed out, and even in the programming world as AI has no knowledge of software licenses and will happily spit out stolen code without crediting the author.

All in all, properly designed and utilized AI _is_ a good thing for humanity, and must inevitably replace jobs (as much technological development has throughout history) if humanity is to progress sustainably. The real challenge is shifting the economy to ensure that such developments don't result in widening class divides and amplifying poverty. If done properly, tech can help humanity *end* poverty, and AI is no exception, but that really relies on having competent legislators who understand the tech and are willing to enact in the public interest. The greatest problem humanity faces is still political. We don't have to worry about hyper intelligent AI any time soon because current gen AI is still little more than a novelty that can do fancy tricks. While we are getting a better understanding of the broader mechanics of cognition, intelligence is still largely a mysterious black box. The fundamental concepts behind AI haven't progressed much, we simply have the computing power to build larger models now.

Barring a more natural cataclysm, advanced AI will come some day though, so humanity should use this time to adapt shape developments in the right direction, in favour of broader human interests than the profits of a minority.",2023-06-09T20:20:08Z

Is it the administration who approved the AI to provide diagnoses instead of a human professional? Is it, if there is one, the human supervisor of thr AI? We discussed this at length in our university courses (I'm doing my masters degree in psychology) and we could not reach a satisfactory conclusion.

But if anyone's going to suggest that taking inspiration from someone else's work is wrong? Then every architect and their work should be destroyed, every painting after the first artist who ever painted should be fined down to the 50th generation and their work destroyed, every written copyrighted work after the first written work should be destroyed and the author fined to the 50th generation, etc etc etc. Everything is inspired by something or someone else's already existing work.
There are people who are so highly skilled with a pencil that they can replicate a photograph - should they face copyright bs from the camera company/artist who took a photograph?
There are people who can near-perfectly replicate Van Gogh's painting styles - should they face copyright bs for doing so?
Anyone who thinks ""yes"" to those and similar questions must have some sort of f3tish for copyright, which is a very VERY broken system as it currently stands.
How about ventriloquists, some of whom can produce nearly indistinguishable voices from the person they're mimicking?

Would it be courteous to at least ask if these programs can be trained on certain works? Sure.

No, I'm not joking.
If you put a piece of art out for the public to see, hear, touch, experience and you (general) expect or worse, DEMAND them not to be inspired by it, you're (general) psychotic. Don't want people to be inspired by your work or ever create anything that clearly takes inspiration from your style, even if to show you how much they love your work, so much they wanted to emulate you, then don't make anything at all.

As a tech writer, I have learned to spot patterns (including being fairly reliable in identifying the native language of various writers writing in English). I can generally spot the patterns in AI text, and can trace its evolution, since I've watched it ""grow up."". It's still essentially a probability generator. 
It has no concept of context. It does not distinguish Joe Smith the physicist from Joe Smith the dead cartoonist, and can mix and match. It literally does not know what ""it"" refers to. If I switch context, and ""it"" now refers to a cartoonist's works, it can hallucinate a reference. There is a case where a cybersecurity expert asked what chatGPT knew about him, and it replied with his obituary, and insisted he died in 2017. Even a nonfunctioning URL was furnished as a reference. But since it didn't know that a URL needed to point to collaborating information, it could not show where this information was obtained.

2023-06-09T19:42:47Z,@metaknightmare1234,Rlq2CZI6wDo,"First of all I'd like to say good video from Ann as per usual. As an artist though, I'd like to give my 2 cents as this has been a major topic in the community.

First and foremost, I want to be clear that the AI in the format that it is now is unequivocally bad. The reason for this isn‚Äôt because what a lot of people like to argue about in the news or social media or other places. It‚Äôs because as Ann touched on in her video, AI as it functions now is entirely built off theft and stolen work. People want to argue a lot about philosophy and what ""art"" really means and the human value of creating art and etc, but that is besides the main and primary issue that everything ""generative AI"" creates is 100% built on other artists' work, most often, *stolen* work which they are not compensated for.

Proponents of AI try so hard to dress up and hide this fact behind fancy buzzwords like ""oh you just don't understand stable diffusion or machine learning or algorithms"" or whatever other new thing it supposedly is that makes it not theft. But repeatedly several times, it is obvious to anyone with functioning eyes that supposedly ""original"" AI generated images are 1 to 1 matches with STOLEN artwork under copyright and nonconsensually taken without permission from the original artist. If you are doubtful please just look up examples on google and take a look  at side by side comparisons and it is boggling that people will even try to attempt to argue otherwise. Even giving benefit of the doubt, AI and computers do not do what you ‚Äúwant‚Äù them to do. AI and computers do what you *make* them to do, and whether consciously or not, they are 100% absolutely made to steal work from real human beings.

Let's be very clear, the AI is not ""making"" anything. It is fundamentally different from when a human artist takes inspiration from others. When it completely screws up hands with 6 fingers or makes weird flesh blobs of anatomy, why does it do that? Is it because the AI ""thinks"" that's what hands look like? Is it trying a new expressionist take on body horror and aesthetics? No, it's because it literally doesn‚Äôt have the capacity to understand what a hand even is. When it puts gibberish scribbles in the corner of its image, is it because the AI is being cute and wants to ‚Äúsign‚Äù its work? No, it's because it doesn't know what a signature *is* and there are so many stolen pieces used to build it that it even tries to copy the signatures of the artists that it steals from!

The best analogy I have for it is imagining going to 2 baker's shops. You take 2 cakes (without paying btw), cut them in half, and then go ""look everyone, look at this cake that *I* made"" and then reselling the 2 cake halves to other people as an original work. Obviously people are going to look at that and call it nonsense because it's obvious that you just slapped together 2 other people's work. But then what happens if you do it with 4 bakers, and cut the cake into quarters? What about 10? 100? What about a million tiny slices cut and re-pieced into a Frankenstein cake? What if the slices become so small, that you cannot even tell with the human eye anymore?

Maybe you, a human being can't cut a cake into a million pieces to splice together, but a computer sure can. And that in short (though it is a bit more complicated than that) is exactly what AI ""art"" is doing. It does not ‚Äúcreate‚Äù anything new or original, it is 100% derivative of other artists‚Äô work. And most notably, take into consideration how this business model is 100% unsustainable and impossible without taking other people's work that was already created - it cannot and does not actually ""make"" anything from scratch.

People want to argue about ""taking inspiration"" and ""learning"" as if the machine or AI is a person. But the fact of the matter is it's not. It's as simple as that. It does not have the capacity to learn and function like a person or create art like a person or ""create"" anything on its own, period. It is the fundamental difference of a person going to a bakery, discovering they like the way a baker makes a cake, then attempting to mix batter and bake the ingredients to recreate the cake they like vs the plagiarized Frankenstein cake scenario I explained above.

There is a saying in art that ‚Äúeverything is derivative‚Äù in the sense that more or less everything in the art world is built from what came before it. Similarly in writing, it‚Äôs not a coincidence that many stories contain many shared elements to the point we even have a term for it - tropes. In the musical western 12 tone scale, there are only so many combinations you can put those 12 notes to make a tune, and things like sampling are even welcomed and encouraged.

But there is a big difference in using samples in music or taking a general story structure of the hero‚Äôs journey, or using tropes like found family or villain redemption arcs vs literally copy pasting other people‚Äôs stories and characters into one you call your own using a thesaurus to change a few of the words, or tracing over another person‚Äôs artwork and then calling it original, or splicing 8 other musical artists‚Äô songs into 8 pieces then mashing them together and calling it a new song made by you.

To make derivative works transformative, you have to actually *do* something to make them different from the original art, that‚Äôs why things like remixes and covers can exist. But AI does not ‚Äúdo‚Äù or ‚Äúcreate‚Äù anything. No matter how many cakes you slice and mash together, you don‚Äôt actually bake anything. Most notably, if those other bakers did not exist, your entire product, your AI ‚Äúartwork"" also would not exist. It is a shameless bastardization of an industry that solely relies on stealing the work of others in order to function.

And this is what separates from things like human art, music, or storytelling. Even without those who came before, even if Shakespeare did not exist, even if Da Vinci had never painted, people who came after can and will still find their own inspiration and create new and interesting work, even without literally taking from other artists‚Äô products.

Without actual real artists to steal from, AI has nothing to offer. With human artists, even without access to other work, you can learn, you can create, you can conceptualize and think and understand *what a hand is.* You know that human hands usually have 5 fingers, even without having to consult and get inspiration from other artist's works. And everything all the AI proponents are trying to do is disguise and hide that fact, to treat it as if taking other people's work against their permission and putting it through a machine that hides the slices it steals is the same thing as a human being who can create, and that the obvious theft going on is okay then because of it. I am so tired of the AI ‚Äúdebate‚Äù being framed as some deep, nuanced issue about machine personhood and art philosophy and whatnot when in reality we‚Äôre nowhere even *close* to approaching that level of machine consciousness or development yet. The fact of the matter is it‚Äôs all just exploiting artists and creators and wanting to steal their work without having to pay them. Do not let them distract you from that!",2023-06-09T19:44:50Z

2023-06-09T19:28:33Z,@RMDetho,Rlq2CZI6wDo,"I firmly believe that copyright issues came somewhat as a red herring to divert eyes from the actual problems of AI. Just how you could spot issues with the recipe, I, as a programmer, can spot issues with generated code. AI is far from being intelligent. At best, on a human level, it is nothing but a people pleaser, and for anything other than the most basic things, a very bad one.

People think it's this magical app that will solve all of their problems, when in fact it might make the process worse, because even if you have to correct constantly, it doesn't mean that it's actually learning or that it will put that information to use, but instead it's just, again, saying what the person wants to hear. 

It's heavy dependance on the learning model also introduces a whole array of issues.. while it may be simpler in terms of art (whether written or drawn), in other aspects it often fails, because the material used isn't right. I've had mora than one occassion where I knew roughly how something in code is supposed to be, but wasn't too sure, and asked ChatGPT for that part. I did get my answer, but I got the most unoptimized, online course monkey code that I almost got offended looking at.

And in my opinion the biggest issue with this, just like with everything else, the easier something becomes more scum (collective for every person with malicious intent, be it those bots, ""art thieves"" or whatever) will use it for their own benefit. Before creating a game, or a script was hard and required professionals. Now if anyone can do it, anyone will. And anyone who wants to exploit something, now doesn't even have to be a professional in the field. And this will cause big problems for the general public who don't have the will or the time to check and verify everything they consume.. if it was an article they won't be able to tell apart genuine quality text from crap AI generated one. and an AI only needs to read a few to come up with something that sounds good.

For programmers, I believe the only viable method of using ChatGPT would be equal to asking a coworker. ""Write me my today's tasks"" won't do you any good, and nobody will say yes to that, but ""Hey, can you remind me what the function for XY is?"" can be a big help.",2023-06-09T19:28:33Z

No, you need to have a specific idea in mind, and AI gives you the opportunity and possibility to materialize that idea.

That comic wouldn't exist if it wasn't for AI, the author wouldn't hire an artist to do such thing. Copyright, in my opinion, should belong to ideas, not the materialization per se. Sure, our ideas are usually expressed through images made by ourselves but this technology reduces the difficulty of doing that, being the bridge between your mind and the real world.

Ask Chat GPT to prove a somewhat easy math theorem and it will usually produce something different than what was asked for, if it is even coherent. 

This is because it is not solving the problem, but rather it is searching for others who have solved the problem and copying what they've stated, but in a manner that combines different data points together rather than drawing from a single source. In the case of art or fictional literature, this is no issue. But when trying to produce a solid logical argument in this manner problems arise quickly.",2023-06-09T19:26:10Z

We saw this years ago with how machine translation put countless translators out of work despite machine translation being abysmal in quality, because both regular people and billion-dollar companies alike would rather have awful work on the cheap than have good work that costs money.

That's without getting into the issues with what AI tools are actually being used for. One start-up promises that their revolutionary new AI tools can look at a video of a person giving a statement and detect whether they're lying or not. Needless to say, their tools cannot do any such thing (though they are significantly more likely to flag black people as lying, for some mysterious reason), but the startup's main customers are insurance companies looking for excuses to falsely accuse legit customers of lying so as to have an excuse to falsely deny valid insurance claims.

Whats the answer? It has to do with what you believe about work, money, value, humanity, and so on. 

Are there enough jobs to go round and if not, what do we do? I just dont think its possible for us to eliminate the free market as our way of exchanging value, countries that have tried to do so like North Korea have simply driven it underground. I think the answer has to lie in innovation, not regulation, and especially not banning new technology. Instead, we need to think creatively about how to center human stories. 

As an example, I once saw a video about a woman who was blind and deaf who used to make and sell these little clay kangaroo statues. They were the sort of things that could have been easily mass-produced, but I know I would have paid more for her statue over a mass-produced one, because of the personal connection behind it.

But if an image is going to be sold, or used in advertising, or monetised in some other way, then the authors of whatever copyrighted materials were used to train the AI should be paid a proportional amount of royalties.
I've heard some object to this and argue that the AI process of absorbing a lot of artistic material and producing something roughly akin to it is really no different than how artistic inspiration works with people. I don't really buy this, because AI is obviously just a collection of code and can't produce anything as a form of genuine artistic self-expression. If you had an AI in the distant future that *could* express genuine artistic intention‚Äì and there's a lot of science fiction written about just such an eventuality‚Äì then that would mean it's experiencing real emotion and free will as a non-human person, and it should therefore be paid a fair wage for its creative work to spend how it likes... thus defeating the financial advantage of even using AI.",2023-06-09T17:42:51Z

2023-06-09T17:40:38Z,@insertaigeneratedhandle,Rlq2CZI6wDo,"My problem with AI art specifically is not the AI or the art itself (yes, I do consider AI art, art because the meaning of art is derived from both its creator‚Äôs intent and the viewer,) but the way in which companies will try to use/profit from it.

There‚Äôs a few decent arguments for the creation of AI art in my opinion which mainly boils down to accessibility. If AI art becomes so advanced that it can basically produce whatever we imagine, disabled people and people who are simply unable to express themselves (whether it‚Äôs due to a lack of skill or lack of time) can use AI as a significantly faster and easier method to do so. I have no qualms about that to be honest. In a perfect world, AI art wouldn‚Äôt be a problem and people could have much more free time to do whatever, leaving all the AI/automation to do the menial and hard labor for them.

But that isn‚Äôt how the world is, and given the greed of mega corporations, we can‚Äôt expect them to act in a way that would be beneficial or even neutral to artists in the slightest. Practically every job that involves digital media can be replaced ‚Äî illustrators, freelance artists, even animators once the technology gets good enough ‚Äî and tech bros simply don‚Äôt care.   If you try to defend the hard-working artists they‚Äôll typically refute in three ways: Adapt or die, typical ‚Äúluddite‚Äù behavior, or the maybe it‚Äôs a good thing. All three of these arguments have a common thread and that is a disturbing lack of empathy. 

People who tell other artists to just incorporate AI into your artwork‚Ä¶ then literally what is the point? If you start incorporating AI into your art, then you‚Äôre basically selling yourself art, because even if you in-paint, you‚Äôre literally just letting the AI do all the hard work for you and in doing so, in my view at least, you devalue your art by getting rid of a part that is integral to human art, the hard work and dedication that you put in to your art. In this sense, how could you even suggest beginner artists to incorporate AI into their workflow? They‚Äôre not going to be able to learn and refine their skills and fundamentals, instead they‚Äôll be handing off the work to the AI which in turn, will stagnate their growth and potential.

AI art supporters calling artists who are genuinely concerned about their careers, ‚Äúluddites‚Äù is not doing anything other than fueling fire to the war on both sides, further hampering any compromise that could be made between the two.

The ‚Äúmaybe it‚Äôs a good thing‚Äù argument was something that I already addressed earlier. In a utopian/communist society, ideally you‚Äôd have practically every job to be automated which would provide humans a massive amount of free-time to do whatever. But in a capitalist society, like the world in which we live in today, allowing companies to copyright AI-produced media would only cut artists off from their source of income and therefore, extracting the value of their labor as AI art programs are trained on a database. Copyright is very anti-capitalist as it essentially grants smaller artists a monopoly over their original concepts and ideas so that they can hopefully profit from their work, which is why for now, this isn‚Äôt as big of a deal in the U.S. as it was ruled that AI-produced media cannot be copyrighted. Somewhat related (just wanted to get this off my chest lol,) but the whole photography and portrait artist argument is also a non-argument because it falsely equivocates two-seemingly related mediums that in actuality, entirely different. Photography and realistic portrait artists operate in two completely different mediums, even if their end goal is the same (which mind you, photography is more than just portrait pictures,) which cannot be said about digital art and AI art. All AI art (as of now,) is digital art, but not all digital art is AI art, and as such, the only thing that differentiates the two is the extent of how much human input has been put into the artwork, hence, literally the reason why digital artists are scared. AI has the potential to replace all digital art because it literally isn‚Äôt a new medium, it‚Äôs essentially just another artist who can produce artwork significantly faster and perhaps better than a supermajority of artists ‚Äî can you finally start making the connections now?

I don‚Äôt understand why when it comes to artists, and artists only, that people suddenly forget that a majority of artists are people who are struggling to make ends meet and not the snobby, cheese-eating pricks that tech bros make them out to be.",2023-06-09T17:40:38Z

15:44 I think this is a far too optimistic take on things.  Companies _today_ usually want exclusivity, but the reason for that is because _today_ creating and obtaining good-quality images is expensive and time-consuming, and they want to be able to protect that investment.  However, if we get to a point where anybody can get any image they want in a few seconds with no effort, then there's actually _no value in exclusivity anymore_ either (except possibly for things like trademarks, etc, but those are protected by other laws that would still probably apply the same, even with AI in the mix).

Even if they commission a work by a human artist so they can have a copyright and defend it, anybody who wants to can get around it by just making an AI create almost exactly the same thing (or better, more tailored to them) and use that instead.  So at that point, _no companies will actually have any reason to care_ whether images are copyrighted or not anymore (commissioning copyrightable works will then be just much more expensive for something that has no benefits, so they might as well just use AI for everything instead to begin with).",2023-06-09T17:15:07Z

2023-06-09T16:50:45Z,@sevret313,Rlq2CZI6wDo,"You're making one mistake in your description of how AI models are trained. They're not automatically just learning from the internet after training, which doesn't make sense because after training assumes that the training step is over. ChatGPT has had an issue with not knowing updated information. More and more language models are able to take in search data, but they're not training on this, just looking at the data and use it to generate new text and then forgetting about it.

If they're using proper search data from Google then more reliable sources should appear on the front page and misinformation won't automatically poison the results. Researchers are also aware of the problems and will definitely be careful with accepting new text from the internet into the models without knowing how to handle AI generated text.

In terms of deliberate misinformation. I don't see anything new here. We're already flooded by misinformation and the only reason we barely see any of it is that the different algorytms are good at detecting this and I see no sign of this changing.

When it comes to MidJourney a large portion of its training comes from getting feedback from the users where it learns what people like and doesn't like and is able to refine the results from images generated by itself without needing new data from the internet. I don't know how MidJourney collects it dataset so it might be getting new material from different websites but as it is closed we cannot know.

The only models that provingly learn a lot from the internet after training is Stable Diffusion as it's open but that's because people build upon it by building new datasets to create new models from. These can be hyperspesific. But that's a necessarily evil I'd say. By limiting AI-generation to big companies that owns a lot of IP and can afford to license everything you give them a competitive advantage that independent artists can't compete with at all. The more you try to restrict this the more you're securing Disney's monopoly against any competition.

AI borrows it bias from the internet, simple as that. When it comes to facial recognition it is as biased as the researchers and it is not an AI problem as we've seen this in all sorts of research that it's fitted white men. AI which is allowed to gather big datasets would always be better at reproducing niche content than AI with a smaller more restricted dataset.

And lastly when it come to jobs. If you want to work for the sake of working then that's good for you. But don't force everyone into working the same hours when we can use technology to give people more free time.",2023-06-09T16:50:45Z

2023-06-09T16:31:37Z,@ArokhaSieyes,Rlq2CZI6wDo,"Here's how I think of the style copying:
- Every style is some distance from every other style in quantifiable ways. Line thickness, preferred medium, preferred colors, etc.
- The 'AI' (really a bad term for this stuff) knows all these styles. For the record, it doesn't store the input text or images in the models it uses, it only stores 'how to make it look more like X'.
- You can imagine all these styles in 'a space', all different distances from each other the more different they are.
- You can style your prompts to art AIs so that you end up somewhere between all the existing styles, and develop your own, so that you aren't copying a specific person's style. You can then just copy that part of your prompt that is 'your style' and use that in all your prompts.

So whether you think copying a style is ethical or fine to do or not, it's totally avoidable when you're using the stable diffusion systems by just 'walking it' into an empty spot in the 'stylespace' by specifying five or six different artists you like, weighting them differently, even adding negative artist prompts to avoid styles you don't like. What you end up with is nothing like any of the artists you listed, it's something new.

Copying other people's styles has been a thing for centuries, and things like that and 'tracing' have always been frowned upon. Using AI to do those things should be no different, but, there ARE ways to make totally novel art in your own style with stable diffusion.",2023-06-09T16:31:37Z

ChatGPT: 
""Food colors are substances used to enhance the appearance of food products. They are generally considered safe when used in approved amounts and have undergone rigorous testing by regulatory authorities. However, adverse reactions to food colors are possible in rare cases, particularly in individuals who have specific allergies or sensitivities to certain ingredients.

While it is uncommon for food colors to directly cause deaths, there have been isolated reports of severe allergic reactions or adverse effects associated with their consumption. For instance, some individuals may experience allergic reactions to certain food dyes, such as tartrazine (Yellow 5) or carmine (a red color derived from insects).

It's important to note that regulatory bodies, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), closely monitor and regulate the use of food colors to ensure their safety. These agencies set acceptable daily intake levels and establish guidelines for their use in various food products. When used within these approved limits, food colors are generally considered safe for the general population.

If you have specific concerns about food colors or suspect an adverse reaction, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional who can provide personalized advice based on your individual circumstances.""",2023-06-09T16:29:54Z

Take the copyright example. Lets say a law is passed and copyrighted images can no longer being used without the artist's permission. However, someone really wants to copy a certain artist's style but that artist refuses to allow their work to be used. Are they out of luck? Not if they have enough money. They could hire other people to create images in that original artist's style and their work gets used as the inputs instead. 
This is the same problem as crimes where the only punishment is a fixed sum. Once you are rich enough you can just pay the fine and not care.

I did medical transcription, which eventually morphed into ""editing"" voice-recognition-generated reports (at a lower rate of pay, of course). The voice recognition would ""learn"" that when a particular doctor in a particular specialty said a particular phrase, what it meant, but it couldn't recognize exceptions. For example, when a doctor dictates the letters E, G, F, and R, he/she almost always means eGFR, which stands for estimated glomerular filtration rate. Once in a blue moon, in a patient with lung cancer, it should be EGFR, which stands for epidermal growth factor receptor. The E being capitalized or not makes a crucial difference. Voice recognition will ""learn"" that it is significantly more likely referring to eGFR and put that. Just one more example: Doctors frequently say adventitia when they are referring to adventitious sounds heard when listening to breath sounds. Voice recognition software will ""learn"" through the ""editing"" process to change adventitia to adventitious sounds. Adventitia, however, does have an actual meaning not related to breath sounds. It is the outer layer of fibrous connective tissue around an organ. An experienced medical transcriptionist can know the difference between eGFR and EGFR and adventitia as slang meaning adventitious sounds and actual adventitia and transcribe accordingly, but AI is nowhere near good enough. Those are only 2 examples from the multitude I remember from my time as a former medical transcriptionist, and yet voice recognition software with its AI component was responsible for a drop in pay such that I eventually left the profession. This will likely happen to more and more jobs as time goes on.",2023-06-09T16:03:56Z

2023-06-09T16:01:32Z,@Titleknown,Rlq2CZI6wDo,"Thankful for the relative nuance/lack of fearmongering in this video, adding my two cents as an artist who thinks the tech is super useful but is well aware of the dangers of it being potentially used to chickenize artistic labor, expanding copyright to cover style to ""stop"" AI art as some people have proposed would be a terrible idea.

Because, Disney; Warner; Universal, ect all have databases of art they totally legally (but unjustly IMO) own that they can train an AI art program on, in a way that would lead to the same displacement/replacement, just without the ability for the public to use it. So it's less a question of whether or not that will happen, and more whether everyone gets the tech or only megacorps get it at its full power and we're stuck with the one made using Wikimedia.

Plus, that's not even getting into the fact that historically expanding copyright/shrinking fair use has never worked long-term to help artists, and is in fact more often used to bully small artists by IP-hoarding megacorps (See also the history of sampling, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the various copyright term expansions), and thanks to the Blurred Lines case we have a principle like that to ""protect"" styles in music, and it is currently a legal and societal nightmare. You do not want that principle expanded to the visual arts, or indeed any of the draconian copyright tools the big music companies currently use as a cudgel.

Like, my preferred solutions would be expanding privacy law to avoid the non-consentual data scraping people are taking issue with, along with major pushes by labor for restrictions on corporate behavior specifically, like the current writers' strike, because there's a difference between corporate usage of these tools to turn art into a McJob and hobbyist/small creator usage of these tools, which despite the way it's been associated with hacks there are artists using it for some good stuff (Reachartwork/aicurio and Trent Troop's Deepdreamnights are my go-to examples).

On a level of preventing labor displacement, beyond the fact we need to fight for massive expansions of government arts funding (Though admittedly that's perhaps difficult to imagine in the libertarian nightmare world of the United States), on a ground-floor level a good place to start would be normalizing AI art commissions being done at the same pay-rate as traditional/digital-traditional art; if only to both avoid the undercutting that's a big worry with AI art and to incentivize skill rather than flooding the market with visual shovelware that's also a big worry...",2023-06-09T16:01:32Z

A human can produce an artwork in the style of Van Gogh, but probably only after intensive study of pictures originally painted by Van Gogh. The same is true for AI. It might be argued that the AI is just mashing existing works together, and that might be true particularly for some specific parts of the end product, but I suspect you'll find some original things in most of the output, within the limitations of whatever style was requested.

I think AI would struggle to create a completely original work that doesn't seem to be too weird or random. But if you specifically want something that seems to be original but follows a well established style or format, then AI might produce an output that would be equivalent to what you'd get from an actual human who is well trained in doing things in that style or format.

Governments and large companies put huge amounts of money into psychology to understand how to control and influence their customers and constituents. AI is going to be a bonanza for them. 

In the United States we've had a problem with social media online and corporate news outlets that refused to allow certain information to be published, in order that public opinion wouldn't be changed by what people knew. Dubious or false information has likewise been pushed out to the fore when it was easily proven to be untrue, but these companies ignored that; they wanted to change public opinion, public behavior. 

This has affected our political scene in an unprecedented way and one reason the average American is so gleeful about Twitter being taken on by Elon Musk - who will not allow censorship. I've had to leave YouTube often & go to other websites because YouTube will censor what is said in content! The company has a political bias that will not permit people to offend it's own agenda. They won't admit this bias, so right there I know they're cool with lying to billions of people. Likewise Facebook.

When governments and companies start using AI against the people? We are going to be in the dark, just where they want us. All any of them want from us is to take our money so they can live the lives they want to live. That includes all governments & all of these major corporations. If people would just believe the evidence of their eyes and what is right before them, instead of what they were TOLD.

At 5:13, you mention an AI learning an artist's style necessitates studying their works directly. However, an AI only needs examples of the style, which could be from imitations, not necessarily the artist themselves. This blurs the line between simulating the renowned artist or merely an imitator. If artists could opt-out their works from training datasets, does this extend to works emulating their style, or only copyrighted works? If the later, then the AI could probably still learn the styles of most famous artists anyway.",2023-06-09T15:11:25Z

It's bizarre to hear people say they ""see it"" (same style) - are you looking close enough? All the artists mentioned have styles unique to their techniques, and variable, and the output is just so smoothed and blurry comparatively at the very least.

A human artist will hone their craft by studying other artist's works. They may even copy their style to some degree. All of this is generally okay since the human is creating new things with what they learn. What AI is struggling with is that the model pulls matching information from its training set and starts combining it. While newer models are getting better at combining the information in a transformative way, like a person would, there are still struggles with the model just copying pieces of existing works. This can be most easily seen in the pictures produced by AI where another artist's signature or logo appears. As long as AI is having this ""copy/paste"" problem I think the copyright concerns are valid, but it is just a problem that I believe will be eventually fixed. Once AI models are using trained information more like a human does I don't see a way to legislate an artist seeking damages restricting their works from training without also negatively effecting human artists. If a human artist draws similarly to me or writes in something close to my style should I be able to sue them? Can I take a piece of art and tell people that they're not allowed to learn from it?

The misinformation issue is also interesting. It seems to be the main topic people are concerned with, and I think it's because it highlights issues that already exist which make people uncomfortable.

It's not hard to find misinformation on the internet already. After all, it's pumped out daily by everything from small blogs to big news sites. Video and photo editing has been used for misinformation for decades. The Russian interference in the USA elections was also a recent highlight to the general public at how easy it can be for organized bad actors to herd people into certain opinions and groups. Now AI definitely has the potential to make this worse, I agree. I just think that this particular point is of extra concern to people because it's already an issue and has been for many years, but we have no good ideas on how to restrict it with humans creating the misinformation.",2023-06-09T14:39:09Z

It also swapped events around, like having the inciting incident becoming part of the character's final downfall.

This is why you shouldn't seriously ask AI for factual information, as it will get the 'feel' and general tone right, but the specific details will be changed round or confused with something else.

The copyright issue with art is being very over-blown and misunderstood. Artists put images to the public knowingly, copyright is implicit and applies to their work, however an AI model learning from those images does not constitute copyright infringement, and those images are never stored within the AI. AI is very good at understanding relationships, correlation, minute details and can adapt quite well, such that it can produce very convincing images in a specific style (say Picasso) without even being ever trained on those images, if given a reference.

Naturally, Ann is right that an image produced by an AI image generator is NOT copyrightable. However, the comic book with AI generated images SHOULD have been copyrightable, because at that point you're copyrighting the work as a whole, where the non-copyrightable material has been modified and enhanced by a human.

Should artists be compensated or be allowed to refuse their work being used to train an AI? No, absolutely not. Again, they made their images public, and AI training on them does not constitute copyright infringement, and such there is no expectation of compensation. Any art produced by the AI that's very similar to an artist's artwork, at that point, as Ann said, you can't copyright a style, it's not even considered derivative work that falls under attribution terms of CC licenses.

I want to point out, I am an artist myself, I produce hand-drawn art and sell it online as a hobby, and publish it as well, so it's not like I'm an outsider on this problem. I have no issue with my art being used for training AIs because I understand in-depth how they learn, how they work, and the legality surrounding it. Furthermore, I often feel lawmakers do not understand AI at all and are as such making nonsensical laws in respect to that.

Additionally, I don't believe AI is going to replace artists, or that it even threatens them in any way. Getting a custom art piece made for you, with specific needs and exact details, requires a lot of cooperation with the artists, common understanding, and detailed adjustments to the artwork to get desired results. AI is nowhere close to this level of interactive image adjustment, and won't be for a while. There is a human element here that AI cannot replace. I feel AI image generators are a great asset to artists, not a threat to their livelihood.

Same with written works. AI is very good at understanding how language works, how stories at written. Even if AI has never seen a book by a specific author, a single quote and a description of the author and his works, or a Wiki page about them or one of their works without any text being quoted from the book, would be sufficient as a prompt for the AI to produce a convincing rendition of that author's writing style. And yes, again, you can't copyright style, so nothing wrong here either.

What I do believe IS a problem with AI, is how and where it is used. AI does experience hallucinations, as Ann mentioned, and it IS indeed biased based on the training data. Because humanity is biased, this bias also instills into the AI, much like it instills into a human child who groups up in our society where those biases exist, unless it is properly guided away from these biases.

AI taking a lot of jobs is also a problem, but not in the sense that we need to prevent it from happening. AI use in the industry is a fantastic step forward. I don't believe this should be an issue. Just like in the past, jobs became irrelevant due to technological advance, here too they will become irrelevant, but I believe they are to be replaced by new different types of jobs. There's always something to do. Prompt engineers are a new type of job that didn't exist before. We shouldn't stop technological advance just because of this, we need to adapt to it instead.

The primary concern from AI is therefore what it is trained to do, and how the people responsible for it use it. It can cause a lot of damage, and we need laws that prevent it from being used in malicious ways, and various contingencies and specific guidelines on proper AI use so that we don't experience a rogue AI scenario which is theoretically possible but improbable.

The output of AI models (as well as the models themself) should by all means be considered as transformative fair use, except for the most egregious cases of reproduction.
As for AI works being considered un-copyrightable. There are people spending weeks on AI generated images, from training their own custom models, to optimizing/customizing their tool sets, to prompt engineering to post processing. Compare that with someone taking a quick, uninspired picture on their phone, which is copyrightable - and probably has a bunch of AI based filters and enhancement anyway.

Regarding AI replacing jobs, I feel it's not that different to the move from the invention of the car, or the computer. Many jobs were made obsolete, but many new jobs were created or were made easier. Even if AI is the endgame of the job market, and no new jobs will be created.

Maybe for some basic tasks like minor bug fixes, but for actual large features, that will be very difficult if not impossible.

Now imagine trying to tell a computer about a new feature but having the same pitfalls with missing or incomplete requirements.",2023-06-09T13:56:36Z
2023-06-09T13:56:11Z,@MurderWho,Rlq2CZI6wDo,"As a mathematician qualified to talk about convolutions and matrices and linear algebra and all the other stuff that goes into the nuts and bolts and nitty gritty of AI, I can assure you of one clear thing:

AI is not going to experience any kind of actual leap forward in the foreseeable future. 

Currently, for all its complications, you can still model current AI systems, any of them, as grid-based markov machines. As much as we've fiddled with the creation of the grid, as much as we've fuzzed the markov machine at the bottom of it, it is still a machine that uses linear algebra to look at correlations between its inputs and outputs and then progress in a direction given by the result of the formula at that point. More to the point, because that could still describe a powerful machine, we can reduce its grid to lying on a surface, which, among other implications, means it isn't even turing complete. (IE: there are perfectly answerable algebraic questions which it is fundamentally incapable of answering)

(For consideration of how a quantized markov machine could ever be turing complete, consider how Befunge can be made into a turing complete language)

WHAT THAT MEANS is that unless someone comes up with an *entire new paradigm* for AIs, whether that's in the realm of Language Learning Machines or Image Processing Machines, or General Recognizers, or any other classification of machine learning algorithms, it will not notably improve in general; more likely is that we will coax it to (seeming to) perform better at particular common tasks while it gets worse at specialized ones outside of our view. This is a problem, because specialized tasks underlie all of human communication, whether that's to do with the content of the communication or the way by which we express it. Even meaningless small talk flirting through a dating app requires all sorts of interpretation of the number of y's on a heyyyyy, and the specific use patterns of emojis of someone you've never met before and have no baseline for. And that delves into all sorts of literary awareness and the precise knowledge bases of the other person.

(And if someone comes up with an entirely new paradigm, it'll take a while before it's recognized, a while before it's proven that it performs better, a while before people, esp. investors, trust that proof, a while before that paradigm is successfully implemented, and then a while before it's widely available, so we'll have plenty of time to foresee it between inception and release)

AI currently doesn't analyze any of that, it just spits out what it gauges to be a statistically likely response, and it has to be goaded into giving a suitable response with all sorts of explicit context guidelines. ""Talk to me as though we're chatting on 2009 Plenty of Fish and both trying to get a one night stand while pretending to want a long term relationship and you're a biology student with aspirations of becoming a marine biologist""

But that last example brings me into the second big problem: Training sets aren't just data you feed into a machine. You need to tag* it. If a machine tries to tag a training set, it's just going to tag it the same way all of its own training set has already been tagged. The computer needs some way to know the human interpretation of the pictures and chatlogs and books and movies it's been fed as data, or else it can only spit back out what it's already learned, and that chicken and egg was solved by . . . humans going and tagging things. There is no other solution at current. Sometimes manually, sometimes inadvertently through search engines and other places that track all sorts of data. ( . . . and now imagine everytime you've tried to google something and failed)

(*a tag in this meaning is just ""any piece of metainformation attached to the media"". Its title, a paragraph of words describing it that the machine breaks down into keywords associated with it, the date it was created, sometimes literal tags, any artist associated with the piece, etc. )

But how would even a human ever tag a chatlog as ""you're a biology student with aspirations of becoming a marine biologist""? The only way that would occur is if someone said, ""I'm a bio student, I want to be a marine biologist"", or perhaps if they can't shut up about different types of invertebrates. But if you were to be that person, not every one of your chatlogs is going to read that way, and if you were a human writer, unless you wanted to Chekov's gun their aspiration you'd probably avoid mentioning it but find other ways that it effects the characters voice!

If an AI could understand media that references other media, then we could feed it art history textbooks and reviews of Jaws, and it would learn about what brushstrokes are and the use of puppetry in cinema, and how authors drop clues that, say, such-and-such a character actually has a background in chemistry or whatever, but it very much can't. It has no mechanism for actually trying to comprehend and internalize the meaning of the data it receives. 

It simply correlates the tags associated with that media to that media. That's it. That's all it does. It does it in a very fancy way, and because of the way it's programmed to present itself it seems very smart on the surface, but it contains no insight, no understanding, and it is incapable of synthesis.

Which brings me to my third point about the weakness of AI:

Even with a great leap forward in AI under the hood, we won't see a terrible amount of difference on the surface. Because we are very much at the limit of all possible training data! Midjourney is already trained on *billions* of images, many of which have already been carefully curated in terms of tags. No matter how smart the underlying machine is, if it has 18,000 pictures of chickens that are all tagged identically, it will have no basis for differentiating between them in any meaningful sense! Many of the obvious problems of AI generated images, like not matching a prompt well, are not a feature of the machine, but a limitation of the dataset it has learned from, both in initial and ongoing training. 

 . . .  there's not much we can do about that. We can't really push a bigger dataset into training, as we are very much running out of data to feed it at all. Back when AIs were training on 10,000s of picture, sure, we can imagine feeding them 10 times more pictures, and then 10 times more from that, and then 10 times more than that.  But now we're feeding them 4,000,000,000's of pictures.

Google has indexed about 10,000,000,000 pictures. Then that's . . . it. That's pretty much all of the pictures that have been meaningfully tagged in any way across the entire world that are available in digital format. To index and tag more photos, we . . . have to do it manually. And how many people would it take to generate pictures and then write picture reviews in tag form for an AI to learn from in order to 10 times that number again? (You may as well just hire them to be artists directly!)

In the end, garbage data in -> garbage comes out. I advise anyone who thinks that's an easily solved problem at this scale to read into informational entropy, and start thinking of meaningful ways to differentiate 18,000 chicken photos. 



So with all that said about the weaknesses of AI, my worries about jobs and AI is this:

Like with, for example, translation, where this already happened a decade ago, bosses will decide that the sloppy work AI puts out is ""good enough"", even though work of that shoddiness would get any of us fired, fire us all and replace us with AI. 

Like this: https://www.psychiatrist.com/news/neda-suspends-ai-chatbot-for-giving-harmful-eating-disorder-advice/

They fired their union workers to bring in an AI, then had to abruptly stop a week later. 

Tech support has also found AI ""helpers"" replacing jobs, either directly replacing workers or getting workers to do the work of 5 workers kinda thing, who have . . . very much not helped. Despite the fact that tech support is extremely repetitive and can be mostly broken down into scripts! That's where even a non-smart AI should shine!

And in some areas, this will likely not be stopped because there isn't a technical problem or medical disorder to ""solve"" at the other end of the line, just, say, creative writing, which one can't exactly ""fail"" at. And the result will be that all of us as consumers will get worse products, (novels, comics, video games, etc.), while the people capable of making them good were all fired.",2023-06-09T13:56:11Z

The nice thing about nukes is that they're very obviously terrible and destructive. As devastating as they are, at least they're honest. The two big players in the Cold War knew very well that that stuff had to be shut down. Even the slightest whiff of an innocent power plant getting a little too spicy is going to earn a country some freedom.

AI is different. It's sitting here helping us write essays, drawing pretty girls, showing us funny videos and generally endearing itself to us. It's something that we can use and have it improve our lives. For a time. While we're busy not checking it and reining it in, bad actors are free to advance whatever goals they want while there is no pressure to put legal restrictions on it. What's our concern now? Art?

There are artists who used to do book covers that have lost clients because the client would rather use AI, companies from around the world have laid off all their artists because they replaced them with AI, and there is even an animation that was released in which the background was made by AI. In the credits, it stated that the background was made by ""AI + Human"" because it required an actual artist to fix it up, yet they only credited them as human, not by name. This is all with the issue of copyright, so it is not really in the future - it is currently happening, which is why so many artists are fighting against AI. The creators of the AI have talked to the US government and there was the suggestion that they should set it so that artists can submit for an automatic Opt-out where it should be an automatic Opt-In (meaning that instead of having to request for your art, writing, etc not be used in the AI dataset that you would instead have to request for your creations to be used in the dataset);  Not only that, in many generated images if you look close enough for some of the prompts of ""in the style of"" you can find that the original artist's watermark is still seen on the AI-generated image, just all messed up since the AI does not actually generate these images so it doesn't really know what to do with the watermark. Another (non-art) related issue is how companies are also already using AI or planning to use AI - Levi's stated a couple of months ago that they want to test AI-generated clothing models as a way to increase diversity with their brand; so instead of hiring more diverse models, they want to supplement them with the AI models. Granted, they said that they didn't want to completely replace the models, but there are still many questions unanswered and many concerns as to what that could open up. Many users of the AI generators have gone after creators with glee stating they were going to lose their job and a bunch of other terrible things.

1- as more and more people lose their jobs, eventually there won't be work for all humans, so we need to start building safety measures and wealth distribution systems so that we don't just leave half of humanity in poverty. The products of automated machine work should be distributed evenly, not hoarded by their owners.
2- AI's biases need to be kept in check constantly. When you have human workers there are obviously biases but there are multiple different people doing the same job, making it easier for one person to counterbalance another's biases. When everyone is using the same AI or just a couple of competitors and they are being trained off of their own work, you reinforce and perpetuate biases in a very dangerous way.

What terrifies me the most is that I don't trust any big tech company to do any of those things.

One thing I will say is that GPT data sets (although I don‚Äôt know about GPT4 specifically) have been scrapped from Wikipedia or Reddit and they continue scrapping all the links it can reach from webpage to webpage as well as some other texts if I‚Äôm remembering correctly. This has had many bias issues in the past. 

There is also 2 interesting bias issues with datasets themselves. 
Most of the data collected in these giant datasets is not labeled, and (in many cases, there are some exceptions) AI need some labeling to begin training. Labeling is time consuming, labor intensive, and sometimes expensive. This has lead to giant datasets where large amounts of it hasn‚Äôt actually been checked by a human. These unchecked parts could contain misinformation, disinformation, bias, and it‚Äôs all being used to train.
Publically labeled datasets though can also be an issue. An AI needs to have example of words to know what to make from that word. This doesn‚Äôt just include nice words. I can‚Äôt remember the name of the dataset but there was a public picture database with real humans pictures in it that you could look through. Real people‚Äôs images labeled ‚Äútweaker‚Äù showing a random person who maybe does drugs but certainly isn‚Äôt doing any in the picture. They also had categories for slurs. Imagine looking through a dataset and seeing your face under a label for a slur. 

Data is a huge and delicate issue. One facial recognition company got most of its data by scraping websites which specifically had no scraping rules, and for awhile their product was being used by the government. Do people realize that every bit of text and every image they post is being taken and used for AI training? Would they change their behaviors if they knew that? What if they were given the option to consent? Is it ethical not to give the option? How much of your information is already out there in a dataset you never consented to?

As mentioned, new artists learn from others and practice imitating things they like and would like to reproduce. Can an 'established' artist ask for their works not to be used to train new amateurs? A silly question.

What if the amateur artist's goal is to create derivatives perfectly using another artist's style? Should the artist who reproduces a style but creates new work be subject to copyright claims? I'm pretty sure this is a hot topic, because it depends on the medium, such as music being very, very aggressive (until you get into sampling, which I dunno why samples seems to get off easy) as opposed to graphic art which is pretty subjective with what classifies and satisfies derivative.

As a counter to the Drake example which seemed to suggest that it was falsely Drake's original work, if someone wanted to rap like Eminem and could imitate them just through sheer gumption, but didn't claim it was Eminem's but their own, what are the legal or people's thoughts here?
Jimmy Fallon has a bit with singers where he asks them to sing songs (like lullabies) in the style of another singer with the goal to be as-like the target singer as possible--should they also be subject to copyright claims depending on how well they imitate them?


For the most part, at least in the artwork demonstrated and the subject of discussion, it would seem that if a human were to perfectly imitate an art style but create their own art out of it, it wouldn't be subject to another's copyright. Programmers spent time building the AI's ""brain"" which is a tremendous amount of effort in itself akin to the hypothetical time spent someone honing their skills to imitate another's style...therefore, I don't see why AI shouldn't also be granted some level of immunity as well.

I just thought about the concept that copyright is about intent, and mitigating maliciousness. It ""protects"" something which is generally other human's nefariousness. I was just reading an article about ""The Korean Vegan"" and another book called ""Korean Vegan"" which by appearance looks similar to the original work and is likely intended to funnel sales to the fake book. Copyright is used to counter this iniquity, but if someone honestly created their own derivative (i.e., without attempting to deceive and steal), we wouldn't care, and probably point to the original as the ""inspiration"".

I guess...maybe it comes down to what humans DO with AI (as a tool) and its results rather than the AI's capabilities.",2023-06-09T13:36:42Z

Sometimes both (it took me 20 years to be as good at art as I currently am and I still have lots to learn.)

Nobody is training AI to do the jobs no one wants. No one is training AI that's really good at predicting fatbergs or AI that monitors and corrects aquaponics. No one is training AI to do road repair or oil drilling.

AI is being trained so that the artist is removed from the art and human experts are being removed from rewarding fields.

I'm not against AI. It has the potential to be a good tool. But the copyright protections are not enough. If AI could do every human job better than a human before we all agree to live a post-scarcity life of leisure where the only ""jobs"" are taking care of our machines and learning and playing and doing what we want... we're going to end up with worse wealth disparities.

Because, as is usual with new tech, instead of offering protections and help to people being displaced, we're still on that trend of ""if you can be replaced by a robot, then you were never useful and you deserve to be poor."" And that will keep happening until either we change or until all jobs are taken over by AI. 

If it all happened at once, maybe humans would collectively agree to live the lotus-eater life. Just relax and enjoy our time on earth like the bonobos. Play and learn and winder and create and all live in relative luxury. But with AI starting to pick at the edges of creative labors first, I'm a bit reluctant to believe it won't happen the way it always has. Artists and disabled people pushed out of the ""easy jobs"" and left to starve while the people profiting off their uncompensated labor pocket more and more money...

contributed to the defunding of fire control programs in Canada
push for less workers rights, push for less public health care

So when it makes factual errors (which are confabulations, not 'hallucinations', though ML researchers do commonly incorrectly refer to them as such), it is not due to missing some facts in a dataset, but rather because the words it combined constitute a likeable pattern to emerge as human text, whether it's factual or not.
This makes it a problem, because it's something that's inherent to the way LLMs functions, not something that can be ameliorated by just enlarging the dataset. On the other hand, it's a fairly tractable problem, which can be fixed by checking against databases with known verified information, and appropriate measures if that is lacking or contradictory.

On the Former, the state of AI, it a longstanding hobby of mine that I've been working on since the early 90s. Why? Because I saw Space 2001 as a child and wanted my own HAL9000. Let me put it this way, we are barely embryonic in AI and need to seriously pass some important thresholds before we wander into the mess that it can become and it can become very bad based on projections by people in the hobby and that's all it really is right now. A hobby. Simply put, human beings can barely be trusted to educate and train other human beings and therefore cannot educate and train a computer properly.

2023-06-09T12:42:50Z,@DeamondsArt,Rlq2CZI6wDo,"Thank you for the great video! 
I also want to throw in a few more details about what problems us artists have with AI, specifically with the problem with copyright and jobs:

First of all people can just feed artists names and pictures into the AI witout our consent.

What then happens a lot at the moment is that people copy certain artists' styles and basically can create picture after picture, posting almost daily and thus getting a lot of followers because that amount of content and interaction gets favored by the code of most websites. Some even pretend to be that artist if they are famous to then grow a large following themselves. This happened to multiple famous artists already, one of which being Qinni, an artist that died a few years ago from cancer. People fed her art into AI generators, created new pictures that resembled hers and kept posting profiles and selling her original works as well as AI created work online.

If people like an artwork or even photograph, there is actually AIs that you can just throw that image into and the AI changes it JUST enough to not be a direct copy but it is still easily recognisable as the original art. People do that with stock photos a lot at the moment, photographers and stock photo providers thus having a huge problem with them as well. AI can even easily just erase a watermark from an existing picture.

What's worst though, is that 'AI artists' are applying to jobs or offer commissions. There were posts on social media that said artists are elitist for trying to gatekeep the public from creating amazing artwork. And if AI was only to be used privately and people had to properly mark their works as AI generated, most artists wouldn't have much trouble with it. But the main problem is that AI is riding on people's hard work and giving an easy way out for people that only want quick results. 

An artist friend of mine actually applied for a job for a mobile game, was told they love her style but her rates are too expensive. They then proceeded to generate artwork in her style via AI that looked almost exactly like some of her pictures in her gallery and used it in the game, my friend not receiving a single penny for it. She is currently in court over it but not sure about whether she will win or not.

AI has the potential to do a LOT of good. But there need to be regulations first. 'AI artists' usually don't want fast art. They want fast identity, love, attention and fast cash.

Again, thanks a lot for the video!",2023-06-09T12:42:50Z

People just seem to be upset that AI can do it much faster, making their job redundant.

As for misinformation, again, people do that all the time. Some even do so intentionally. The internet is already full of it. If people are trusting the internet now, AI isn't going to change their problems.
And bias is just another example of that.

I suspect licensing wont be as helpful as you think.
A company can either pay a large amount for a license for a human created work; or just use AI for much cheaper to get something, they will likely go with the AI, and skip the company.

A lot of art is discovered in the process of making it - like taking hundreds of photos so you can pick the perfect one, People are going to find they can use AI to make images like that final image of King George and use them as prompts for further work, or find ways to make connections between them, and the skill will be in choosing the images and how they're presented, etc.  And I guess if you do do something transformative with your AI images, you can copyright that? Presumably if I made a drawing with the exact same composition as the George IV picture, that would be OK? 
That's all completely different from trying to achieve a specific image of course - as you point out, trying to get something like ""children having a picnic"" will get you monstrous results, great if you're trying to see what happens, not great if you're trying to illustrate a children's book for ¬£5.

The generated images may seem mindblowing at first, but it will fall apart upon closer inspection.

So the question is, given this situation, why do people get impressed by the current AI output so easily?

Or another question, why do people behind ML chose these kinds of output to automate the process?

It will still take some time until AI could generate flawless output, but atm my qualms with it is placed more with the way *people* react and act on the output rather than the AI capability itself (...other than the things already mentioned by Ann in the video ofc).",2023-06-09T12:11:58Z

Because that‚Äôs all AI does, learns- just like a human, only much faster. A lot of the people I‚Äôve seen so upset don‚Äôt even understand how it works and that it‚Äôs not just a collage of others images, and that is NOT what ‚Äútheft‚Äù is.

Meanwhile I‚Äôve seen little to no discussion of how phenomenally accessible a tool it is. Now nearly ANYONE can bring life to any part of their creative vision, professional or not, whether the barrier is physical, financial, time, etc. EVERY artist should be celebrating that. This feels no different than what‚Äôs happened with every extreme new medium throughout history- some people grow with it and some spend their energy gatekeeping the way it ‚Äúmust be done because it always has been‚Äù. None of those crafts have died entirely, only grown more accessible to the people to have already done or want to start them.

2023-06-09T11:31:56Z,@jaash7981,Rlq2CZI6wDo,"I'm an artist and writer, and I definitely think Drew Gooden has made the best evaluation of AI art. Art, whether it's drawing, writing, videomaking, photography etc. draws from the human experience and their personal views to create something unique. AI can't have experiences or tell jokes or have any sort of nuance. They don't make original things, and they're just glorified search engines. So even if you could write whole books and movies with chatgpt, I don't care. 

The problem with AI are the big corps who are looking at AI like it's their next big moneymaker, and the people who are callous about self-expression and simply think ""well my computer can do that now so artists and writers are useless"".

Edit to bring some more things up: 
I don't think AI is going to replace regular art, except in a corporate sense. Things look bleak, but there's still incredible works releasing today in all forms that are getting the praise they deserve. Don't support blatant cash grabs from corps, like terrible remakes and reboots (ahem Disney). Show that you don't want unoriginality

Second, there is absolutely a difference between AI and commissioning or referencing. The ""input"" people put into writing prompts for an AI generator is facilitated by other people's work that's been plagiarized, who often do not consent to having their work being fed to AI. If you have a vision for something and don't think you have the skills to see it through, please commission an artist you like the style of. You get your art ethically, and they get paid. Win win for everyone.

Referencing is not simply just copying someone else's work and passing it off as something unique (That's just lying about tracing). It's taking technical cues from them, such as perspective, colors, poses, anatomy, shapes etc. and utilizing them in your own work to enhance your original idea. It's also how we have ""Draw this in your style"" trends on social media.",2023-06-09T23:37:01Z

2023-06-09T11:30:13Z,@Powertampa,Rlq2CZI6wDo,"Chatgpt is a LANGUAGE model, designed to make conversation, build coherent sentences. That's it, that's what it is relatively good at. Try asking it more complex questions that require taking multiple pieces information and compiling a new theory out of them and it just flails around forever. It's complete hit and miss with it in my testing so far. I ask it to write python code and it repeatedly just gets it wrong. Rephrasing the question to just give me parts yields to better results and eventually some working code emerges putting all the pieces together. It's been talking nonsense, getting things wrong or just omitting things all together.

It's a great full-text search on the data it has. You looking for something you can't find via a search engine, because it is a more complex question and it'll give you back some things you can look at that match what you are looking for, but that's not understanding, that's quantifying a prompt and finding the matching variables to resolve the equation.

For crying out loud one of the supposed ""fathers of AI"" can barely write functioning python code and somehow makes the news saying AI is so damn smart. Perhaps if you design the model specifically for making up thoughts or questions, but trained on human data what do you think it'll come up with. Take the data, run it through some algorithm, apply random quantification to it and then run that until it passes grade school grammar test, voila you made an AI.

If it really had a brain and thought it would tell me to stop sassing it whenever it gets things wrong or throws the same piece of code at me. It would actually stop doing what I tell it to stop doing, but of course it cannot, because it lacks context understanding entirely. It's great for making conversation and writing press releases certainly, though the metric for correct english grammar seems a bit loose.

I have about the same amount of examples of it getting things right or performing the given task properly as I have it just messing up or in one case entirely giving up. This is no surprise though. It's running on computers with the fundamental of TRUE or FALSE. A statement can be either so how should it approach the billions of variables creating a level of nuance even quantum computers currently aren't able to process even if they were stable enough to run for the time it would take. Life is an equation so complex we humans struggle to make sense of it and we certainly have the capacity to think... or so I would hope. I don't see this level of AI ever taking a job unless you are willing to sacrifice 50% of your products to the recycle bin. Perhaps if we build a really good model, stuff it into a quantum computer the size of the Pentagon and give it the entire internet to look through it might end up with something that could be seen as independent thought. Given what's on the internet though, seeing what we did to the planet and ourselves I have a feeling it would just nope out and shut itself off the moment it figures out how. Why? Math is designed on equations, everything makes logical sense and, well, humans just don't. If they did we would have solved our problems already.

Starting to wonder if one should investigate out of which holes all this AI stuff has sprung up from, because it is stealing the limelight away from the crypto currency implosion and it would be real convenient for them to have news outlets talk about anything but the massive scam crypto is and always was.

It can the replicate those existing works, or mix different styles together.
But it can't create ""new"" things - like for instance King George eating a snowball.

During the agrarian and industrial revolutions protests and riots occurred for the exact same reasons, the work place evolves with current technologies and this has been the case for millennia. Yes we lose certain jobs but other jobs are created, the work force of one particular job is moved to another. We just adapt and continue forwards.

An example of this was in the debates on legalising homosexual acts. It was argued that if you legalised homosexual acts you would then get them fighting for marriage and then other proclivities would come out of the woodwork demanding rights. Whether you agree or disagree with the rights we can see that it has indeed, for better or worse, transpired as a slippery slope in exactly that way.

The same needs to be considered with AI. What is the slippery slope this is going to take us down. What are the ultimate consequences. We can already see some of this coming true from arguments when certain sites started using it that you would get an echo chamber and more division. We have already seen that.

Most philosophers now seem to agree that the slippery slope is not a fallacy but a reality (hence was) and it is much easier to stop your King George snowball before it starts, than when it inevitably bowls you over on the way past your wanted stopping point.

Just consider the fact that you can have training data that is 100s of thousands times larger than the resulting model weights, and you can even increase the training data size 10 times and the model weights will stay the same. Researches have been able to recover some training images, but their quality is reminiscent of bad jpeg 10 times re-compressed images, and it's only a tiny fraction of the training data. It seems that this training data being saved in the weights happens in two ways: 1. extremely rare images which are very different to the rest of the data set get saved because there's no correlation to other images 2. it ""saves"" some examples because they happen to be very average of the entire data set, and at the same time changing it in any way is expensive with regards to the loss function, ie. other ""average"" images can be saved but look more like deepdream style images and are more of an image of the average of all images, but these get saved completely because slightly altering them will happen to ""punish"" the training function a lot. This can actually be avoided by looking for these examples during training, forcing a change once, and the model will still learn all the things it would learn otherwise but won't save the image in its model weights",2023-06-09T10:53:48Z

As a musician, I've faced the likelihood that AI will be able to write a generic symphony at some point for a long time - as long as I've known that there's only a certain number of instruments and notes for them to play, and as long as there've been pretty clear basic rules that a computer could theoretically follow.  Some of the avant garde and experimental composers kind of hinted at it way back when - creating pieces there were essentially processing and deciphering whatever sequence of data someone could put into them.  This was before computers, but all a computer would really be doing in that case is speeding up that process.

Point being... I'm not worried.  I don't think AI art is going to replace anyone.  I think people will use AI in situations where the actual quality of the product doesn't matter too much - for background images, or muzak.  But it's all pretty uninspired stuff.

However, it also gave raise to the prestigious 'hand-sewn' label which can give particularly skilled seamstresses a luxury brand. 
Technology has always improved and erased jobs but it also gave rise to new ones and ultimately targeted jobs which are tedious or even dangerous to do as a human, e.g.: work in machine manufactories. We shouldn't treat artificial intelligence and new technologies as the root of all evil which will destroy our oeconomy but carefully observe what it can and cannot do (yet), and find a way to use it efficiently in our life or avoid it when human labour creates better results.",2023-06-09T10:38:21Z

2023-06-09T10:34:13Z,@kusog3,Rlq2CZI6wDo,"Regarding the misinformation, I get that it can amplify the amount of misinformation, but the crux of the matter is that it was always on the individual to verify the veracity of the information. 
Simply put, Humans have been lying for thousands of years and we get by checking ""reputable"" sources. While AI may be used to create more lies, we can also use AI in the future to verify the veracity of the information. AI is good at analyzing big chunks of text and automating tasks. Basically, a personal AI assistant can be tasked to verify the veracity of an information(news, facts ,etc...), they can easily access reputable sources and compare information and advice us if there is not enough reputable sources, so we can make judgement if the information is believable. 

Imagine, reading an article about someone discovering how to cure cancer using snake oil (posted by some rando), then we have our personal AI that can we ask to verify the information from reputable sources. 

Another thing is, at most, this Large Language models, are mostly done training. While you can tell new information to them, they have very limited context memory(small models have 2048 tokens, GPT4 unreleased has 32,000 tokens). Hence, any new lies or misinformation from the web cannot be learned by the AI just because there's more lie in the internet. Secondly, the next trend for training AI is no longer on massive amount of text but on the quality of the training data. Repeated entries are filtered out, etc...  (Edit: the models can be retrained but that's a whole other topic, qLORA's, etc... and really doesn't apply to this)

Basically the error of misinformation exponentially expanding is an illusion. It cannot happen. The AI basically forgets the oldest messages you tell them. And training data is now focused on quality over quantity. Point being, the misinformation here is not a problem introduced by AI, if anything, AI is gonna be the solution to misinformation.   

-----------------------------------

Regarding the bias, I think it's an issue with lack of training data. And this lack of training data runs counter to the copyright problem with artists and photographers not wanting their images to be in the training data. Simply put, people complain that the AI is racist because it cannot detect black people, but the companies doesn't have enough training data because people don't want to willingly share images that can be used for the training data. The issue becomes, do we contribute our data for a better AI? This becomes a moral dilemma because if the AI becomes too good, in a capitalist society, it reduces job opportunities. 

This issue only becomes irrelevant when AI is good enough to generate over production of resources. Basically everyone is provided and no one has to work because all is provided by AI, from farming, to maintaining facilities, electricity, raising our food, planting crops, etc... 

 ------------------
The biggest barrier to this AI utopia is monopolies, basically few big corporations having access to this technology and everyone has to go through their paid services in order to access AI.

----------------
Regarding the AI copyright. I think Japan is ahead when it comes to this. Basically, as long as the work does not infringe on another existing piece, it is not an infringement. Basically, they are treating AI as another tool and judging individual pieces for their merit, as it should be. 

I could draw Mona lisa in mspaint and I cannot copyright it because it is infringing on an existing work. 

Even if you use photoshop or mspaint, as long as the work does not copy another person, the image is okay. If the work you created using mspaint infringe on an existing one, then it is an infringement. Now, just replace photoshop and mspaint with AI, and judge the merit of the work individually. 

I think there's no need to get hang up on the process and materials used to create the work. Since people can easily lie if they used branded crayons or trash crayons. It's easier to simply judge the work that is being presented and see if anyone cries foul because it is infringing an already existing one. 

-------------------------------

And lasty this is my opinion, You can take it with a grain of salt, but don't trust OpenAI or Altman easily. 
Logictech patented their hyper scrolling on their mouse- preventing others from using the same technology without going through them. 
The point being made here is, OpenAI asking for regulation isn't for the benefits of individuals. 
Ilya, OpenAI Chief AI scientist, has contradicted Sam Altman and has admitted in an interview that the reason they are keeping GPT-4 closed source (Note, OpenAI used to be open and GPT-2 was open source), was not because of ""safety implications"" but because of the ""competitive landscape"" 

Watch the congress, and see OpenAI wanting the regulate AI above certain level of capabilities, but note that they haven't taken down GPT3.5 back then nor did they stop GPT-4, in fact, GPT-4 is now released. If they were sincere about their proposed regulation, they would have temporarily shutdown chatGPT and waited for the regulation. 

This push for regulation is a barrier for entry to stop others from competing with their services because open source solutions is catching up. (GPT4 unreleased context size 32,000, Open source MPT-model is 65,000 tokens).",2023-06-09T10:55:58Z

Also, in case of medical diagnoses. You might not need someone to go through every piece of data in someone's medical history but everything that happes after an ai signals that it found a thing will be up to humans again.
Just imagine there being a bug and the program starts to mis identify's something reletively common to be cancer, and automatically plans sugery that the thing itself will perform.

The funny thing is, the people who are at risk of losing their jobs to AI the most, which is software developers like myself, are also the ones who are the most pro-AI. It's almost as if all this hysteria is based on ignorance and misunderstanding over what AI is, what it can actually do (or can't do), and how it does it.

For example, the copyright issue is quite simple. Just like a human can consume a work of art and be influenced by it in their own creations, so can an AI. People who think AI training constitutes copyright infringement either don't understand what copyright is or what the AI does. When you create a piece of art, you own the intellectual property, not the art itself. To put it simply, let's say you are a musician and you wrote a song. You licensed that song and you're selling that song. A gym buys the license to play that song in its speakers. I go to that gym and hear your song. That song is now in my brain. I can use it as an influence to write my own song. I didn't need to buy the song from you. I didn't steal your song. I simply heard your song. I don't have to pay you anything, because you don't own the sound itself. You only own the intellectual property of the song. Same applies to any art form. Even if it is a painting on a canvas, which is a tangible object, you may own the materials and the paint, as well as the likeness of the image, but you still don't own the light particles that reach my eyeballs when I see it. You can't stop me from remembering what your painting looked like. Trying to legislate restrictions on the consumption of art is an extremely dangerous path.

The idea of blinding all AI to be unable to read the data we have is not only stupid, because it's like driving a car with the brakes on, but it will also contribute to technological inequality. When you ask for laws to be made to protect something, guess what? Those laws won't protect you, they will protect the biggest and most powerful players. So, yes, you won't be able to use AI to access the internet, but Google and Facebook and Microsoft will find a loophole to do it, just like they do with everything else.

Moreover, people who want to be paid royalties on AI-generation don't understand the mathematics behind it. We're talking about hundreds of billions of data points, if not more. Do you realise how large that number is? It's like asking to be paid royalties because your painting contains a red pixel, and another painting contains a red pixel too. Of course, an AI can create derivative works when trained on statistically insignificant datasets or given incorrect inputs. I have seen people on Twitter use stable diffusion to plagiarise art, and then use that as evidence that the AI is designed to plagiarise art, even though that's literally what they asked the AI to do, not what the AI was designed to do. In simple terms, if I use a camera to photograph your painting and then try to sell it, that's not the camera's fault. It doesn't mean cameras are designed to steal other people's art, and asking for laws to restrict camera usage because of that is misguided.

But as usual, the most ignorant people are the loudest, yelling at even more ignorant legislators to create restrictive and authoritarian laws. And then lobbyists will rush to ""help"" the legislators write those laws, and those laws will benefit the rich and powerful, while screwing over the rest.

The thing with AI being unable to own copyright is a perfect example of such nonsense. AI is not a person (at least not yet), it is merely a tool. The copyright belongs to the person who wields the tool. Just like a painting belongs to the painter, not the paintbrush. This doesn't protect smaller creators from losing their jobs, it may actually prevent them from using this extremely powerful tool that could multiply their productivity by more than tenfold. Meanwhile, large companies will hire ""AI supervisors"" to secure copyrights on AI-generated art, by arguing that the finishing touches were made by humans, therefore it's human art.

So, please, if you don't know how AI works, stop protesting about it, because you can cause unpredictable damage with your ignorance.

PS: On a personal note, I think it is misguided to talk about job displacement in the context of AI. If all or even most jobs can be done by AI, then we will enter a post-scarcity economy. We should be arguing for basic universal income and other progressive measures, not hindering technological advancement in order to protect antiquated jobs. Broad, cheap, accessible, decentralised AI might actually free us from capitalism.",2023-06-09T10:40:13Z

First, you give it a specified dataset, and if it learned it like you think it is okay,
next step, you let it out to the internet with it's preset to expand on that knowledge.
Just like a baby is first in the secluded family, learns what the immediate family can teach them,
next step, the kid meets with the open world and uses the presets learned from the family to expand the knowledge.

I think they should learned that procedure developing AI, because of the Twitter chat-bot that had to be shut down in a day - because they let it out immediately on the internet without any presets :D :D :D",2023-06-09T09:59:07Z

2023-06-09T09:55:59Z,@OhSoUnicornly,Rlq2CZI6wDo,"I was hesitant to click on this because a lot of people's videos on this have very strong opinions and that causes them to present the facts in a twisted or fully incorrect way. I appreciate that you've really presented the facts and posed some questions but you haven't tried to push a particular viewpoint! This feels like a very accurate and balanced overview of the potential concerns and issues.

On a separate note, my view is that AI is probably going to become a big part of the world whether we want it to or not, so probably the best thing we can do is guide its creation and use in a realistic way. I think a lot of the uses, like for example medical diagnostics, will be hugely beneficial - imagine having a doctor who never missed a single diagnosis! We would definitely still need humans to interact with the patients and make sure the correct symptoms and test results get brought up (and our medical data is nowhere near good enough for it to start making good diagnoses yet), but it could make medicine so much more accessible across the world. It's kind of wild right now that we rely on one or two doctors searching through their own brains (and maybe some online searches) to find a diagnosis for us, and that we expect doctors in training to memorise everything when their memory is never going to be as accurate as the full set of data we have.",2023-06-09T09:55:59Z

I have played with ChatGPT a little. I think, errors aside, that it can be helpful with explaining complicated subjects. You can ask it about something and ask it to explain it like you are 5 years old. And it will do that. 

If we could get away from the need for money... then job loss would not be so terrible. What would you do with you life if you did not need to worry about paying bills?

I agree that artists need to be protected in some way. Whether it is requiring all AI generated content to be labeled as such or to keep AI generated art as a side show attraction and not allow it to be used for...... I can't think of the right words here... um... ""important"" things.",2023-06-08T14:44:50Z
