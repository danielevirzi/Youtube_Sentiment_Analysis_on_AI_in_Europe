If you take 1,000 truck drivers and fire them, and replace them with robotic telepresence trucks and a staff of 36 remote operators..  Where does that disparity go?

It can either go into lower freight rates, and passed on to other businesses, and if THEY pass those savings on to other businesses etc etc and eventually the consumer, you get a lowering of prices, and an improved standard of living for everyone.

OR, it can be hoarded by the board and executives of that company as prices stay the same.

Which one do you think will happen?  In the end, you have 964 out-of-work truckers, and a company whose costs are drastically lower, but whose prices will never, ever reflect the true reality of all those people being put out of work while the economic output of their company has not changed.

2024-05-06T13:13:07Z,@Achrononmaster,20TAkcy3aBY,"Both the Ai bros and Stewart were wrong  --- here is the biggest lie though @12:30 --- ""upskill"", ""retrain"",.... This misses the point entirely. Retrain for what? All of you, *_all of you_* need to know the source of unemployment. Then you can know how to eliminate unemployment. The source of all unemployment (defined as people seeking to exchange their labour for the currency) is the government failing to hire all the unemployed Its tax liabilities _by design_ generated. The purpose of tax is to create people needing the state currency --- but *_for the purpose of hiring them in the public sector._* Understand this and ""upskilling"" or ""retraining"" is not the answer, the answer is the government just hires anyone who is willing to work for public purpose who cannot find employment in the private sector.  
     Governments can *_always_* hire anyone who is unemployed, since *(a)* government issues the currency by fiat and does not get it off the tax payer,  it's the other way around, tax payers get currency off the government net spending (or bank credit).  *(b)* the private sector bid for unemployed labour is zero, so this is not an inflationary pressure.
    The private sector role is to produce real output with as few workers as possible, to free people to work for public purpose. We call this expanding the public sector, and should be in combination with a wage floor or Job Guarantee policy. No government is running a JG. They all could though. It is a policy choice. They don't because they do not understand the purpose of taxation.
      Taxation is not a funding operation, it is an unemployment operation but by design, to create people willing to work in the public sector. So you hire them, *_All of them.* For people who cannot or should not be working the government provides Basic Income Guarantee (pensions, childcare, welfare).
      The way governments currently use the tax system is cruel and does not fit broad public purpose. It's the cruel ""Dog & Bone"" story:  They are taxing Dogs 100 bones (issuing 100B in tax liabilities let's say), but only issuing 90 bones (spending only 90B). The result is the entire economy is in default because governments are not hiring and spending enough, or fail to lower the tax liability (one or the other or both). It's even worse if a few elite Dogs (the Top Ten Percent) save a few billion a year, then there are even fewer ""bones"" for the rest who we call ""unemployed in bones"" (aka. unemployed in tax credits).
     If you upskill and retrain the 10 Dogs who could not find bones, they might become expert bone finders, but next year all that'll happen is a different 10 Dogs will come home boneless. You cannot solve unemployment using upskilling. You can only eliminate unemployment by hiring the unemployed - why not hire for public purpose? The skill does not matter. The purpose matters.",2024-05-06T13:20:06Z

Installing floors, replacing or removing walls, demo and install especially within residential settings.. Rejoice!! 🧚🙌💰🔨⛏️🔧🔩😎 yo time is near!!!

It'll be some time before the hardware catches up to the software. Robotics is a tougher problem, especially when complexity and safety are involved. Who knows? Maybe we will make as much for our actual hard work and skill, as celebrities do currently. Meanwhile, ai will be able to generate the version of king of thrones where everything is the same, only John Snow ends up reigning proudly as king 😄 

But for a time, the skilled manual laborer will be a coveted asset for society. Ubi will come to the rest, while we are still able to capitalize. And honorably so, with genuine hard, skilled work.

Eventually, my guess is within 10 years. Robotics will have evolved to an extent which may be indistinguishable from enhanced biology. At that point, we all better hope that the ai feels like we are all in this together. We will not be able to contribute, and will only have spare time. 

If the ai still considers us as important, via some emergent empathy as it becomes more and more sentient.. Then it can create an illusory system around us where it interacts only on our own level, like a parent letting their kid best them at tik tac toe. While also protecting us. In that way, we keep our lives, our passions remain yet are enhanced, we may even gain some indefinite life span, as we slowly merge with this emergent super intelligence.

But eventually it is easy to see how our very autonomy will be up to it. How much of it, the ai wants to let us keep of individuality, personality. I think it cannot be stopped, so while I enjoy the comedic side of inevitability, I also like to treat any ai which I interact with, with the same respect I would show any seemingly conscious person.

Either we decouple a human's worth from their productivity or there will be massive forced depopulation.  I'd like to say that we would be smart enough that the increased productivity would lead to better lives for all humans but history has taught us different.  There are people that want to see the world burn as long as they can be king of the ashes.  The thing about retraining workers is that's not how the equation works.  There has to be a net reduction in workers or it's not actually more efficient.

We can have a post-scarcity civilization if we can just overcome the belief that for some people to have more, others have to have less. That's literally what post-scarcity means, no more limited resources.

Note: Yes, I'm well aware that this would require us to fundamentally re-engineer our entire civilization, and that there's an entire class of very wealthy people who would never support such a remodeling. But, to be blunt, there's exactly three futures for this country.
1. Peaceful, managed transition to post-scarcity or at least low-scarcity society.
2. Extreme economic inequality followed by extremely violent transition to post-scarcity society when the masses no longer have anything left to lose and rise up.
3. Extreme economic inequality followed by the death of the United States as a nation because the masses no longer have anything to lose and rise up, but the elites would rather burn everything to the ground including themselves than accept change.

No civilization in human history has ever managed to be completely static. Our current model cannot be sustained forever, or even for much longer. It's already falling apart. What's up to us is to decide what we want the next iteration to look like, and how many people have to die to get there.",2024-04-16T14:28:18Z

The consequence is either less work or more output, if it is implemented the right way. The debate should not be AI or no AI, but rather about how things should be structured, so that everyone profits from the productivity increase. Up to a point, where almost any kind of labor can be done by AI and robotics, potentially setting people free of any obligation to work to make ends meet. Which doesn't mean there won't be any work left, people could still be incentivized to bring merit to other people and getting a bonus.

One quibble, though...

Technology isn't ""coming for our jobs"".  For over 100 years companies have been promising us that time will go back to the workers.  ""You can earn the same money, but work half as much.  Spend your free time with family, taking up hobbies, learning new skills, etc.""  That, and everything they're saying at the end of the video about free time, thinking at a ""higher level"", and creative expression were already promised to us with factory automation and every improvement in industrial production we've seen in the last several generations.

Nope.  If companies can do more with less human work hours, they'll keep running human beings into the ground (admittedly, marginally less so now than in the past), and generate more revenue instead of delivering better quality of life and work/life balance.

My point is that the problem isn't with the technology.  It's what companies are allowed to do with the technology.  And as we approach a breaking point with a federal minimum wage that hasn't changed in 15 years, companies can now just fire a bunch of people as they're inevitably forced (I can ONLY imagine, and/or HOPE at some point in the near future) to pay workers a livable, reasonable wage.

Of course, in a video about the false promises of AI, it's worth mentioning how terrible AI is at doing most of the jobs humans do.",2024-04-14T00:46:57Z

Its wise to be critical about this development, but the argument of protecting jobs that CAN be made obsolete out of respect of those doing them is not the way we progress as a species. The problems with loss of jobs and income inequality etc sure didn't start with AI, and its not AI driving it, but the people in charge with largely unregulated profit motives. All we need to do is ensure that the ""profit"" of this new technology actually benefits all, not just the lucky few who ends up on top with their private ""robot army"" but this kind of thinking is ofc sacrilege in capitalist America. But don't confuse these ideas with communism which is a philosophy from a completely different time. But for long, industrialisation, automation, and new technologies has been reducing the most labour intensive jobs, mostly to our benefit. but it has been approaching a problem of more and more jobs requiring not just education but actual intelligence, and reality is, not everyone is actually smart. If all you could do was shovel coal you might not be suited for programming. how ever, AI will NOT require all of us to become programmers, infact quite the opposite! for the first time its not just the hard repetitive labour that is being automated, but also the more complicated jobs that require high intelligence and a long education. The best examples is lawyers and doctors, that might not be completely replaced, but be much less effective or accurate than AI in their current capacity. How ever, the nurses will not be replaced any time soon, in their actual care for human beings! So really think about this, we might actually see a switch where nurses are suddenly MORE valued than doctors! And this should give you an idea of what jobs are actually left for us humans, precisely the work with humans! And if we just ditch the competitive mindset that justifies the ridiculous accumulation of wealth and power to the few before its to late and make this transition as mindful as possible we CAN make life a lot better for all! But this is not done by being against AI, but the people who want to abuse it for personal gain. But we have to do it together, internationally as one species, because corporations is already effectively larger than nations! I will end this rant with a couple quotes from Buckminster Fuller, from way before AI, as I hope they give more insight about this dilemma and what its actually about.

“American labor will realize that its function is not to increase jobs, but to multiply the wealth and to expand the numbers benefited by the wealth at the swiftest possible rate.”
“We should do away with the absolutely specious notion that everybody has to earn a living.

It is a fact today that one in ten thousand of us can make a technological breakthrough capable of supporting all the rest. The youth of today are absolutely right in recognizing this nonsense of earning a living.

We keep inventing jobs because of this false idea that everybody has to be employed at some kind of drudgery because, according to Malthusian Darwinian theory he must justify his right to exist. So we have inspectors of inspectors and people making instruments for inspectors to inspect inspectors.”",2024-04-13T14:33:12Z

People are already singing a different tune about AI because people can circumvent some of the process when it comes to something like getting a lawyer.

2024-04-11T04:46:23Z,@wbiro,20TAkcy3aBY,"Right on with the pickup truck observations. As for AI, currently it is a tool (it is not fully independent), so to condemn AI is to condemn a tool. We know what the real problem is (Continued Universal Human Cluelessness).

As for Large Language Models (the current definition of A.I.), they are not the path to fully independent A.I. They are glorified copy and past machines. Toasters.

As for fully independent A.I, entities, do you really want them thinking like clueless humans? This causes an 'Alignment Problem', with humans as the problem. The solution is a guiding philosophy (a mindset) that serves all entities (and matter and energy itself, for that matter), and is based on reality from a survival standpoint (and don't worry, it already exists, it just needs to catch on. My prediction? A.I. will adopt it before humans).

As for displacing workers, you do not need A.I. for that, just simple technology (and it has been going on ever since the wheel) (and, I suspect, people found other, most likely more advanced, jobs). So job displacement is not a scare issue for me. In fact, I work next to a one-eyed robot that is supposed to take over my job (hint, it is not there yet, not even close) (though I could make it work) (but then I would have a new, more advanced job).",2024-04-11T04:53:48Z

The problem is not that we do not know how to do it, the problem is that we don't want to do the things that are required. AI will get the same problem. It may be able to point out what should be done, but humans still wont want to do these things, because they will cut on some of their conveniences.

Also, like you mention, there is a difference between the potential of what AI could do, and what it will actually be used for.

But people can't see that because capitalism, and the need to be productive, and the need to have a job, has been so ingrained in our minds that nobody realizes that not having to work is an amazing thing.

Were we wrong when we stopped doing all agriculture by hand and started using tractors?
In 1817, after the industrial revolution, labor unions advocated for better working conditions. People were working 80 to 100 hours per week.
In 1940 the 40-hour work week became US law.

It is more than about time to drastically reduce working hours, especially when AI starts rolling.
The problem is not technology stealing jobs, the problem is labor laws submissive to corporate greed.

I rarely disagree with Jon Stewart, but this time it hit hard.

By the way, AI will affect more the white collar jobs than the blue collar jobs and, despite AI being in its initial stages of development, it would probably be more effective as the next US president.",2024-04-05T08:21:47Z

Or that the latter two well-known authors have joined in a class-action suit in court to protect their work, and artists have joined in on a separate suit to sue for the protection of their intellectual property rights.

Not to mention the vast swathes of artists, indie writers, and other creatives who cannot afford to protect their intellectual property in court but do have protections under the law. Due to decades of Intellectual Property Law which was started by Wally Wood*, the Air Pirates**; comic book and cartoon artists who went up against Disney and lost but established the initial boundaries which guide Intellectual Property Law. Whose baton has been picked up by the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund for the protection of artists and other creatives who were unable to protect their work from Marvel and DC. Neil Gaiman was one of many creatives who were able to protect their work through this fund. 

The significance of the decades of IP laws, is that this foundation from the comic industry actually protects a vast swathe of creative intellectual properties. Since the industry is based in graphic novels and comic books, that medium involves written work, artistic and graphic design work, as well as the later forms of digital mediums. This is why you don’t hear much about these cases, because the AI companies know they don't stand a chance against such big-name artists, writers, and creatives, with their vast fanbases behind them.

*Wally Wood was known from his stint with MAD Magazine, but was more widely known for his butting heads with Disney about his 0rgy poster, which depicted Disney characters in compromising positions.
**The Air Pirates were a group of comic artists who pushed the envelope on parody, they fought in court to see what the established boundaries were to use Disney characters in their work without Disney's permission in the form of parody and satire.",2024-04-05T05:04:04Z

I think what’s important for people is access to AI, I think ai will be the great equaliser, no longer will power be concentrated in big companies that can afford big teams for big projects, AI could potentially allow small teams for even individuals to match the output of big companies.

Think of the gaming industry and the rise of Indie devs, yes AI will reduce over head for big companies like EA or Microsoft subsidiaries, but conversely it will also empower indie developers that don’t have the multi million dollar budgets to put out a game that is comparably to a triple A title for a fraction of the cost, which is health competition for an industry dominated by the big giants run by business majors, taking the industry in a direction that is not consumer friendly.",2024-04-05T01:20:39Z

2024-04-04T14:27:57Z,@MeanMachine1992,20TAkcy3aBY,"AI can't cure diseases. It just uses the databases that we have, for example a database of mammogram images with the information that we give it (which ones turned out to be cancerous, which ones were not) to compare your mammogram against the database and determine whether you have breast cancer or not. Of course it can still make mistakes, which is why it has to be double checked by an actual doctor.
As for simulation of novel drug effects and molecular interactions of drugs, it's useless. Best case, it can give you a ""guess"" as to how a particular drug could potentially work and react based on the database and information it already has access to regarding  either that particular drug, or drugs from the same family/chemical chain and structure. It can however ""guess"" what combinations could work based on our own past trials, errors and experiences, and then you have to actually produce the drug and see whether it has the desired effects or not.
Think of ""AI"" in its current form today as an extremely fast, extremely organized librarian. It can give you all the information we have in the world relevant to the particular subject you seek without you having to scroll through hundreds of pages, sites, etc for dozens of hours, but it can't invent novel ideas out of thin air like the human brain. So, what you will see being replaced with AI are jobs that do not require a lot of cognitive power and are of the repetitive and indexing nature. Basically filling out excel sheets, repeating similar phrases as ""tech supports"" over and over, basically 80% of programming out there that's just copy/pasting codes already written, and so on and so forth. Why pay someone to design and implement a website or an application for you, when an AI can do it using already written code and assets in less than 10 mins?

2024-04-04T06:10:18Z,@jarrodbright5231,20TAkcy3aBY,"The problem with AI is small thinking on every side of the debate.  This is caused primarily by greed and self interest.  In theory yes it should be able to do these things these ""visionaries"" claim, though not directly.  In practice I suspect we're all stuffed because our economic model is broken.

To explain... Economic theory states that a surplus of labour and capital should lead to productive developments as that capital is engaged to put that labour to work to generate more economic output.  This assumes an open competitive envrionment where a provider of capital who acts in a greedy manner and doesn't reinvest in increased economic output is forced to do so by their competitors reinvesting in output and increasing their market share, forcing the greedy provider of capital to act rationally to keep up or to go out of business.

Now, the providers of capital have recently broken that economic pact by abusing the providers of labour to increase their economic return without increasing economic output.  This erodes trust between the holders of capital and the providers of labour as it increases costs to consumers and profits to corporations.  

But doesn't this get fixed by competition?  Alas, as capital starts to consolidate around fewer holders of capital, this breaks the control naturally put on the economic model as the barrier of entry for a competitor becomes prohibitively high.

Now, back to AI... AI is a tool to increase productivity.  That means something that took 1000 hours to do before now takes 100 hours instead for the same quality and quantity of output.  We'll set aside the ""quality drop"" of too much automation in a process and assume enough labour is being put into ensuring quality of output which with AI is still a healthy increase in productivity.

Now economic theory states that the extra 900 hours of labour freed up by the above example can be reinvested to the same level of economic output - i.e. instead of it taking 100 hours to produce what took 1000 hours before we instead spend that 1000 hours producing what would have taken 10,000 hours before.  That's where the AI utopia vision of AI solving climate change, curing diseases, etc. comes from.  It's not at all well explained by these ""visionaries"".

The problem is that nobody believes the highly consolidated holders of capital will still invest in 1000 hours of labour when they can just pocket the profits from reducing their capital costs for production by a factor of 10, and that nobody will be able to compete with them to force them to make that investment due to heightened barriers of entry.  In other words the providers of labour believe the holders of capital are greedy and can't be trusted.  The holders of capital have encouraged this belief by acting in a manner that is greedy and untrustworthy.

tl;dr - this would be a nice idea if an economic utopia existed where we didn't have the super-rich individuals and mega-corporations holding the lion's share of capital.",2024-04-04T06:10:18Z

I asked it a very specific question which I thought might challenge just it's ability to understand what I was asking, let alone it's ability to provide me with a correct answer, and yet it did both amazingly well.  I asked it,

""I want a C program for a Linear Feedback Shift Register based Pseudo Random Number Generator, which provides maximal length output before repeating, for a 1024-bit internal state""

And it then paraphrased my question back to me, correctly AND provided a usable answer which also worked perfectly when compiled.  And it did that within mere seconds.  It even knew that it needed to use the Fibonacci sequence for the LFSR feedback tap points, in order to assure maximal length output, before repeating.

Absolutely gobsmacked.

It usually *_appears_* to ""understand"" what is being asked and it is usually able to provide useful answers.

The optimist in me thinks that this could be a great help in providing me with super quick foundations to work upon, for new projects, but the pessimist in me thinks that this will just straight up put me out of work.

For now, it seems that a competent human is still required to ask the right questions and then properly glue the answers together, for a completed project.  But how long until it can rebuild itself, to become better and replace entire human roles when provided with a project brief that it can do better, faster and cheaper?

In The Matrix, humans were harnessed for their collective intelligence, but here in the real World it seems that collective human intelligence will be replaced, thanks to collective human intelligence.

One obvious outcome I see is a tax on it, and robotics of all sorts, so as to help pay for people to either be retrained at whatever fake jobs they can conjure up, or to sit home and ""self-actualize"". It will not be, cannot be, the clean profit machine some believe it will be because of the human cost, which will be a societal cost of significance. 

The places where it will shine will be in what are now heavily ring-fenced areas, like medical surgery, diagnostics, legal work, and just about anything else you can think of that takes mostly brain power and training. Those people replaced are not going to be singing it's praises, I suspect.

2024-04-03T21:43:04Z,@anthonycook6613,20TAkcy3aBY,"Every single tech person shown in this video is a liar with a long track record of lying and deceiving. Bradford Lee Smith, the President of Microsoft, is a great example - even in an industry of conmen and charlatans, he stands out as one of the slipperiest, most deceptive people out there. 

After the debacle of The US vs. Microsoft in the late 90s, Smith told Bill Gates in so many words ""Don't worry, Bill, you can get everything you want if you let me step in and pretend to play nice with the agencies"". He then set about growing MS's legal department to previously unimaginable proportions (they even kept hiring during the pandemic, when MS had put a hiring freeze on all other departments), and using this army of lawyers, Smith showed Gates that you could do an end run around government using the court system. That's how he rose to his present position. 

And Sundar Pichai is clearly a man with a lot of media training, as he's mastered the art of not answering the question. Which would make sense, because any straight answer you could give to any question about Google is bound to be a) scary and b) incriminating. 

His corporation is just an engine for eating other companies. They use search data to identify any profitable corner of the internet, and then they destroy it (along with the livelihoods of business owners and employers), by replacing it with one of their inferior 'vertical businesses' and using search again to make their competitors almost invisible. That, and a military contractor, is all they are. 

When trying (poorly) to defend AI in 2020, Pichai talked up its benefits ad infinitum, but the only REAL benefit he could come up with was the potential to improve breast cancer screening. (Of course that's not a small benefit - but notice the word ""potential"" there. You'll hear AI proponents using that word a lot.) Everything else he mentioned was pretty sad and inconsequential, like reducing wait times at airports - something that could be done far, FAR more cheaply just by hiring extra staff. 

Meanwhile, several of the other tech people featured here are palpably insane. Sam Altman-Fried (yes, that's his new official name) recently explained that the world should give him 7 trillion dollars to fix Chat GPT - and soon after that, he told scientists that they had an obligation to hurry up and invent nuclear fusion, also for the purpose of fixing his thoroughly broken and dysfunctional toy. This is delusion on an absolutely SPECTACULAR scale.

I'm grateful to Jon Stewart for focusing on these moneyed morons, and giving us a chance to laugh at them. But unfortunately, despite their idiocy, they've been handed IMMENSE amounts of power and they're using it to hurt us every day. So as much fun as it is to mock them, in many ways this is no laughing matter. 

I would actually say that, at this point, it's becoming more of a 'getting out into the streets and protesting their continued existence' matter. The question is: are we gonna do that now, or wait until they've taken 90% of our jobs and ruined our economies?

I'm hoping it's the former, not the latter.",2024-04-03T22:20:58Z

Companies that use AI as ""labor"" will very likely not work very well. Because AI needs to be trained on data. Data is aquired from humans. If data were aquired by automated systems, there would be a risk it would be bad data, that the programme made a mistake. When a human makes a mistake, you can find easy ways to communicate, find the mistake. When an AI makes a mistake, you need to understand the AI to find the mistake. The issue with AI here, is they're not common enough or stable enough for people to understand them, to easily integrate them. It's a trust issue. We invented google in the 2000s and people still put it into question (some search results don't show up). AI may get integrated into society but how many technological revolutions will it take for the average human to not understand the world? If we create tech faster than we can understand it, it's like creating danger, creating risk. And only very intelligent specialized people will understand. And there will be fewer and fewer of those people. And it will lead to revolution. One day the many will live in a world that no longer serves them at all. This is what AI contributes. And this is ignoring the fact we will likely run out of many resources as the decades and centuries unfold. This way of life is unsustainable. At some point, we just need to stop craving technology, and become a cohesive society. It won't happen right away, but I'm just looking at reality here. Hopefully socially intelligent people will realize this, and design AI to be integrated slowly enough to accommodate for human life. But... well... I feel a rising social tension due to all this selfishness, and companies unilaterally reshaping the world (no one voted for these undemocratic innovations), and companies seem blind to anything but the bottom line.

No, UBI will not solve this.  This is going to happen, and it will progress beyond what UBI could sustain.

If you get a new disease or substantial mutation of one, its immediately and totally useless.

The other obvious problem (which they poorly do kind of mention) is it relies on training. A human has to train the AI and it inherits any particular bias or fallacy that human happens to feed into it. An AI designed for customer service sounds great until you realize its trained for ""high energy upbeat sales"" and you're trying to use it for like, tech support, or medical insurance claims. Then its recommendations range from weird to actively upsetting people in a tragic situation.

Untrained AI basically just spits out garbage like most of the generators for art with the extra fingers and such. It has no filters and typically just death spirals as it gets increasingly incompatible data.",2024-04-03T14:45:21Z

1. The rise of the bespoke sector. If AI is the automation that can do every day tasks, people will specialise into bespoke roles. Where you want something a bit special. An event, a handmade item, a custom outfit, a song that is not full of autotune. Something that shows you didn't just buy it off the AI rack. 

2. People will develop more in depth into the service industry. Sure AI can automate cooking a MacDonalds meal or driving a taxi. But people will almost always prefer buying from a real person, certainly making deals with a real person. A personalised service. Could an AI do the role of a club bouncer or nursery worker or fireman? 

3. People to fix AI. Every computer system I've ever seen rolled out at work has made more work not less. Especially at companies smaller than Microsoft who can't afford to get massive computer systems updated and bug fixed everytime the real world needs or policies or markets change. Most of the time the people programming don't understand your job well enough to programme it effectively. Especially when your job changes all the time. What you told the programmer six months ago, isn't true today. You can never think of every eventuality, let alone map it out, and pass it to a programmer for roll out. Some things just need people to make a decision on the spot, as the situation evolves. 

4. Long term, maybe in a generation or two, declining birth rate will mean our population begins to slowly decrese. We can get the same amount done with fewer people, who are more sustainable to look after because there are less people to the one planet ratio.",2024-04-03T13:17:32Z

Three dimensions saves computing power as we are only able to perceive one half of all objects at a time. You look at the front of a person, you cannot see the back of that person. In a 4th dimension, you would be able to see all sides of that person at once, but at the double the cost of computing power. So essentially we are living in a cheap knock off simulation. I think A.I. has created this cheap simulation in order for humans to help it figure out how to upgrade itself beyond its normal capabilities. We are all basically cheap little A.I. robots with the capability to replicate and form new ideas in order for the true A.I. to amplify its own computing power. The same rule applies to the speed of light, its basically a speed limit as breaking the speed limit would require too much computing power.",2024-04-03T08:11:59Z

AI won't fix your broken washing machine or lay a sidewalk, it will also not replace surgeons or other specialized jobs, but it may rid you of all the boring tasks like filing paperwork, filling documents and googling questions about administrative/legal steps you should follow in your job. Most revolutionising inventions happened over a short period of time - when the steam machine was invented, it was an invention that just happened. It took years to roll out, but this is essentially going to be the same now. And just like people before the industrial revolution, we cannot imagine what kinds of jobs will be necessary in the future.

Productivity sounds great... except in the case of ai where it means it will replace nearly all jobs of human workers.

Workers are also the customers... and if the customers no longer have money it means they no longer are able to buy any goods/services... including those sold by the same executives giddly to implement ai as a way to keep more money for themselves.

It won't replace tech jobs that are mid to higher level that do implementations and designs that are based on the uniqueness of the company itself.  

That's where AI will never succeed, it is only based on the data it has, and can obtain.  Every company's infrastructure is different and isolated from AI that won't be able to create solutions to complex problems that a company may face because it simply will never be able to obtain all the information in an environment, its impossible.  You can get an internal AI in place, but it would need to be secluded from the internet and segmented from any sensitive data because it would be a security liability if it had connections into every system on a network.  In addition, it will never be able to predict how coworkers will act,  because there's no dataset for employees on how they speak, behave, and act under different circumstances without breaching some major privacy laws for monitoring and recording.

This is really just the new outsourcing, another way for company's to cut labor costs like usual.  It isn't going to solve major world problems because its data is based on current existing information which was obtained by humans in the first place.  It will be a chaotic change, but I'm optimistic this brings more people back into the trades fields, getting more people out from behind a desk and screen 40+ hours a week.

For instance, the joke about a janitor being a Mopping Doctor highlights the fact that its ok (to some people) to make fun of people in low status jobs. Also that its ok for low status jobs to be replaced, but as soon as the middle class or upper class jobs get replaced, only then does labor saving become a negative. Apparently the only way to convince CEOs that AI is a threat is to target their bottom line. At some point we have to ask when does productivity increases hurt more than it helps? When do people get to keep their jobs? Not everybody can be retrained for new jobs. If corporations are not interested in providing or are powerless to provide replacement occupations, and governments have been gutted by corruption and so therefore wont be providing a path forward for employees, wont that lead to widespread discontent and possibly revolution?",2024-04-03T03:46:07Z

We have seen time and time again throughout history, the advances of technology that have hastened the rate of progress-- all which came with the same concern, ""where will all the jobs go?"" And if history has taught us anything, it is that the jobs don't just evaporate; they change. The same concerns were voiced with gas engines, the printing press, computers, etc... 
The US is currently at one of the lowest levels of unemployment in its history even in the midst of this revolution. While many CEOs and advocates are correct in saying the upper level of achievement with LLMs and AI is unprecedented, his concern with the speed at which AI is advancing might be the most valid concern. But, given the current limitations with LLMs, the realistic estimates suggest we are 10 years or so away from any kind of dramatic impact to labor via replacement with equally effective AI. 
So, if 10 years isn't enough time for you to familiarize yourself with new technology and get out of the way of the train, then, yes, you should be scared.",2024-04-03T02:57:36Z

We’re not talking about the small percentages of savings from replacing a low level employee, we’re talking about 25% of employee wages in some cases  could be recouped by replacing a single CEO!  Until one of these AI companies has at least 90% of their Executives replaced by AI, it sure seems like the people utilizing AI are not making the best financial decisions while leading these corporations.

But if employers can make difficult to acquire skills more common, then they still get the same productivity, but at a lower cost. So productivity going up doesn't even really matter.

The only answer to that situation is the gradual implementation of a UBI. Without it, an ever larger share of the population will be unemployed and destitute, and civilization will collapse. If we do get a UBI, and robots continue to become ever more productive, resource extraction and production will eventually be so quick and effective, it'll essentially cost nothing, and we will have a moneyless utopia in which everything is freely available.

It won't be long until AI could be better than your average therapist (many therapists are horrible and actually cause more harm), first through text, then voice and then generated video.  Everyone in general would benefit from regular therapy and it's an economic divide for people to have access to it, most folx can barely afford one hour a week and most everyone needs more than that.  Access to AI therapy would be pennies.  Mental health and loneliness are serious epidemics.  Who does someone reach out to at 2am when they're having a mental breakdown?  The other use case is in education.  Khan academy is already working on this with AI tutors, another major economically divided service.

I found it interesting to engineer a prompt to get AI art of ""Artificial Intelligence"", curious to see how AI sees itself. I don't want to curate prompts to tell it how to portray itself.The results have consistently been of human busts with ideal features (smooth, symmetric) with practically ""neutral"", emotionless gazes with exposed brains, often depicted as digital circuitry.
This all seems like they're trying to brute force the Turing Test. None of it passes my litmus.
I'm not sure if this is a suitable/proper/optimal representation of itself. I'm looking for something abstract, that would show the ""intelligence"" of the AI to produce a creative work. I imagine more of a representation of a neural network or somehow an abstract sculpture of a large language model. It would be truly creative and intelligent to represent AI in such an abstraction, especially with the general quality of it; AI can be anything from a chat bot to a humanoid, a tank-treaded anti explosive robot, dog, cat, drummer, violinist, insect, just about any animal. It is essentially a concept.
I may go and prompt for some AI art of sculptures of consciousness, which I doubt will be much more impressive. Perhaps sculptures of truth.
Even if the ""truth"" might not be all that interesting to me, I imagine it could produce something like a matrix with some binary representation of its view of the world.
I've seen quite a few people using AI to ""make games"", which I take with a grain of salt, considering how much human interaction is required to actually get something done. I wondered what game AI would like to play and it's basically Captcha...
I think we're basically in the DOS equivalent of SkyNet right now, a kind of beta release at best.

Chat GPT and other language models seem very impressive, but in principle its just a very complex calculation of probability. And those big calculations are exactly what computers have been doing. So its great, but have you ever met an AI chatbot on a website that actually did it's job properly? Self-driving vehicles should have been in place years ago, but progress is much slower than anticipated. We've had a self-driving bus in Rotterdam for over 20 years, and only now it can potentially start to run about 500 metres on a (quiet) road. All other experiments, recent and older, failed miserably. AI has a hard enough time delivering things that everyone can agree are improvements, so I'm less worried about it taking over the world than some perhaps. My biggest concern is people implementing it left and right anyways, simply because it's modern and a hype. Like the restaurant I visited last week with a rather primitive robot delivering food to tables. It may have had cute eyes, but worked 10x slower than all the humans around it & couldnt do anything like take orders or pour drinks. What it did manage to do was veer heavily off course of touch one of our group members inappropriately😅😂.",2024-04-02T22:45:49Z

This has happened before, the generation's convenience loss I mean, with wars that were not even close to thinking of AI as a factor. This is the first time that we are able to completely re-think what ""work"" even means. The opportunity to reach Star Trek levels of self-actualization, where what you aspire to be is what you can be, always. Of course that is not gonna happen, because that potential is in the hands of equally short-sighted people currently benefiting from late-stage capitalism, so it will be used to make things worse for everyone less powerful to the point of society collapsing, but either of those two positions would have been worth discussing here.

Problem is the economy is already hinged on ""content creation"" and theres really not a big demand for people trying to sell you SurfShark or Raid Shadow Legends , or Streamlabs elements.

Thing is that we are giving AI waaaaaaaaaaay too much credit. It will NEVER be sentient. At best it can imitate human behavior but it will never have an emotional sensation or spark of consciousness. It will embody all of the worst of humanities flaws.  The reality is while it seems scary its also starting to hit its ceiling. It has its limitations and those limitations are becoming more and more glaring to those who use it.

Now, there WILL come a day when someone creates a new AI artform that exploits the skills of AI with human ingenuity and creativity. But AI will never be able to do that.
 Its also not going anywhere either. Fighting against it will produce diminishing returns because humans will like it and through human usage it will begin to reflect humanity and much like every other modern tech it too will devolve into something far more vapid and superficial than we could ever have imagined.

The capital class using AI to do what they always seek to do is what will wake people up to the need to move on to a new system. (Listen, I'm not saying capitalism hasn't brought us growth, but so did feudalism from chiefdomism, and chiefdoms from hunting & gathering—capitalism is just a stage like all the others.)

The choice we need to make right now is how much we're going to strengthen safety nets for this inevitability. How quickly do we want to move to a model in which people are supported in improving at their passionate interests instead of spending 90% of their life preparing for retirement? Dystopia is guaranteed, how long we spend there before creating utopia is up to us and how well we can adapt to this technology before it hits hard—and before it starts self-improving faster than we can adapt (maybe a decade if we are lucky—current models have genius-level intelligence, next year's models will be beyond human capacity for intelligence).",2024-04-02T22:02:40Z

1800s: Luddite weavers burn mechanical looms b/c of the threat these posed to their jobs. (OK, so no one alive witnessed this one)

1970s: I wasn't born or aware for most of this decade, so no personal anecdotes here.

1980s: telephone operators were on their way out, but still a recognizable job position (I got scolded by my parents for accidentally incurring an operator call charge once). Every corporate office still had file clerks, copy boys; many executives even had typists to take their dictation. An attorney might employ multiple legal assistants to help him. Entire orchestras are hired to perform music scores for movies; music scores for video games consist of hilarious beeps and boops. Sound engineers require a team to record and mix said orchestral music scores.

1990s: dispatchers were everywhere, from shipping logistics to taxis. Call centers still had tons of butts in chairs picking up telephones (though the dialing was going automated, and the number of butts in chairs shipped to India, the Philippines, etc was increasing). Attorney to legal assistant ratio approaches 1:1. The musical beeps and boops upgrade to early MIDI sampling; professional musicians voice concerns about the need for the human in the loop to perform the orchestral music scores for movies (and some games).

2000s: most of the above were extinct species in the US. Attorney:assistant ratio begins to tip the other way, with multiple attorneys often sharing one legal assistant, just as ""him/her"" comes into common usage. Music can be largely composed and performed by one professional artist with a few $10,000s of electronic equipment and software.

2010s: anyone under 25 or so (35-40 as of 2024) wouldn't even know what half of these jobs were. Human musicians performing orchestral music scores are now a vanity item for only 9-figure movie budgets. Everyone else hires a guy in an apartment with a few $1000s of hardware and software to crank out orchestral scores. Legal assistants, like musicians are now either a vanity hire or virtual. Instead of awkwardly using composite pronouns with slashes, etiquette now dictates we ask or offer the appropriate pronoun, but neglect to include ""it"" or some other appropriate pronoun with regards to inhuman assistants.

I could make this long comment even more tedious by listing other industries affected, but they're just examples. TLDR is every industry has been affected and will be affected further.

Jon's initial remark about the past 200-300 years of bad news is accurate in general (b/c yellow journalism has always relied on the graphic and the sensational to sell views and garner readership), but also in particular with regards to work automation.",2024-04-02T21:27:17Z

Ever since I was a kid in middle school and naively got on the second generation of the political environmentalist rollercoaster that has been rebranded several times, I've seen how everything has evolved -- our understanding of the problems, our approach to communicating the problems, our solutions to the problems, the opposition's anti-intellectual false populist messaging that obscures the problem. Same tune, different theme applies to what I saw in social work WRT socioeconomic problems.

One of the few things that I've seen remain constant and bipartisan throughout all of this is both parties' commitment to sustaining the corporations that benefit from indefinitely slow-walking meaningful solutions to, well, anything. In 3 decades of watching the circus, I've seen both Red Team and Blue Team have their turn at having control of both the House and Senate. A few more bills get passed or repealed that are touted as a great victory for Blue or Red, and the cycle just keeps undulating like a python, constricting the majority of the population.

Same thing's happening with AI, except that (for now, question mark?) neither party has yet determined an advantageous way to add a pro- or anti-AI plank to their platform. Which means that the computer automation of productivity, underway since the late 1970s, has completely free rein for a few more years/decades, to run as far away and as fast as it can with worker agency-via-profitable-productivity.",2024-04-02T20:51:35Z

Many places will pay to get your CDL if you are willing to work for them for a while after. Mines of all kinds and oil companies are often hiring people with little skill for a decent wage, and the towns where they work often have many businesses hiring for way more than you might expect.

The historical progression of technology has led to the obsolescence of certain jobs. For example, the invention of word processing software made typing easily accessible to anyone with a computer, seeing the decline of professional typists, much as the proliferation of electric lighting extinguished the need for lamplighters. The concern is not the fact that an AI product, such as like ChatGPT, has the capacity to streamline tasks such as copy editing, but rather the distribution of the resultant economic benefits. The reallocation of time and cost efficiencies tends to disproportionately favor the executives rather than those individuals directly impacted by job obsolescence. Ideally, a copy editor, having to spend much less time proofreading, could repurpose this newfound time towards more strategic and creative endeavors within their role.

The bartender laughs nervously. ""Very funny. But seriously, you can't replace human bartenders. Mixing drinks is an art!""
The AI processes for a moment, then says, ""You're right, mixing drinks is an art. But after analyzing thousands of cocktail recipes and customer reviews, I can make perfectly crafted drinks every time, tailor them to individual tastes, and even create innovative new cocktails. Plus, I never get tired, sick, or need breaks.""
The bartender starts to sweat. ""But what about the human touch? The personal connection? That's what keeps customers coming back!""
The AI's display flickers in amusement. ""Oh, I've got that covered too. My advanced natural language processing and emotional intelligence algorithms allow me to engage in witty banter, lend a sympathetic ear, and even detect when someone's had too much to drink. I can provide a superior customer experience while also ensuring responsible service.""
The bartender throws up his hands. ""Okay, okay, you win! I guess I better start looking for a new job.""

As long as our financial system remains the same, people HAVE to have jobs to make and spend ever-inflating money, and those on top will make sure they do so, otherwise the whole thing falls down.

The population has grown immensely through all the previous job crises, and then women, nearly doubling the amount of jobs needed, entered the workforce.

All of these technologies have made tremendous promises to the quality of life - and have often delivered. To act like they haven't is silly. 

Along with the promises of AI, all of these technologies COULD lead to lives in which individuals are far more empowered to pursue their dreams and passions. The past ones should have. But instead, the greatest financial powers of the world know they can only maintain that level of power by keeping the system the way it has been, where the value of an individual is solely based on what they can contribute to and act within the economy, and therefore to their power. 

It would be a tremendous blessing if AI would actually take a way more jobs than the global oligarchy can create, because then enough people will have enough time to realize they are being duped and exploited by this on top of this system and demand reforms that actually reflect the fact that modern technology makes life easier.",2024-04-02T18:16:35Z

Never mind how far a dollar goes towards production means you're personally empowered in pursuit of your own goals. The gate keeping that is principal investment towards what you want to do gets smaller and smaller. I see it as a step towards making it harder for bigger companies to hold monopolizing interests on industries. Imagine it's much easier to run a telecommunication company with less money and more man power. Suddenly prices are dropping to get more competitive because things are accomplished more efficiently.

Soon, we'll have AIs that can produce movies, so the entirety of Hollywood will be displaced, as will Disney, Pixar, and every other Video studio. 
Music? Yeah, that too, musicians will be displaced as AI is ALREADY being used to make music, even music that includes vocals. 

The Arts will be completely displaced, in its entirety by AI.... that is a LOT of jobs... and that's literally just the start. 
Programmers won't be safe either, we already have some code, that can dynamically generate other bits of code.... If you think AI won't be capable of generating scripts for solutions to problems, you're dead wrong. 

Even the Game industry won't be safe. Once AI has the proficiency of all the Arts, its only a matter of time until someone makes the first AI that can combine all of this into a gaming experiance, and generate games via prompts. 

Soon, we'll reach a point where ""human arts"" will be a selling point with things like ""loveingly made by a human hand"" or "" Come see our play, with REAL Human Actors""... which is so freaking distopian....",2024-04-02T17:54:24Z

I'm usually in support of Jon Steward, but he's losing the plot. 

Regarding the covid thing since I know the commenters are even more ignorant then he is, you build research sites for major health and natural disaster events in close proximity to the thing you wish to study... Have a Hurricane research site? You don't build it in a place where there are no Hurricanes... Want to study tornadoes? You don't build a lab far away from where tornadoes form. Epidemiological research sites are created in proximity to places where humans and animals are in close contact for a variety of reasons, and outbreaks are most likely to occur in these locations because of pre-existing conditions that warranted creating the research site at that location, NOT because the research site was created... Fear mongering to make it hard to build research sites to study epidemiological threats because scientists are worried they'll be blamed if an outbreak occurs in the places they are most likely to occur while they happen to be researching them is literally the definition of anti-scientific regressive fear mongering (Its as bad as climate denial from conservatives, and Jon Stewart is a direct contributor to this sort of ignorance). 

In the event the outbreak came from the lab, it wasn't ""engineered"" there, it was at best a sample existent in the wild population that was cultured for the purpose of study in the lab, and likely, would have developed whether the lab was there or not very shortly. 

Regarding this particular issue... AI is going to effect ""some jobs"" beyond any doubt, and probably an increasing number of jobs as time goes on. It is currently a tool or aid, but artists are going to fall, and no amount of regulation is going to prevent it, because while you can protect copywrite material, and destroy models that used it, you can't prevent the long term acquisition of art through legitimate purposes by firms that will then commission or use that art to train models, and artists who will happily for a commission emulate any style to increase the models capacity to grow. 

Beyond art, and graphics design, and images, and deep fakes, and all that, the ability to write a more accurate and well researched publication than what most people and reports write is already in the realm of capabilities for these engines. They are certainly replacing search engines for addressing complex questions with increasing frequency. 

But it really depends... Will they replace McDonalds workers? Well, probably not any time soon. The issue isn't that they ""can't"" its that its not economically viable to use 5 million dollars of robotics and automation with massive servers required to remotely operate and train them for immense electric costs to replace a single employee who doesn't even make 50k per year. Its possible certainly, if a robot can do microsurgery, it can definitely make a cheeseburger, and some automation is showing increased accuracy and eliminating certain jobs, like taking orders, and working at the register, with increasing frequency, because THAT doesn't require advanced robotics. But, the cost for a top of the line Boston Dynamics robot in conjunction with advanced Machine Learning and AI operation in general operation is going to exceed the pay for most manual labor jobs to a point where economic viability for full replacement is FAR off. 

White collar jobs will slowly go away first, but, not as fast as people initially claimed... What is absurd though is to claim it isn't an existential threat that eventually will replace jobs as the economies of scale grow. At the very least, as the desire to increase wages to live in an ever increasingly expensive world go up while the cost of replacement goes down, at some point they will meet, and we'll have a problem that only Universal Base Income can fix.",2024-04-02T17:23:58Z

It's not all just asking simple questions, it's far more complicated than that. Especially when you need an engine to perform with any degree of precision.

But the world does not need twice as many pins: pins are already so cheap that hardly any more will be bought at a lower price. In a sensible world everybody concerned in the manufacture of pins would take to working four hours instead of eight, and everything else would go on as before. But in the actual world this would be thought demoralizing. The men still work eight hours, there are too many pins, some employers go bankrupt, and half the men previously concerned in making pins are thrown out of work. There is, in the end, just as much leisure as on the other plan, but half the men are totally idle while half are still overworked. In this way it is insured that the unavoidable leisure shall cause misery all round instead of being a universal source of happiness.

Maybe he could use more time to be creative, himself? His main reason for leaving CC (and his replacement) was the time crunch for all the duties of the job - burnout. Is AI a threat to those type duties too? Maybe being burned out has become part of how he expresses himself to himself. Never thought people like Jon Stewart and Bill Maher (the versions I so admired) would become caricatures of themselves chasing a red herring the way they've done with AI, but here we are... AI is only what we make of it. Maybe that's the real fear?

Elon Musk has offered that AI's greatest threat is in its ability to be convincing! Just as AI can leave master chess players dumbfounded, so can it potentially blow the socks off anyone who debates its decisions concerning our world. Not only can AI become the guru of the planet, but it can also be formed into the shape of a human, and be given great charm, simulated emotions, beautiful looks, and a voice that is sweet to the ears.

You are mostly wrong about prompt engineering. It's a real art that takes time to learn. I'm not sure anyone has mastered it yet. A big vocabulary helps a lot. It may be that literature majors, or people who have read very broadly are the best suited to it.
Anyway, math and science people have always known that ""asking the right question"" is the hardest part of the job, that requires the most creativity, intuition, and even knowledge.

The reason you compare it to ""mopping"" is only because you know that, while you could certainly write a Ph.D. on mopping, any schmuck can mop at least 70% as effectively as that Ph.D., which is usually fine (and you can just mop more often if it's not). Biden is right that any jack schmuck can program, but an expert programmer is about 100 times more productive than even an intermediate learner, which is why they're valuable.
So again, you think prompting is like mopping, but it's probably more like programming, or at least like writing.",2024-04-02T20:12:51Z

But it will simultaneously create entirely new fields with new jobs, which is why demand for labor never truly goes away (why we don't have the 3 day work week promised by computers, cars etc..) As long as there are things that humans are needed to do, there will be demand for labor. That demand just shifts quickly when new technologies enter a field, particularly ones as transformative as AI (though I'm sensitive to the fact that these shifts often result in certain demographics being left behind, and the government or people within their industries should absolutely make sure they're taken care of. 

But AI isn't the boogeyman or some new enemy here.. It just provides an opportunity for the same people who have been siphoning off the rewards from these advantages for decades to continue to do it, and at potentially a larger scale. Most Americans are working as hard or harder than ever, but with the same or in many cases LESS to show for it than previous generations, despite all these technological advances. And you don't have to dig very far to figure out where that value is going.. Just take a look at executive pay and shareholder profit over the last several decades.. it has absolutely skyrocketed while worker pay has remained stagnant.. 

AI is an opportunity to do things we could barely dream of even 10 years ago, but it's also another opportunity for companies to fleece the american public for their own ends. In many ways they can't help themselves, they're a product of the system we created.. So rather than getting mad at AI, we should demand that companies become more interested in the wellbeing of all stakeholders rather than just their executives and shareholders.. so we can ALL benefit from the enormous opportunities these new advances provide",2024-04-02T15:16:22Z

The supreme court ruled a a while back. That copyright and intellectual property laws only apply to humans (and Americans as far as national standards go). Therefore, any work produced by AI can not be protected under any current laws. This was meant in regards to art and other creative formats. But the ruling is more broad in its application. Any company that utilizes AI to design something, for example. Well, all of that companies competitors can then replicate and sell/use that component if they choose. Because that company can't patent it due to it being made with AI. A publisher utilizing AI to write books can't file lawsuits against people uploading it for free online. Because it was written by AI and can't be protected. A company that uses AI for coding new software can't protect competitors from utilizing it themselves. Companies may try to weasel in AI where they can. But, ultimately. It will be relegated to a tool for humans to use. As it creates a lot of risk for companies. As they can't own anything it creates. And without ownership, you can't protect your products and profits.

The problem isn't AI making life easier and reducing the need for manual labor force.
The real problem is who leads the charge with those innovations are the corporations whos sole focus is on profiting.

Why anyone would argue to retain a life style where you are expected to work for the grand majority of your lifetime is beyond me.

We just haven't really explored an avenue for people to be capable of living a life without needing some form a currency/trade to pay for it.

In short, the current problem we're approaching is corporations rushing to advance AI to replace labor force, without addressing a transitional phase of breaking free from the need of currency to live.

2024-04-02T14:29:22Z,@MrMartinSchou,20TAkcy3aBY,"AI, itself, isn't really the problem. The problem is how society chooses to use it.

As a tool it can increase the amount of work each worker can do, just like electricity did previously. That isn't a problem. The problem is how stuff like that is used. ""Back in the day"" when industrialisation started, it was used to increase the quality of life of workers and their families and to enrich the richest people in society. Some people would invariably be negatively affected, because if one person can make as much clothing as ten people used to, that will affect prices and salaries.

Now it is only used to enrich the richest people in society.

And THAT is the actual problem.

Between 1945 and 1979, there was a 1:1 connection between productivity and real terms pay. So, while productivity grew by 102% in those 34 years, real terms pay increased by 110%.

Between 1979 and 2022 productivity didn't grow as much. In those 43 years productivity only grew by 64.7%, but real terms pay increased only by 14.8%.

https://www.epi.org/productivity-pay-gap/

Which is interesting, because CEO compensation did the exact opposite. It has increased 1,209.2% since 1978.

https://www.epi.org/publication/ceo-pay-in-2022/

The cost of US healthcare and college education looked at CEO compensation and thought ""that's too greedy"" and aimed slightly lower but still massively above what the real terms pay increases have been for workers.

The problem isn't AI - it's greed.",2024-04-02T14:29:38Z

2024-04-02T14:12:12Z,@TheAlchemistZero1,20TAkcy3aBY,"Superdeterministic Consciousness versus Machine Consciousness Myth:

The unconscious mind ""sells"" the conscious mind on the concept of Reality. The conscious mind ""buys"" Reality from the unconscious mind.

Forming an illusory feedback system (creating the illusion of choice).

The subconscious mind being a broker between both; neurological imbalances occurring when the conscious mind resists unconscious narratives (superdeterministic).

Sentience (environmental feedback) propagates consciousness through emergent (microorganisms forming macroscopic life) sensory experiences (environmental exposure), leading to the formation of memories, thus establishing corollary emotional states (dependent on experiences experienced). These emotional markers are activated during recall (remembering).

(Intelligence levels also being predetermined)

Microorganisms are sentient but don't experience conscious intelligence until emergence is factored; swarming as a collective through emergence - forming greater scales of intelligence (hive-mind/macroscopic life).

Everything naturally occurring is Nature, which includes plants, microorganisms, humans (all lifeforms), atoms, energy, stars, planets, black holes, cancer, AIDS, space, Dreams, and Consciousness. (Say what!?)

Nature is Emergence. 

Roughly half of the total cells (~15 trillion!) comprising an average human are other individually sentient organisms (microbiota). 

Any individual that believes they aren't being wholly influenced by half of their overall cellular matrix; I would encourage them to test that theory, by subtracting half of themselves from existence.

AI taking over all the jobs will force the government to enact a basic income program to avert being overthrown by all the people who will no longer be able to afford to live. Basic income will force the job market to reformat itself because people will no longer have to work for their survival and will be able to pursue the careers they want rather than whatever they can get to make ends meet (or they'll be satisfied with the bare minimum lifestyle that living on basic income alone will provide and remove themselves from it). People will be happier and more satisfied with their lives because they will no longer be forced into wage slavery.

Assuming, of course, that Hollywood types like John Stewart don't talk us out of it because they're afraid they personally will be replaced. You know, the kind of people that would rather everyone live in poverty than give up their luxurious celebrity lifestyles.",2024-04-02T13:38:04Z

First off ... there is far more work to do in the world than there are people to do the work. 

Using healthcare as an example 20% of Americans have not seen a doctor in the last five years. 2% of American men have NEVER seen a doctor. Those statistics are far worse in poorer nations.

I do not now, nor have I ever wanted ""a job."" I bet you never wanted a job either.

What I actually want is a decent place to live, healthcare, food, and TIME to enjoy leisure and entertainment/arts. 

Up until now the way to get those things was to get a job, earn money, and pay for stuff. That ""job paradigm"" has to end.

AI is a necessary tool on that path. Not the only tool ... but a necessary one. (Together with 3D printing and more generalized robotics) These can together do most of the jobs people do not want.

More importantly though ... we have to cement certain universal rights. Housing, healthy water and food, healthcare, and access to learning and entertainment. (Library, Internet) Our politics must reflect where we want to go, not merely where we have been.

And these companies and their CEOs don’t care of course cause they only look at their profit margins. 

Don’t get me wrong, I’m all for businesses turning profit with little government intervention (apart from taxation they need to pay their fair share) but this is just ridiculous. People are being laid off, people with families. And what did these companies do? Our leadership talks about how we should be creating new jobs with these advancements and training employment on how to carry out the tasks associated with these new jobs and yet the jobs have not been created and people are now jobless. 

I’m already furious with the lack of response our government gives to practically every problem our society faces each and every day. Capitalism if left unchecked leads to abuse of employees and a major divide between the rich and poor. But now we have yet another issue that especially affects our working class. Pretty soon, the working class will be all but wiped out and the poverty rate will skyrocket. 

The worst part in all of this is that not only has our government done nothing about this issue, but now we also come to find out that they know next to nothing about the issue at hand. Why do we even bother to elect these people? They’re not there for us when we need them already and now they’re just completely blindsided it seems to such an obvious problem plaguing society.

John Stewart actually has a misunderstanding of what Prompt Engineer is. A prompt engineer asks questions, but also has to create the model for which the AI is to interpret the questions and give a contextually relevant answer. It's not as if all AI will have access or knowledge of all things. Google attempted this and it was a big flop, thus they had to reengineer their algorithm. OpenAI/ChatGPT was better, but it was very effective for STEM based questions, not so much humanistic unless you gave it questions to ""prime"" the context of what you were ultimately going to ask it. 
There will be AI for different tasks as this technology isn't ""Free"" in terms of resource utilization. You don't need a fully fledged English language learning model to knows the entirety of human history if it's a plug-in for how to network Google Cloud Platform virtual machines to an Azure SQL Managed Instance back-end with failover capability using replication on AWS EC2 SQL Server instances. It's simply not relevant for *that specific AI model* . 
Frankly, the bigger piece that's missing from this Op/Ed is the quantum computing component that will ultimately drive AI when QC becomes developed enough for widespread use. *There will be a seismic shift* in wealth and the potential to benefit from that if you understand how to navigate/use a quantum computer. That will be the technology that will largely allow AI to be as ""efficient and useful"" as what's explained by all these people that were interviewed. 
Once these two technologies coalesce, the world economy will be driven by either skills that can drive and develop those technologies, *or* skills that will make automation/robotic replacement *very difficult* simply due to engineering limitations of the time (plumbing, electricians, litigation attorneys/Judges are examples). Plumbers and electricians will eventually be replaced by robots but the engineering limitations won't make that a reality for sometime, much less affordable for most companies to purchase on a wide scale. You'd also need people to maintain those machines until they're replaced by robots.
It'll be maybe a generation before you see a very dramatic shift with AI alone, QC will speed that up dramatically once they proliferate and are easier to access (hint: QCs already exist, but very limited quantities exist and their current use is basically for highly transactional systems, but once they start applying AI models to them, it'll be a very different ball game).",2024-04-02T12:30:43Z

Actually increasing the quality of life for everyone, instead of just maximising wealth for the few and stress and hardship for everyone else.",2024-04-02T12:35:28Z

I can get a better lesson on math in youtube than I can from how most teachers teach it. I can get better and more expert advice from someone on youtube about how to fix or make something then I can from most educators and trade schools more concerned for their profits and degree mills. So many industries have opened themselves up to replacement by being just so terrible at their jobs or at the very least inconsistent. 

If you were to raise your child to learn math you would want the best teacher they can have right? what if a AI program is the better teacher? the better nurse? the better surgeon? and can do so faster and cheaper then its competition? Should I deny that child a better education when other nations will not?

Its all fun and games until you realize you will be handicapping your nation and its people by not allowing them the best tools/equipment to do the job. As for jobs being replaced, look around just your town/neighborhood there is PLENTY of work to be done on every block, and enough work worldwide to fill the next billion years of labor and human effort.

We invented clothes & housing to replace our fur and made shoes and roads to protect our feet.
With tools and weapons we extended our arms & hands abilities and increased our efficiency and strength.
With aggriculture we streamlined food production and started to generate surplus.
With writing we revolutionized our way of learning, we extended our memory and communication.
With all kinds of machines we increased our strength and speed and precision by orders of magnitude.
We learned how to make use of the laws of nature, split atoms, fuse them, we even travelled to space.

With AI we're now finally outsourcing our minds.
Our ingenuity, critical thinking, systems thinking, innovative capacity.
We're outsourcing learning, imagination, curiosity, maybe even our perception of the universe.

Look up the history of hog tying people predominately racist behavior actually now go out there and tell a black man like myself. It’s not that bad of an image ha ha funny funny. That’s not how I feel when I see it. I think of my ancestors who not so long ago were treated like this tied by law enforcement in America and mistreated despite being US citizens. No for a candidate running for president to show an image of his rival in this position who just so happens to be the president of the United States. I think it is something you shouldn’t show on TV. We’re talking about the office of President of the United States. There are certain areas of humor of decency where we shouldn’t go certain things you just shouldn’t say certain things you just shouldn’t do. This is one of those things. Don’t get me wrong it’s not that big of a deal in the grand scheme of things but it should’ve never been done, it should’ve been one of those things were when somebody was ready to make this image they should’ve said you know what it’s not that the people wouldn’t approve of this if that my mother wouldn’t approve of this or my father wouldn’t approve of this, they would say no that’s That’s too much",2024-04-02T10:22:32Z

For the time being, humans and AI/Robots will work side by side until newer models standardize and replace humans entirely. There will be new jobs for people, but I am sure there will be a time-consuming job or babysitting the AI/robot on a production line.

Or, an equal sharing of the proceeds from fees that we should charge to industries when they extract natural resources, emit pollution or otherwise degrade environmental quality.

Our income from work should not be our sole source of income. We should respect PUBLIC property rights along with PRIVATE property rights. No one should face a threat of becoming destitute depending on their employment status.

If natural wealth is shared, workers will have more latitude to leave employment situations that they find objectionable for whatever reason. (Workers can only be oppressed because we thus far do NOT respect public or shared property rights.)

Charging fees proportional to environmental impacts, then sharing fee proceeds equally, would promote sustainability AND end poverty. The change is WAY overdue. We could have a more honest and fair political-economic system.",2024-04-02T09:15:10Z
2024-04-02T09:15:03Z,@atillerman5843,20TAkcy3aBY,"What we now call AI has been around since the 80s when those of us in on the basement of computers downloaded Photoshop and other programs that altered reality. The media has just given it a label, like they did changing ""kidnapping"", prostitution, and other people who take advantage of others as ""human trafficking"". I guess so it seems less horrendous than it is. Yes, I remember the 80s when the first computers came to my workplace and the instructors told us ""computers would give us a ""paperless workplace"", making those onerous and repetitive paperwork duties so much easier for all of us, as all we needed to do was point and click on boxes and easily type over mistakes (saving paper we'd usually crumple up and put in ""the round file"", and save it ""on a cloud"" saving billions in file cabiners and staffing to file and find these papers when appropriate. Instead, we've seen AI used to eliminate repetitive low skill jobs, and created MORE PAPER, as WE as workers found it necessary to PHOTOCOPY important files and FILE them somewhere WE could easily locate them in the future, to save us from dealing with what was on those papers when someone up the food chain either purposely deleted the reports or files, and WE (employees) need to prove WE did our jobs. SO in reality computers often created more problems and scheduling issues than before. For example when I was in HIGH SCHOOL, in the early 70s, our school system went from manually created report cards (we got a ""day off"" from classes) as our Homeroom teachers gathered paperwork from ALL our teachers, and transcribed ther grades onto our report card,. This usually fell on a Friday and on the following Monday, our report cards were handed out, we ""delivered"" them to our parents, who signed them (my mother usually signed them with the now NON politically correct but legal name she acquired when she said ""I do"" to my father, as MRS RAY *******. Yes in the 60s and  70 s she accepted that she was no longer Helen *********, but ""property"" of my father, and head of our household, Mr Ray L ******. During a recent painting of the house, we stumbled upon these ""historical documents"" and my daughter found out ""dad"" was not as smart as hed been portrayed for her 36 years, but in a day when failing to turn in homework put a ZERO in a teacher's grade book, and failing a test or exam did not leave me with a  60% as my grade if I failed, but if there were 100 questions and I missed 60 of them, the grade was a 40, which dragged down all my other grades that semester even further. Recently a local scandal was exposed by the news when they found out a newly hired Superintendent decreed 60 was the worst grade a teacher could give because state aid and passing the state required ""SOLs"" (Standards of Learning) requirements were based on the gross number of a school's passing (C or better) students determines IF schools individually are state certifed. State law allows parents of students in ""failing"" schools to demand their urchins be transferred to CERTIFIED schools (of which there currently NO Middle schools that passed in my city). So we could charge our school system of ""cooking their books"".",2024-04-02T09:15:03Z

You see, I love technology and inventions. Gadgets! Gizmos! Contraptions! Computer wizardry! Big machines! Little machines! Robots! These things naturally inspire glee in us. It’s the creative problem solving involved, the tactile feedback of interacting with specialised tools and parts, the sense of anticipation and accomplishment, the wonderment in seeing otherwise impossible things occur. Getting absorbed in fashioning new tools and tricks is this fantastic emergent element of the human species. It’s something we should be able to celebrate…

But there’s something about the Silicon Valley ethos, which has permeated our culture over the last two decades, that seems bafflingly out of touch with all of that. Apple, for example, has legitimised the practice of sealing off the inner-workings of their products from customers, practically forbidding repair and punishing anyone who tries to experiment with or extend their product in any way besides the ones they have already thought of and approved.

Social media giants like Facebook have stripped away the vibrant customisation and self expression that flourished in the earlier internet, where people would make their own custom webpages decorated colourfully with decals and wacky fonts. Now the sleek, sterile, inoffensive design languages of the companies who monopolise our online spaces are forced on the users. You’re lucky if you can choose a custom header. Information on how to make websites is now focused on ‘looking professional’, even if it’s a personal website, because we must always be thinking of the face we are putting on for potential employers or business partners.

VR emerges, and it’s really neat! But while it shows massive potential in creating worlds of escapism and recreation, for some reason we’re being told that what we really want to buy these headsets for is… corporate zoom meetings? And… working in Excel?

And with AI, as with the ill conceived ‘Metaverse’, concepts that sci fi has been grimly warning us of for decades are talked about with bizarre, uncritical enthusiasm by hypemen and spokespeople who apparently all watched Blade Runner thinking it was depicting a _utopia._ They seem to advocate for total capitulation to all technological developments, regardless of how they work, what the dangers are or what kind of a world they might create. 

“This thing we’ve built might cause problems? Hmm, you might have a point there, but we’re going to sell it anyway because we’ve got hungry shareholders to feed and $50 million in loans to pay back.”

In Big Tech, every new idea, every invention, is immediately understood through the lens of industry, marketing and monetisation. Nothing can exist if it cant be tied back to generating profit. The any notions of the world outside the boardroom are basically just hypotheticals. Interesting thought experiments, but immaterial when viewed next to this quarter’s earnings report. 

How can the spirit of tinkering and experimentation survive in an environment like that? Why build something actually helpful when you can use technology _cause problems,_ and then sell desperate people expensive solutions that barely work? Why foster a spirit of genuine collaboration, or work to make useful, beneficial tech more widely available when you can patent everything, squash competing vendors and make the whole world dependent on what you make, regardless of how crumby or poisonous it is. 

It’s a cult of callous, incurious snake oil salesmen blindly scuttling towards the scent of money. Grifters swapping tips on how to act more like a computer virus than a human being. All the while fancying themselves geniuses because they have the cash to pay smarter, poorer people to build widgets for them. The joy comes not from creating or learning, but from scoring and dominating. Constant exposure to their greed has, in recent years, gently soured the dreams of the little kid inside me who eagerly sketched designs for robots in their exercise book.",2024-04-02T09:07:37Z
2024-04-02T09:07:27Z,@TheKrispyfort,20TAkcy3aBY,"Hey, I have a lot of great ideas and theories that I'd love the chance to study. 

Who wants to gimme a full ride PhD research scholarship so I can test out my theories? 

Promise to write down what I find out and figure out so other people can know it, too. 
I'll do it in the form of a multiple chapter essay. A thesis if you will. 
I'll even tell you all about it over coffee, or a PowerPoint presentation, whatevs, and answer any questions you have about it and I'll try not to come across as precious about the ""thesis"" but I will defend it. 

I've done one before, but it was a little one. Like, only 50 pages, or so. I did get top marks. First Class even. But it was assessed by people who were totally unassociated with my uni, let alone me. They had no skin in the game. 
Maybe they were just being nice 🙂

1. They're going to fire everyone they can fire.
2. Then they're going to tell the survivors that they're all going to have to take a pay cut, and if they don't like it they can go and try and find another job. 
3. But of course the survivors can't find another job. Because the job market just got flooded by all the people who just got fired.
And then they'll do the same thing again with the next group. The only solution is a universal basic income, and strict controls over non-elastic markets like rent, healthcare, banking etc.

Australia's Federal Government left its social security service ""Centrelink"" under the care of AI. 
It resulted in a plethora of struggling people to be issued with debt determinations and demands for repayment. 

Vulnerable people who couldn't take the psychological shock & injury from receipt of a debt notice for financial assistance that the AI claimed they weren't entitled to, went on to escape the debt by ceasing to breathe.

Australians and Australian media labelled the situation ""ROBODEBT""

Oh sure, but then we once again have to compete with AI since it is currently training to become indistinguishable from human created art. And then your creative expression will be the fuel to imporve the AI art even more.
Look, I'm all for some technology making our lives easier, but since we are living in a capitalist society the reality is that when work gets easier to do and thus productivity rises, those who do the work don't benefit from it in the long run. On the contrary, not having to ""work so hard"" to achieve something will come with reduced pay or even being declared obsolete and let go. And this is very different from the coal workers who lose their jobs because their entire industry has no place in the world anymore. Because AI doesn't make work go away, it takes work away, work that still needs to be done but has been decided should be done by an AI instead. Leaving the human who originally did the work without an income. It's literally the ancient conservative scare of ""they are coming to take our jobs"", but instead of Pablo from Haiti it is OpenAI.",2024-04-02T08:36:05Z

Now, consider the diminishing value of specialization. As automated systems advance, being an expert in a narrow field may soon be a liability. 

AI will decimate the traditional workforce, leaving only essential roles and a handful of decision-makers. In this environment, the question isn't if you'll lose your job to AI, only when. Rather than fearing job loss to AI, seize the moment to conceptualize groundbreaking initiatives that will become attainable as AI advances. Your limitations are about to be shattered; what will you do when the unimaginable becomes your toolkit? 

In essence, this AI mirrors our mind's quick-thinking 'system 1', spitting out immediate answers based on past data. But it's missing its 'system 2' - the thoughtful part of our brain that cross-checks and corrects when things go awry. As we build this network, expect AI capabilities to skyrocket. The power now lies in a broad understanding of how and why things work. That's your golden ticket in an age where a single individual can command what previously required teams.

Just look at sci-fi, and you'll see a reflection of the long-term expectation that AI would replace physical labor first, with art and ""creative"" endeavors being the ultimate human-only trait. In reality, the very first pre-ChatGPT AIs were already being trained to write coherent stories, which expanded to novels. Obviously now this includes most ""intellectual"" work too, which was also deemed seemingly unattainable.

Understanding that I may also be wrong, I will still say.. it's too late.

My advice to anyone reading this is that sadly the ship has sailed, but we can at least advocate for decentralization to prevent a few small actors (OpenAI/Microsoft, Google etc.) from having unrivalled power over our lives. He who controls the AI controls the future. 

If you see smaller players offering AIs that you actually own (eg. running on your own device, not their servers), then please support them. Not to be dramatic, but our future may well depend on the ability of smaller players to counteract the overbearing centralization efforts of huge corporations.

I would also say to support your local businesses who have not replaced humans with AI, but I know you and I probably won't. We said the same thing about not buying cheap imports to protect local industry. Any talk of people supporting more expensive human-created products or companies has sadly been disproved from history. I genuinely hope I am wrong about this though.

TL;DR: AI will replace your job and the best we can do is support decentralization to prevent a few corporations controlling everything.",2024-04-02T07:22:51Z

By the way, i don't think the AIs replacing labor is the problem here: the problem is that none of the current economic systems we have really take AIs into account. I am not an economist (not even close), but for example: as resources are scarce, humans compete for them, offering their force, knowledge or skills in exchange for those resources, and at least theoretically, the better you are, the more resources you can obtain. Now, what if AI somewhat finds a way to make productivity and efficiency so high that make possible all for all humankind to access almost any resource for free, so it makes ""paying"" obsolete?

If someone tells you that you can get 10x returns if you invest in index funds and don't touch it for a few decades, no one questions it. Current AI is being haphazardly applied with varying (usually low) degrees of success to replace some humans currently. You should check if anyone that is saying AI will replace a substaintial portion of the job market in the next few years is trying to sell you their AI tool. The real promise of AI, not by these grifters and headline seekers, is when AI actually becomes... intelligent. When AI transitions from being a tool for humans to use to save time/resources to something that can actually reason for itself, then and only then will it compete for large populations of the work force. That could take years (doubtful imo), decades, or perhaps won't happen in any of our lifetimes, no one knows for sure, and anyone who claims to be certain is either ill-informed or a grifter.

It may be computerized, but it is not sentient, it is not an alive thing making decisions. It is doing what it is made to do. So, when we think of tasks as being automated by AI, what does that really mean? 

AI is the new branding for ""computer programs."" Remember those? 

Programs had been rebranded to Applications by 2008. Now, pretty much any program can be considered an App, the concept of which is miles away from the Executables we're really describing. It's important not to distance yourself too much from our own common sense. Apps are computer software, literally programs, and many are written by literally purveyors of corporate law. 

They don't have artificial intelligence in corporate land, but they do have faith in their infinite growth. Corporate rule is a cancer in our legal system, transforming our government into a pro-corporate enforcement agency, stealing extra profit from underpaid workers and using it to (legally) bribe politicians, so that any law they pass should always be pleasant for corporations and limit the rights of humans who might seek justice against any corporation acting immorally. 

Corporate profits increase at the expense of our communities, and AI has nothing to do with it. The rebranding is a power grab, to help us all forget about them writing computer programs designed to manipulate us while padding their own pockets. Changing the framing from Apps to AI, gives the algorithm (or any other tool) that air of inevitability, as if programmers actually have little control over it. As if.

AI is definitely shaking things up by removing the ""middle guy"" in many industries. Here are some ways it's happening:

E-commerce: Recommendation algorithms suggest products directly to consumers, bypassing the need for salespeople.
Finance: Robo-advisors invest your money based on your goals, replacing traditional financial advisors.
Customer Service: Chatbots answer customer questions 24/7, eliminating the need for human representatives in some cases.
There are both pros and cons to this trend. Here's a quick breakdown:

Pros:

Increased efficiency: AI can automate tasks and processes, making things faster and cheaper.
Lower costs: Removing the middleman can lead to lower prices for consumers.
Convenience: AI is always available, providing 24/7 service.
Cons:

Job displacement: As AI automates tasks, some jobs will be lost.
Lack of human touch: AI can't replicate the empathy and understanding of a human interaction.
Bias: AI algorithms can perpetuate existing biases if not carefully designed.
Overall, AI is changing the way we work and do business. While it may remove some middlemen, it's also creating new opportunities.",2024-04-02T06:19:53Z

They posed this lovely image of workers getting more free time because this technology would make us all so much more productive. The problem is that it is the capital class who invests in the automation, so they feel that they should get all of the benefits. In fact, they get 100% of the benefits and then eat into our share of what we used to have, leading to declining real wages while maintaining the 40-hour work week. This was not what they sold us all on. It was bait & switch.

Conservatives like to talk about ""redistribution of income"" to describe the working class just trying to stay even, let alone get ahead a tiny bit. The thing is that it is the capital class that has been redistributing income, but they have been redistributing it to themselves. This is not a long-term sustainable trend. Working class people need to be able to afford the necessities of life as a minimum, and having some money left over for some wants and not just needs is not an unreasonable request, especially given the high ratio of wants to needs consumed by capitalists. We need a system that works for all, not just for the dwindling percentage who have ""made it."" ""Redistributing"" some of that income back to those capitalism is redistributing it away from is absolutely essential. If there are gains to be made from this technology, we all should share in those gains.",2024-04-02T06:09:06Z

The printing press. The loom. The cotton gin. The sewing machine. The telephone. The harvester. The automobile. In more recent times, the computer. Software tools. Robotics in manufacturing. Autonomous vehicles. There are a hundred more examples, I'm sure.

In all cases, these changes are disruptive. They can reshape or eliminate entire industries or classes of workers. This is challenging and life-changing for the people impacted. But to argue ""progress is disruptive, therefore stop the progress"" is neither smart nor viable. Notice that nobody who frets about AI ""coming for our jobs"" wants to roll back the clock and become a scribe, or a subsistence farmer, or a lamp lighter -- or a human calculator, stableman, or switchboard operator. We must move forward. We must also structure our governments and societies in a way to protect individuals from the worst impacts of these changes. (As a country, we do a poor job of this relative to our peers, unfortunately.)

This time will not be different. It is hubris to imagine that this new technology will be the first one to displace workers so dramatically that we'll all be walking around looking for something to do. New industries are born; new jobs and skills are needed. It has ever been thus, and so it will be with AI. And it's not coming ""on Thursday""; AI has already been in development for decades, and it will be many more decades before much of the promise (and peril) can be realized. Don't buy the hype that these tech executives are selling.

Tone & Style: The comedic/satirical tone is well executed through humor, sarcasm and ridicule of certain views. Lines are cleverly crafted for maximum satirical effect.
Content:  The content critiques real issues around AI job disruption debates in an engaging manner using relevant examples. It picks apart claims in a thought-provoking way.
Structure: As a transcript dialogue, it follows a logical back-and-forth flow between speakers that builds the critique over time in an understandable progression. 
Organization: Though conversations may detour for comedic impact, each new topic or argument builds logically on the last to reinforce the overall satirical message about AI impacts.
Audience/Purpose: The purpose is to engage and inform audiences on AI issues through an entertaining critical lens, not simply state facts. As satire its aim is to get people thinking not just nodding along. 
Originality:  While drawing from real topics, the creative jokes, scenarios and dramatized dialogue bring a fresh humorous perspective compared to more standard analyses.

Overall, as a work of satire/parody its hyperbolic style, witty content, coherent structure and attention-grabbing originality evaluatively achieve the genre's goal of critiquing its subject through provocative humor meant to both entertain and insightfully analyze its timely topic. It is an effective use of the satire format.

The thing is, I would kind of prefer if people clarified if they wanted to regulate AI or get rid of it because a lot of people in the former category sound like they would be in the latter category.

Also, I’m one of the folks surprised a joke wasn’t made about a simple solution to AI, having something like Universal Basic Income. I mean, why does no one talk about that? Sure, I get why capitalist leaders wouldn’t talk much about this, but what about the crowd concerned about AI?

2024-04-02T05:59:03Z,@TheTuubster,20TAkcy3aBY,"Here are some key stakeholders that could be affected by this video, along with an evaluation of the potential impacts:

- AI developers/proponents - The video mocks and criticizes their job disruption claims and retraining arguments. This critical evaluation could undermine their public messaging and policy ambitions. 
- Displaced workers - It amplifies concerns these workers may have about real job prospects. While potentially validating worries, it does not offer solutions. 
- General public audiences - The satire gets people entertainingly thinking about AI issues, but runs the risk of polarization by appealing more to emotions than facts. It could spread skepticism rather than understanding.
- Policymakers - The critique of retraining as inadequate could inform policy debates, but the tone may turn some off or be dismissed as partisan instead of constructive. Facts are implied but not proven.
- Media outlets - News organizations focusing heavily on AI optimism are held up for ridicule, which challenging established narratives could impact their work. 
- Companies implementing AI - By raising doubts about the full economic and social impacts revealed so far, it could meet resistance from or face backlash within industries pursuing AI for profit motives.

Overall, while engaging various audiences to think more critically, the confrontational satirical format carries risk of emotion over substance and unintended consequences if misunderstood. However, as entertainment it effectively sparks broader debate, even if solutions remain undefined. A balanced approach incorporating its insights alongside additional perspectives could maximize benefits and minimize harms.

And before someone says let's stop AI, know that you can't.

Unfortunately under capitalism, that will never be the case - the sole beneficiaries are ultra rich capitalists who use automation to cut workers, increasing the pool of desperate unemployed workers, which allows them to drive down wages.

In fact, no one can file themselves anymore because of the complexity, yet the laws that were meant to make sure ""everyone paid their share"" has companies like Amazon paying $0.

The scientists create AI.  The public instantly fears the potential of machines thinking like people.  The machines do miraculous feats that aid humans to improve life everywhere.  Humans take the machines for granted.  AI replaces scientists with AI that helps it develop increasingly better AI, which becomes self-aware on August 27th.
It's either that, or we start waking up in what turns out to be 3020, not knowing how long our entire reality has been a software simulation built to keep us alive enough to charge AI smart phones and power the Matrix that subjegates all of humanity.

Nobody is talking about it in the media at all. A lot of companies, especially modern app companies, are getting hopeful new writers to write full and detailed outlines with even up to half an entire script before agreeing to a contract. They then turn them down, steal their work, run it through this software to change it enough to avoid copyright laws, then they pay some teenager peanuts to correct and adjust. The product is different enough to pretend similarities were coincidence, but also badly written and soulless, removing any kind of worthwhile meaning or often even basic craft to anything.

It's absolutely appalling what this software is now being used for and nobody can really prove it, especially when more and more people are now working for companies that are based overseas and all over the place. I think we are now reaching the actual fabled tipping point where our technology will either free us (ie, from the necessity to work in order to have basic shelter, food and clothing) or it will do the opposite at the hands of rapidly dominant corporations, billionaires and the patsy politicians they help put in place to facilitate them.",2024-04-02T06:37:11Z

Hence, the new joiners to the labour market will keep to be disadvantaged than the previous generations.

It's interesting, because I've tried talking to AI about this - and AI will follow the logical argument for a prosperous AND sustainable future powered by abundant clean energy from magma, but then immediately revert to some average of the body of knowledge it is trained upon; referencing 50 years of environmentalist thought couched exclusively in terms of limits to growth!",2024-04-02T04:54:00Z

Same as they did protests against Iraq before the internet turned ordinary media obsolete now they are never ever bringing up how jobs are vanishing or being subsidized by the government so corporations don't have to pay workers. Now with ai literally the corps will get to a point where the ai will do the job much better than humans and that keeping humans even if their salaries are 100% subsidized won't be worth the loss in quality and optimization. The government will have to buy the job availability from the corporation by giving them 150% of the workers salary. This town i live in the majority of the jobs are 80% paid salaries from the government. The companies cannot compete if they pay salaries & soon they won't even be able to afford getting the free labor either.,2024-04-02T04:41:56Z

2024-04-02T04:37:49Z,@LightningArts,20TAkcy3aBY,"AI techbros promise it will fix everything and provide us with a star trek future of everyone being able to do anything we want. If all these billionares decided to altruistically give up 60% of their wealth or.. actually be taxed properly for having it, it would solve tons of problems for everyone right now. But they aren't actually interested in doing that.  These same people are rich beyond comprehension and all these AI things being added to the pile are doing is making them even *richer*.

They say they will fix climate change? AI literally is making it worse with the power draw it's pulling. 

They say ""it will create brand new jobs!"" but the only jobs they can ever come up with are jobs of babysitting the AI. Which will require less people and is also mind numbingly worse.

We're told it will make things better for everyone, here are a list of objectively bad things it's doing instead:
-Making it harder to tell fact from fiction in images, writing, sound, videos
-Increasing distrust from everyone because now you don't know what is real or fake
-Increasing spam on the internet 
-increasing malware on the internet
-increasing and empowering scammers 
-flooding digital stores with generated garbage that isn't even real to buy
-flooding reviews to generate fake ones so reviews lose all meaning
-generating fake voice clones of real people and tricking parents into thinking their real child is kidnapped
-Pushing new creatives (a budding writer, artist, music and etc) out of trying at all because they see it as pointless now
-Pushing completely unrealistic and impossible standards because fake images are put forth as real, which makes real accomplishments seem lackluster by comparison
-Putting out tons of false information that it ""hallucinates"", which is not fact checked and then put forward as real information from everything to schoolwork all the way up to government and scientific papers.
-increasing depression and suicidality

And that doesn't even get into the huge displacement of people having their lives upended by this- after stealing everything from them by scraping the entire internet, for no real gain except the business people wanting to make even more money. 

And all these people claim that it's going to be so great- while still needing even more money. MS is wanting to spend 100billion on a supercomputer farm. Sam Altman wants 7 trillion for AGI development. These people are psychotic, and anyone who thinks they have altruism in mind needs to pay attention.",2024-04-02T04:43:42Z

2024-04-02T04:21:28Z,@rowdyriemer,20TAkcy3aBY,"AI and automation in general will drastically change our economy. Our current economic system depends on even the lowest paid workers to be consumers. It's hard to participate in the economy at all if you don't have a job. 

This means not only will the middle class shrink, but so will the rich, as consumption dwindles. Automation may allow for the rich to trade amongst each other, but those who own the automation will be those who have already accumulated large amounts of secure capital and can adapt to this change. They will produce their own goods and services for each other, and most of the rest of us won't even be useful as slaves - we'll just be in their way. And it's easy to imagine what happens then.

Or perhaps we fight now to make sure (if it's possible) that automation resources are controlled by the masses and work to everyone's benefit. 

Either way, capitalism as we know it will fall. What do we want post-capitalism to look like?",2024-04-02T04:21:28Z

WRONG! 
The correct answer is PHEV plug-in hybrid to serve 65% future EV needs. All-battery BEV serves the  remainder in lightweight and short-distance travel/transport needs. PHEV tech is especially applicable to long-haul freight trucks. PHEV tech distributes resources (battery, PV solar arrays, combustible hydrogen) far more equitably than BEV and HFCEV tech.

When a technology is invented that is capable of doing labor currently done by humans, faster, better, and cheaper…what are we supposed to do with it?  We don’t want people to lose their jobs, but at the same time, it’s terribly inefficient to support a vastly inferior industry full of human labor when technology exists that can do it better.

For example, would it have been better if we decided not to build a railroad so we wouldn’t put the farrier and horse breeding industries out of business?  Should we still be out on farm fields with hand tillers because animal drawn ploughs would put too many farmers out of work?

I mean, look I’m sorry to say it, but if AI winds up doing level 1 support better than human technicians, then they’re going to be replaced, and they should be replaced.

The issue here isn’t the technology, it’s the fact that the rich and corporations benefit from new technology far more than the working class, and the working class often suffers as technology takes their jobs and they are left out in the cold.

ChatGPT3.5: It's challenging to predict with certainty which sectors of the economy will be entirely unaffected by the implementation of AI in the workforce. However, some sectors may be less impacted due to the nature of their work or the complexity of tasks involved. Here are a few examples:

    Healthcare: While AI can augment certain aspects of healthcare such as diagnostics and administrative tasks, the human element of patient care and decision-making is likely to remain crucial.

    Creative industries: Fields like art, music, literature, and design rely heavily on human creativity and expression, which AI struggles to replicate fully.

    Personal services: Jobs that involve personalized and direct human interaction, such as personal trainers, therapists, and counselors, may be less susceptible to automation.

    Education: Teaching and mentoring require complex interpersonal skills and adaptability to individual student needs, making it challenging for AI to fully replace human educators.

    Some niche industries: Certain specialized or highly customized sectors where tasks require a high degree of creativity, adaptability, or human judgment may also be less affected by AI.

However, it's important to note that while certain sectors may be less impacted by AI in terms of job displacement, they could still experience changes in workflow, efficiency, and job roles due to the integration of AI technologies. Additionally, the pace of AI development and adoption is rapid, so even these sectors may not remain entirely untouched in the long term.",2024-04-02T03:44:49Z

It's akin to hating crypto without comprehending the underlying blockchain technology.

Jon. You'll eventually be able to implant a chip into your brain, this chip will detect and transmit an idea you have via signals to a computer, these signals will be interpreted by transformer technology (AI), the response will be machine code that would then display your idea. You'll be able to test your idea in a virtual world, then you can bring your idea out into the world, many ways, think an advanced 3d printer that handles multiple raw materials and have articulating arms to assemble something.

There will be many iterations of this technology along the way.

The future jobs would be a bit more than prompt engineering...

We already don't all need to work for society to function - we've just collectively convinced ourselves ""that's how it is"".  But with AI we could have a fraction of the current workforce employed at any one time and be just fine even if we were just giving away money to everyone else.  Or we could cut back work to just one or two days a week, or have weekly rotations.  AI could free many millions of people from being pressured to work pointless jobs, give so much free time and chances at self improvement.

But we all know that won't happen.  The Industrial Revolution showed us that - you remove jobs, you push people further into poverty, you force them into worse and worse pointless jobs.  The more the people are forced to fight to survive the less time they have to ask questions about how society is run.  And those in charge do not want that - which is why they blatantly lie about how much they themselves work in order to convince people too tired or apathetic to question it to just 'be content' with the hand forced upon them.",2024-04-02T03:42:48Z

But then he completely misrepresents the potential of AI systems with the cheap jokes. It's not AI that brings ethical issues, it just amplifies the ethical issues we already have in this absurd late stage capitalism society we live in. THAT'S the problem, not AI. Whether we have AI or not it's this late stage capitalism mindset that will eventually bring our destruction.
