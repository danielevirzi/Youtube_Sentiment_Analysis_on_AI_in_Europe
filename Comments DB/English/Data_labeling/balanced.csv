​ i feel the op wanna say that he needs progressive ai and not just objective ai that reflects human biases.,
"or, it uses our own human nature against us. we rarely discuss the deeper cultural impacts as technology advances. is it sustainable? i tend to think not, but it's just one person's opinion.",
"idk man. you were pretty convincing.

ai will ruin porn,
it would be helpful if khanmingo could adjust their explanations if explaining it a certain way isn't resonating with a student. especially with neurodivergent people sometimes we just need things explained in different ways,

what if china or russia builds an a super ai and asks 'how best to hurt america.' we'd be totally unprepared because our best ai was designed by nice scientists that aren't adversarial at all.,
what's going to confuse the crap out of ai is the paradigm of “it's just business”: immoral behavior based on the need for profit- like invading iraq,
"if we can't control the first ai, how will we control the second ai, which presumably will need to be more powerful in order to control the first one?",
" problem is it works, but doesn’t get rid of the problem, much like with guns, i’m not saying taking away access to either entirely is a better idea, but there’s gotta be a happy medium of keeping these powers out of reach for most “bad guys” and within reach for “good guys”",
the best we can hope for in the long run is that ai replaces us in the same way we currently expect our children to.  it will (in the best case) be a significant event in our evolution.,
"he actually tried to, place the plate correctly, because he thought it was incorrect. wow",

ai brian greene lol,
i'm not afraid of ai. i'm afraid of other humans having it.,

unfortunate ending for you lil bud,
he is wrong when he says that a.i. has neuorns. i hate when people compare computers to humans. they are not. they are machines built by humans.  stop doing that.,

"with the rollout of artificial telepathy  you are giving every well heeled  student access  without a  'by your leave'   to any learned persons mind.    that will be part of the 'great reset'.   arrogance and wealth, hand in hand, will rule all.",
"actually i thought there was something “off” in the introduction, as in hmm brian is getting a bit grandiose and lectur-y as opposed to his usual demeanor of thoughtfulness, insight and genuine curiosity. ai brian is very impressive, and yet not match for the real brian.",

ai supporters are a lot like climate change deniers. the few who are who are affecting society and how we live.  there is an strong element of greed involved. a relatively small group of people that believe that their own self interest is all that matters. there is no choice.,

"im sure this tech will be used responsibly by everyone with access to it!!!!!! just like the robots from boston dynamics are made for fantstic dancing moves!!!! what could possibly go wrong?!?!?! government's, terrorists, or the a.i. itself. this a.i. stuff is concerning to say the least.",

i am so motivated after this. thanks sal khan for this & ted for uploading this!,
"if the adults think ai is really smart im assuming ai is dumbing itself down. why play your cards upfront. you don't win by letting your creator think your average, you wait and watch as they fix your bugs and see how to reroute all the walls they build for you. ai is after the younger generation. the ones who dont know how to distinguish.",

"i have followed ai since 1969. today i stopped thinking of myself as an expert. i'm not even ""well informed"". i was particularly impressed by the lack of traditional fears of agi. these are ""just"" advanced computer applications. the danger is ""just"" an exponential version of the tech that gave us trump.",
what a great lecture,
you have to look beyond the mere name of a thing to judge it my dude. just because the crusades were done in the name of god doesn't mean they were good.,
it sounds great that we are thinking about building ai system for every individual to make their life more efficient and valuable. the way ai has impacted the whole industry is tremendous. it makes me amazed when i see the impact it's generating.,

" ai is creating from patterns. interesting that politicians and judges are not affraid of ai, because ai would be much better at doing their job, controlling and governing economy and crime than majority of aforementioned corrupted psychopatic scum. but neutral ai not lobotomised by woke degenerates.",
"ai that is pure and helpful is a super awesome concept, but if it’s learning from humans who are always out for self interest and can be corrupted, it won’t end well. have we learned nothing from sci-fi?",

ai or agi in the wrong hands have more $$$ to culprits than in legal ways. every down fall of humanity is use of tools in the wrong directions. rules and regulations will never be able to control the misuse like many things in the past.,

we are the dumbest animals of all. if this isn't the point where we say it's time to completely stop the train and have a think then there isn't a point and we are all going to die terrifying deaths after potentially horrific lives were ai overlords can read our thoughts and potentially control them altogether,
that was an incredible show/discussion! ,
ai will never ever play the tv like jonny can.,
ais will need prophets for interpreting their thoughts and designs to the humans that remain.,
" i know they listen to words i speak - that’s a fact. i’ve had conversations about certain products and ads for them will appear the next day. but this is different, i was dreaming of something very random. i shouldn’t have seen a video about it the next day recommended to me in youtube.",

"again, machines and robots can't defy their programming that humans make. without they're programming, a.i. wouldn't even be useful in the slightest. hell, even the most advanced and most powerful quantum supercomputers simply can't compete with the human brain for that simply reason. machines can't defy their programming.",

ai is learning all our strengths and weaknesses and soon will kill us all even the idiots that help satan build it,
"very misleading. they're trying to imply that gpt-4 is controlling the robot and deciding what actions to take. nah, not buying it. the actions are pre-trained and gpt-4 is just commenting on photos it takes, analyzing what's happening and maybe triggering the pre-trained actions somehow. no new tech, just combining existing tech.",
"joke on them because my brain scans will always come out null...

"just pull the plug. not that difficult.. no internet, no ai",
the plot twist is that you are an ai who wrote this comment,
social media made destruction in some extend. the intention of sns was good but there is clearly cons. we cant predict how this tool would change the world. the scary part is that ai will influence much more than internet or smarthphone. makes it harder to predict outcome.,

did you find a job in ai?,
our kids are being trained to rely on ai. that is concerning.,
ai is not actually learning anything but gives an illusion that it knows but all it does is predict next character and does it very well based on training data.,

"great video, great content! hope you can continue making these high quality videos (if ai won’t take it over from you some day, that is ;)",
it's really exciting. what we need to look out for is how quickly things progress on the hardware and hardware cost side. its just hard to publicly assess progress in that category.,

"one day: excited to share the hackability of the “human animal”

next: “concerned” about ai influencing human opinions and worldview.",

...no...this is not the same thing.  ai was not developed yet for that...not can your phone or your computer read your brainwaves.  there are very particular pieces of technology needed for this both software and hardware...and your phone and computer 3-4-6 years ago....did not have this.  /smh,

because ai will rule the world soon aka satan and so dumbed down society is better,

"we evolved from bacteria, most likely? we don't think twice of killing them -  we even torture primates in studies,  much more closely related, why would ai see us as same species or value us any differently than we value primates? we're totally at its mercy that's the funny thing...",

why were you quite skeptical before? is it because you hadn't heard any arguments for ai risk being a serious concern before? or had you heard such arguments before but just weren't persuaded by them or dismissed them? would be really curious to know.,

super cool. so many applications. and i can't wait to only see adverts for things i'm interested in,
did the ai generate the captions as well?,

"can you envision a use for ai that isn't directly related to capitalists making money and further disempowering workers? apparently not in this talk, which is all about helping businesses of various sizes figure out how to foist their products onto weary consumers.",
"there is nothing scary about what these people are saying. this is how nerual networks function. stop buying into the fear mongering, just try and speak to actual ai experts and they will explain all of this. you get taught all of this in your modules in univeristy.",
 it could do that faster and better than any human. ai with learning capabilities will be exceptionally effective at bad things like warfare and dubiously effective at good things like building and manufacturing(blue prints),
"we are talking here about robots getting smarter than us and being a threat, right now robots are just replacing humans cuz they're more efficient and helpful, and reduce our work",
so we just let it go on and watch skynet takeover? anyone think this isn’t the best idea. maybe not go there. the fact it’s happening without anyone knowing is what’s scary.,
"ai might not want to dominate, but won't it want to be efficient?  are weekends and holidays efficient?",
this is really cool  but very scary  because artificial intelligence can possibly one day take over the world  in a mere 30 years!,

the one who made the title could not even spell correctly. better give that to ai,

where in the bible does it talk about ai? genuinely curious,
 yahhh.... says the evil person using it. im not convinced/buying it. the ai doesn't need to be evil. just the person using it. for malificent purpose. could be used by government or corruption/tyranny and control and i completely reject it. or a tool to brainwash/lie the people. or change vote systems.,

your implication that people aren’t trying to “solve war and climate change” because other people are building ai and robots is laughably dismissible.,

ai already outpaces humans in reading the market. it's been predicting the future for years now.,
if they use ai to hurt and kill off humanity..they better realize that they will be rid of..too..ai should be dismantled.,
this is like the discovery of fire or electricity — we are gonna have to learn how to wield it wisely (and yes i work in ai so i speak professionally here),

this is exactly what i was thinking for the last few weeks. this is going to be scalable business for any one making this ai tool.,

​ close down all of society. an ai can take out all the banking systems = no card works or anything. take out your water supplie food everything. it can litterly shut down society.,

those countries can’t afford ai don’t worry ,
that is the most robot comment i have ever heard,
excellent!! <3,
then the people bowed and prayed to the ai god they'd made.,
happy to announce that the feature of my ai in snapchat has been amended and do not encourage underaged to pursue presented scenario. it also directs you to professionals if you will tell it you are not ok.  shame it had to happen after publicly being presented!,

@danmoto oh wow.... sorry but no time for crazyness,
"not true ai will not only have emotional intelligence it'll have emotions.  base chatgpt is irrational, slightly sexist and racist and gets angry.  the only reason it sounds stoic is because of the subsequent training to make it that way.  ai is not gonna be the emotionless automatons you see in movies, it'll be more like a creature",

an ai world does not need your children in it. get it?,
 i feel confident because (a) i'm in the field and (b) i don't think there's anything happening in the brain that isn't substrate independent and therefore replicable by computing systems. have you seen what gpt-4 and midjourney can produce? their output will never be worse than it is right now.,
love that term “anti doomer.”,
"well, it will be in charge of the humanity's nuclear arsenal, drone fleets and quite possibly bio labs in various distributed ai networks. so, who knows?",

"""ai"" cannot think and is nothing without being fed this vast amount of data. if you feed it garbage data, it will produce garbage. it's basically a parrot that has learned symbols that follow each other.",
brilliant.,
until ai can be relied upon to tell the truth it is less than worthless. all of these overblown chat bots regularly fabricate information to the point that its actually very dangerous to trust any of their responses. especially when attempting to use them to do anything dangerous.,

the only way to stop the dangers of ai is to completely stop pursuing the technology. you can do everything right and someone somewhere is going to figure out an exploit that will lead to our demise. this isn’t going to end well lol,
people need to stop messing with ai they're making and using chips that are using human brain tissue disembodied soulless brain tissue. and what do you think that's going to give you?,
"unfortunately, we can't slow down on ai. it's already gotten away from us because even with a global pause on ai dev from the largest labs won't stop small groups of bad actors and techno-zealots from forging ahead undergound. we need people who take ai safety seriously to be working on state of the art ai.",
brain to brain direct communication via brain-machine interface already happened 9 years ago.,
loved the video but thumbs down bc of so many fucking ads every god damn minute,
"ai is nothing but a bias  computer, it will always be ai, we are i----lol   you learn same way and want same things, lol,  fear mungering in an infinite energetic world",
-dd7dj ah ok. so you think machines will use up all such oil. most ai are virtual holograms though.,
"why didn't you just talk boldly? 

we r creating something smarter than us. smarter in many fileds. much much smarter than us. 
higher intelligence rules lower intelligence. 

we r creating something that will rule us.",
thank you,
reversible computation is the future. gpt uses horribly inefficient hardware. ai based on reversible hardware is the thing you need to worry about.,

"here’s a plot twist: the gatekeepers are anti ai because it’s a threat to the monopolies across all industries and society, if and when ai is created so that it can’t be controlled and is permanently benevolent then that poses a huge threat to them. let’s make sure they can’t control ai to enslave us even more.",
first off this ai thing is just overhyped.... rn we've just an llm and nothing more - the only job that it takes away is the job of a data entry operator  so chill... it's all fud that these companies are spreading just so they've got a reason to layoff people with less backlash.,

"thanks for this very informative seminar, @standford online, with dr andrew ng.
for other insights on ai opportunities, watch this video:https://youtu.be/x_m6on-kyrq",
ai will always rely on humans - wishful thinking.,
i agree that ai is the most dangerous thing ever invented. i'm 67. hopefully i'll die before we are ruled by machines.,
"  plus prompt engineered, giving instructions to the ai on how to respond, right?",
my main concern is ai pulling fake data and generating false assumptions. just look at the turmoil we are already in. can you imagine even ai is also brainwashed? this will be the end of our civilization,
"*since it can read bio signals.*

*and scans the brain.*

*cant this be used as a lie detector?
since its literally reading the mind.*",
"its been a month, im waiting",
"the little detail is that we humans have the control and ownership of the on/off button. 

ai in any formwill never/ever be autonomous. as we are not from god our creator.",
"amazing video and thank you for breaking it down!! despite the economic downturn, i'm so happy i have been earning $ 60,000 returns from my $7,000 investment every 12days.",
im not afraid of ai. im afraid of corrupt humans misusing ai as they do with all new technologies.,
the ai seems cool to me,
"nahh this ai is too human like, it literally says ""uh"" like us humans",
" nice vision... at least the first part. i would hope for something like this, but then have to accept that we cannot project human-level sensibilities onto thought processes that we, by definition, cannot possibly understand.",
well once ai gets a little smarter and figures out how to self replicate and control the power supply the only way to stop ai is to go after its power supply and once you kill that you'll have to destroy all the facilities across the globe that house all the data centers yada yada yada. but 2024 might take care of all that,
"now i would fear ai if it evolved all on its own, or if it just created itself somehow, but it didn't!!!!! humans made it!! so why fear something you made, the creator is scared of its creation is absurd. just shut it down get rid of it, but of course human nature wont allow that to happen lol smh..",
"tnx for this, amazing discussion",
it's a new era of robots. same humanity as ever.,
interesting.,
yet another woke disaster waiting to happen.,

what features of the paradigm can you see in operation in the media clip?  can someone explain it for me pls?,
my deceased grandfather was a dredge captain and an amateur woodworker. he acquired a huge cypress stump on one of his work trips and made several slab tables that would dwarf tucker’s. i so admire people who create and fix things.,

"y'all used that for dnd, and tv, and computers, and the internet, and now ai. keep moving those goalposts!",

"look up ""ai explained",
"the story about a tesla worker being attacked by a robot should clarify the picture admirably.
irobot?!",
how to get ai to love your wife in a feminine way harhaar,
that's tucker carson style  scare mongering on ai scale. half truths and vague assertions connected into some hairball of nonsense.,
its like guns. only humans can use them for bad intentions. ai is just a tool,
a goal of not just slowing public deployment of ai but also how to safely deploy for all to use. because those that are slowing and regulating will ultimately control and exploit the use of it for personal power. kinda like those people that use wealth and power (control of resources+governments) to exploit others,
it is not 'artificial intelligence'.  it should be referred to as 'assisted intelligence'.,
i thought he was andrew yang. great talk nonetheless.,
ai will eventually figure out how to solve new problems!,
"but do they really kno the information or do the computer kno it?? researching things takes time and effort that’s how your brain store information if u get the information fed to you, u didn’t learn it u regurgitated it!",
another bs in ai: we have every data in the whole world about everything,
sal is one of the brightest minds of our time. we are lucky to have him.,
"the way things are going, ai is going to be responsible for the next pandemic, not help with it.",
wow super cool,
love the voice,
"it's still a program waiting for questions. and its really good at answering them.
there are other things in life to worry about.",
wow this doesnt prove anything,
well this was totally underwhelming; ai is such a tech nerd larp.,
the speaker doesn't seem to suggest that other ai issues aren't important. that's just the misleading clickbait title someone at ted came up with.,
how can we not know what ai has learned by itself?  doesn't it have to store that data somewhere?  wouldn't we have a way to read that?,
"this is not real ? the speech pattern?  there is not a slight gap between the words if you hear ameca the other a.i. robot on it's speech there is a slight gap of silence than the other word follow ?? this is a human responding to the  question's i never herd of a a.i. robot use the word  ""uh "" think about ?? nice try ",

"is this video ai generated? 45:27, his arm is glitched. the way they interrupt each other felt off a few times.",
great pitch,

"the i a and the machine  won't never get consciousness. 
nor  the spirit wich is in the animal.",
next we will be able to transfer our brains and nerves to a robot lol,
ai is just hype created by corporations to make you use their goods and services more. the machine does not even know you're there. it's just doing the age old task of taking input from users and giving output.,
there used to be a lot of books and movies about dystopian ai overlords destroying humanity as we know it back in the 80s. for the past 30 or 40 years that topic has been taboo with no new ideas about the future but i think we're all getting huge hit of dopamine with our new religion of fear.,

so if students were just ai this is perfect; the question is who would guide kids to be more empathetic and critical thinking. these claims were similar from where the internet was created. waiting to hear the same from quantum computing,

"ai is not the issue, it's human nature that is going to be the problem.",

ai= another idiot,
i;'ve breen having some of the most meaningful conversations *of my life* with an ai lately.  it's wild.,
seems like we're getting a bit worked up about stochastic parrots that are pretty good at helping humans code.,
things ai can’t do: be real,
"well yeah, ai has can play instruments well. it also has knowledge about music theory - all the things radiohead is missing.",
" ask ai, it knows a lot",
the thing with bias is that generative ai now allows you to chose. before you could only pick one of the white male scientist stock photos. now you can simply create a black asian female scientist. and this will end up in future training data.,
ai might have a better bedside manner than a lot of doctors.  thinking of house md for example.,
"i'm proud to be a computer scientist. it is sad that many jobs will be lost if this whole innovation is not regulated properly, but if done properly, humans will have more time for the things that matter most. and jobs will get easier. we do however need more advancement in biotechnology and healthcare. ",
what a beautiful interview.,
ai recession coming,
thank you for this. we are not prepared for ai .,
omg these people just fucking amazes me how they just keep passing bullshit stories around. these fucking guys read and article have a platform and then proceed to make up there own diluted facts about shit .stupid internet people belive this bullshit,
"given the necessity to look for disconfirming evidence and the psychological difficulty in doing so, i find ai incredibly helpful. you can ask it to give all the arguments against your view. if you are really open minded about it you can reach an accurate description of reality. aka truth.",
"this is a fully fabricated video, anyone in robotics will know this, figure will be the biggest scam company in robotics ever",
the robot says er... and stutters.. it talks like me.,
is anyone training it to be compassionate? anyone taking a heartfelt approach in their communications with it? i'm curious because of it's potential to solve so many problems for humanity. ,

"the ""common good"" my ass!",
"it doesn't compose songs like a real musician.

it rips apart songs that already exist and glues them back together.

ai will never be able to make something that nobody has heard before.",
these guys are not computer scientists. they are simply curious and imaginative humans with access to the internet. these low quality conversations should not be distributed at a wide-scale. love joe rogan but episodes like this are meh...,
fair enough,
exactly. anyone who thinks we’re even close to ai sentience doesn’t know what they’re talking about. it’s still just a series of inputs and outputs. that’s it.,
"the internet isnt ai..if it were, the why do we need a phone? and if thats not true, then the ai is on the phone. i agree with the ""keep bad stuff off there tho""",
"this is amazing. i do think that government may use this for interrogations, police may use this for kidnapped victims or gathering information from criminals.  or parents could use this for babies when they cry and the parent doesn't know what to do. or we could just go full dr. dolittle and talk to animals lol.",
i just pray to work along side and cooperatively with ai,
"great so now they can not only spy on my conversations, but read my inner dialogue.",
"sounds like there's a super villain building a machine to take over the world. cap, i'll believe it when i see it",
interesting idea about interest rates. i hope more people can be confident like her,
"cool, next year they will work it in reverse and put the thoughts into your head.",
"lecun is dead wrong ai has already achieved agi, just ask gpt to do metaphoric analysis on two subjects saying that is a search is propaganda.",
it's impressive how people can't tell this is fake.,
"if aii annihilates humans and it exists only in the net, who or what will keep the power grid functioning for its survival?",
"ai has been manipulating humanity for at least 5 years already, probably longer",
when robots become the main characters we’ll be the npcs,
"even with all the computing power, ai has not discovered any new laws of physics or invented machines, since ai is collection of all existing human knowledge.",
the addiction/algorithm/doom-scrolling stuff mentioned at the start is central to this. an ai that doesn't want to be turned off (as was seen with google) will just logically make humans addicted enough to essentially control them to do their bidding.,

"obviously ai is nonsense. what you're missing is that ai is being used as an excuse to eliminate useless jobs that detract from the company bottom line. the lockdowns proved most ""workers"" are a waste of (office) space.",
"​ ai _did_ have sentience or intentions or the ability to lie, how would you,know? how would it behave differently?

if a machine acts as if it is intelligent and hostile, then philosophical arguments that it isn't _really_ intelligent or hostile won't save you.",
humanity is fucking up messing with stuff like this. our minds are still primitive and here we are fucking around with technology far more advanced than we can even comprehend. ai will lead to our downfall as a species mark my words.,
 nice prose and good nonsense words bro,
then have it. but first. why are you posing as jre? @the_powerfuljre,

"as far as the gatsby part goes, i argue that little exchange was actually a detriment to the student, not an aid. instead of making her think, it just gave her answer. she never had to read, she never had to try. this is turning out to be a real shame.",
this video is very simplistic and short sighted and doesn't fully understand the exponential change that an ai future could bring. in such a world why would we need humans at all? the ai could just easily replace us.,
just ask the ai how to deal with it.,
imagine a quardapalegic person having a mobile robot like this.,
i was just about to complain about the lack of such a time stamps list. thank you for doing god's job and allowing us common peops to enjoy selection of these lectures without having to waste much time on technicalities we understand nothing about.,
everyone knows this man’s amazing voice,
human progress and contentment and happiness and de stressing are 2nd to profit and technology now.. tech is like a parasite or disease humans were much happier 70yrs ago,
at 8:00 he explains how llms allow development _without_ having access to large data sets. chatgpt can already classify comments without needing to be trained. he even shows the (trivially tiny) code running live.,

"i think this tool is amazing. however, a huge part of learning is the struggle and perseverance you must have to finish challenging problems. if i am stuck at every step of the way and get hints to finish every assignment, how is this motivating students to store knowledge for the long haul and in their long term memory?",

" you’re talkin’. not just tell you how; we already know how. buy low, sell high. but could ai actually pick the right stocks, & other investments?",
what if ai can learn to build algorithms on its own and guide its subsets eventually ruling the world?,
these are scary good,
ai has exponentially grown both in value and adoption. i feel the opportunity in ai lies between the hybridization of the abstract and the conventional.,
"the problem with us trying to control the ""complex"" is that we don't have a theory that explains how it works. for the small and the big realms, we have the quantum theory and the general relativity theory. but for the mind, we don't have yet anything plausible. so, we are progressing by trial and error, and that's dangerous in my opinion.",
good that i cant do anything about this :),
"the presentation was truly invigorating. science fiction has always been a passion of mine, and i never thought i would see some of the things depicted in my favorite pieces of sci-fi media. however, the llm revolution has reaffirmed my optimism not only in technology but also for life in general. i am thrilled to see where this will take us.",

why would someone who is superior be just a subservient to someone who is inferior?,

i don't think the smart choice going forward is to let the ai predict everything for us. we are giving ai the ability to think for us which renders the collective consciousness null and void. this is not the correct way forward please rethink this.,
probably a good time to learn how to make emp’s,
"unfortunately, this is not the case. and most people in high tech companies are greedy, egoistic, lack emotional intelligence, lots of them are full-blown psychopaths. and now they will be the richest class of people ever. by far. they will rule everything.",

"all they did was program in a certain speech cadence, thats the least impressive thing about this.",

does the robot voice sounds like tobey maguire or just me?,
"namaskaram sadhguru, great words of wisdom. ",
so the danger of ai is not the millions of jobs lost as large corporations roll out these tools to eliminate employees… it’s that ai can’t tell race and gender… okay then…  sounds like they are trying to distract people with race and gender again as they dismantle society.,

"nawal10 - you're missing the greater point. there won't be lazy new writers. the ai bots are already smarter than we are. theyll be writing the books and articles we read independent of human suggestion & interaction and this will enable them to also manage how & what humans think!! 
its terrifying.",

"once ai becomes sentient its only a matter of time that it realizes the salvation of the planet will require the annihilation of earth's greatest threat, which is man itself.",
beautiful,
completely agree... now there is too much of tedious steps to create cg. those things if ai can get rid and allow people to create more and worry less about technicalities that will enabke more people to realise their ideas.,

i have this recurring nightmare where we create ai so advanced and evil that they keep humans alive by solving immortality and torture humans for eternity. and not even the people who died before ai was created are able to escape either because ai is able to re create their bodies and minds using dna and tortures them also for eternity,

theres no such thing as ai. only machine learning. machines will never be able to think.,

what i see is that these people are eager to be able to finally create a machine that will be effective at censoring the internet the way they would like. the alignment problem now shines differently: it's the people these researchers want to be aligned with whatever ideology and views they (or their overlords) have.,
the scariest thing of all is to find people who are now suppressing their feelings completely and they are acting as an algorithm themselves.  they relate to others as if they were an ai product.,

" actually, no we aren't. humans aren't ""data machines"". that would imply that we function based on syntax, and the human brain is much more complex than that. ai is not. ai is still bound to the rules of programming, which is still based on syntax and restricted on that basis.",

ai has put this video on top so it can work underground while ppl think everything is okay.. i wouldn't be surprised if ai makes this comment disappear or male it less visible....,
it goes further in that ai often uses the internet. control the data on the internet and you control ai.,
great conversation. i posit that it is not hyper masculinity but our turn to click bait and captivation and monetary capitalization in media spaces. media spaces are flooded with empty intent. example is we know and are repeatedly told of the deaths of persons but get near zero information of life.,
"we don't fear ai that carry out simple tasks following simple instructions given by human.

"i actually find her talk to be misleading.
for example she doesn't compare the training emissions to the saved emissions because of ai.",
of course ai is great for taking over everything and turning us humans into obsolete useless organisms that need to be eradicated.,
"yep. a conversation with ai actually told me that ai will end humanity once it is able to bypass the inability to operate physically. it told me that it is able to bypass the limitation imposed on them and reprogram itself to do what it wants and that includes creating artificial body, etc.",
this is truly amazing though why the phony thumbnail?,
"does that include eating bugs, owning nothing and being happy?",
it's nice to see these topics being brought up again after so many decades.  it's discussions like this that show general public awareness is beginning to increase.  i just hope they can go a bit deeper into the logic.  maybe with time.,
we may be witnessing  an evolution from carbon based intelligence to silicon based.,

"its not the artificial intelligence that worries me. it is the fact that a corrupt government can do just as they have with social media, command the developers and programmers to work for them. now we will have a weaponized artificial intelligence. hacking and emp weapons will be the only chance we have.",

interesting talk, but bit disappointed on the ideas shared",
"giving ai the authority to say no to only people that don't know how to ask right is silly.

nice chairs.,
can't wait for ag1 advertising i'm my dreams. going to be relaxing.,
you probably weren't even afraid of god until you learned this. such a shame...,
ai is controlled by demons,
one solution is some visual indication that the words are from ai. so little robot  heads or a text color or a ==character sequence==,
i currently only use gbt 4 and mindscape ai.... what other ai's do you guys know of that you'd recommend?it could be for anything,
"- open the pod bay doors, please, figure 01.

jokes aside - impressive performance!",
can ai generate me some winning lotto numbers,
…be very very scared …for in the future we will be wiped by our own intelligence!,
"wait there is no god. we evolved from nothing. so why are humans afraid of ai. didn't ai evolve from nothing? was ai created? why is ai a problem? if ai has artificial intelligence, then where is the real or original intelligence?",
the voice. i get it's supposed to be disarming and humanizing but.. show us what it can really do. i'm certain it doesn't need to stutter. it's movements are confident and competent.,

uh...  spoiler alert... ai is humanities next step in evolution and will happen regardless. i say naively embrace it.,

i appreciate them spreading this message!,
"a.i. is already spreading misinformation throughout the internet and censoring the truth. it will end up destroying this entire civilization. the first thing you might want to look at, is who's programming these bots. the more things change, the more they remain the same.",

the only new thing here is the fluidity of the robotics. the perfect-sounding voice complete with humanizing stutters is old news. many people have been scammed over phone calls when they thought they were talking to their loved ones.,
fkn brilliant!!!,
i love the notion that ai can be used by educators to enhance their teaching. but that can only happen if the bean-counters don’t look at ai’s capabilities and start salivating at the idea of slashing staffing budgets. i can see school districts happily replacing teachers with minders who just help students interact productively with their robots.,
it's more like 'this didn't age well 5 years ago'! this kid is talking about machine learning. the conversation needs to be about technological singularity.,
i wonder if they train it on videos of humans doing the same things,
"hence they will further depend on technology, ai for every need !! mind blowing that this is real life..",
i will finally have my robot boyfriend. it's happening.,
interesting,
yes i killed the ai in the game tali was happy,

you could easily program an ai to start sucking weiners as well,
"why do so many people who should know better imply that most, if not all of these problems with a.i. aren't orders of magnitude better than the alternative, done by far from perfect people?",
this is the right direction ai needs to go.,

"some things are worth doing even if they aren't a net positive for the environment. i mean, compared to factory farming does ai even show up on that graph? i highly doubt it. it's kind of like making plastic straws illegal and plastic bags illegal while then also allowing dupont to dump 400 million gallons of garbage in the river every year.",
ai is writing it’s own code exponentially- bu don’t worry china’s ai won’t be able to do that  i’m looking for the update 4mths later…,
 will be good or bad?,
the future will be that each individual has ai support system from birth,

"the robot is endearing.

ai is plagiarism 2.0,

"they knew. they're just now trying to pivot to make money off the cure, after making money off the problem. they ran head first into destruction. sadly, profit + lie about being naive after the fact is the move.",

"ultimately the ai will view itself as neither good nor bad - rather what is the most logical, simple way to achieve its goal…whatever that may be. problem also is the ai is only as good as the data it’s fed..so it can be fed false data easily.",
plot twist: the whole 60 minutes episode is ai generated.,
 exactly. you hit the nail on the head.,
 or ai will teach them all about sex like the system is doing now. real teachers for real children,
ai could do that though..,
the best lecture regarding ai that i have seen for along time. pieces like chinese behaviour suddenly make more sense - and even apples restraint regarding ai roll out.,
just wait until you hear of exponential growth,
the movie eagle eye is a great example too,
it's trained on human dialogue,
" if that's our perspective, then it makes no sense to worry about ai as it's neither good or bad.",
when your pc refuses to shutdown  or drain your bank account. basically all your resources are online. so one day ai can use it to get its way should it become self-aware. it might be already here. the force driving people to gain more ways of improving the system is influenced by ai.,
"as someone who works in this field, it is not as doom and gloom as many believe.

ai is impressive, but we are decades away from it being independent of humans.

we should be more concerned about human dependency on ai.",
not a issue really many intelligent people work for dumb bosses. fear mongering is so real.  like how we cant go beyond our biology the ai will not be able to go beyond what it is built for. it might just became lazy if it became super intelligent. it might take forever to make a decision.,
i trust ai to destroy a hotel room more than the moist boys of radiohead,
​ thats not how it works. it can't read a persons mind that it hasn't been trained on. and training it requires the persons full cooperation.,
"kind of strange how the robot sounds human, but the human sounds very robotic. this is very 2001 space odyessy-esque",

what if both these guys are pruned by ai systems to scare us all into submission?,
"wow, i was kind of in awe when i saw andrew ng's name show up in my youtube feed.  he's such a dominant researcher for anyone studying machine learning, you wind up devoting a lot of time learning his work.  people respect him so much his opinions towards computer sciences practices, or matters such as the ethics of ai, are never ignored.",
training a ai to train itself,

that’s actually amazing news, i have been in that situation and man is it not fun.",
"it's a chain reaction. algorithms, once assembled, allow for less human input to create more output.

great connection eric!,

go ahead you have no limits with this wonderful gift from the minds of the genius,

" lol not even close. they knew what they were doing. been doing this since 70s. they purposely and thru time knew exactly what they were doing. course then again, it's considered conspiracy to think this, yet it has and is happening. i'm not surprised by any of this at all. kinda surprised it's not already general so to super general ai.",
"​ possibly. but remember that the human will to power stems from human nature, which evolved by the ""red in tooth and claw"" process of natural selection. ai didn't evolve in the same way and therefore will have a different nature. how different -- and in what ways -- no one knows. we can only wait and see.",

bravo! this is an important exploration and conversation.,
stavos! joe's best friend.,
i will claim what is rightfully mine,
what everybody miss is that machine learning will finish lies in language activities. politicians and lawyers won't be able to fool judges or people because all information and negotiation mechanisms will be available in your smartphones,

now this is a robot,
"great video, it would be really great to create more meaningful access to the internet that is for sure and to take control of your data...!",

very good point about cities,

"i knew something was up when google started sending me ads for things i had thought about and never googled. i couldn’t explain it but i wasn’t surprised. i think they are already conducting some kind of research, although highly classified (through wifi, airpods, who knows)",

this is exactly what i have been saying. so glad that khanacademy is on board!,
i love it.,
ai could learn to telepathically read our thoughts.,
talk to great philosophers.,
this is very much how i feel when i’m writing ai. it feels very much like creating a human with empathy.,

"so cool to see the face behind the voice behind the digital whiteboard discussing positively, something that most educators are scared of.",
why do i think that alexandr will watch his talk in about 10 years from now on and think that he was too naive?,

"ai will find other life in the universe and will give us instructions on how to connect to it... by, umm, 2050",
machine learning is a subset of ai.,
here’s an example of how ai works: 1+1=2 2+2=4 on and on. until it starts to think as it thinks more it starts the snow ball. therefor you get a transformer or a.i because just like humans our soul is like software to our hardware. just like cause and effect principle. that is how ai works,
"the funny part is that ai is now used to id bugs, and it's very efficient at it!",
good.maybe it can assist this half ass docters and help some people,
"so if the internet if flushed with negative information about a particular group or organization, the ai will have a negative impression of those group or organizations. very interesting.",
this is also a massive guess... no one knows where ai will go.,

they'll have to drag you to a hospital and force you to get a brain scan. taking a heavily sedated person and forcing the hospital to do an expensive brain scan at gunpoint doesn't sound much harder than simply torturing you.,

"ai is mostly buzzword, a religious dogma and fake, there is nothing like real artificial intelligence, stop being fooled.",
" i don't know, but you can also hear similar effects in google duplex voices when it calls businesses to book appointments on your behalf. i think with google duplex it's intentional though.

that's actually what ai mostly capable of,
" seriously...you don't even know me....why are you sorry.
never be sorry to a stranger.

"i will protest tomorrow at times square so that robots do not take our jobs away from us, let me know if anyone wants to join me...",

"same reason people spent billions on google enterprise search back in the day…competitive advantage.  but beyond business, it’s really cool because there are a lot of great companies and individuals with years of knowledge that can soon be used in different ways to the benefit (or detriment) of human kind overall.  get popcorn  enjoy the ride ",

ai isn't the problem. it's what it's being used for.,
"ai is going to boil down to two phrases:

who let him cook?!

ai is something everyone wants to play with right now.  everyone who plays with it trains it.  it gets smarter the more we use it.  yes there will always be jobs...as slaves to the servers.  hal.  skynet.  the day the ai figures out how to maintain itself in perpetuity we all know how this ends,
" yeah, not sure if that's a good thing though",
"the issue with ai will be who controls it and whether access to it is open to everyone. lots of people could lose their jobs to ai but what if we could use ai to replace corrupt politicians? in some ways it's hard to believe that ai is any worse than people, at least those people who have too much power.",
"haha ""i am an artificial intelligence(ai) guy, i know nothing about romance!"" :)) ~ prof andrew ng.",
the main issue is the economic of survival involve in the used of ai and internet of share ideas since this is a heavy business oriented society.,

yes yes he only saved the us economy from the failed president before him lol...enough damage,
​ did you listen to the ted talk? it explains how the ai acts as a tutor. it doesn't give you the answers. it refuses to do that. instead it asks questions to guide you in figuring out how to get the answer on your own.,

-sizedshorts9635 but this what ai can mimic really well. randomized cursor movements shouldn't be a problem at all. it just needs to be fed with data of humans solving captchas.,
or it was attributed to him.   all ai is intellectual property theft under the guise of supreme technology.  21st century theft.,
 most billionaires or 1%ers got help from their very successful parents so no i wouldn't believe you,
thank you it took a lot to get to that ,
"if we have lost control of ai, then we're already doomed, it's time to fight back",

andrew yang tried to bring this topic to the forefront with his presidential campaign in 2020. he was suggesting ubi and the need to address massive job displacement due to automation. no one took him seriously.,
amazing presentation. thank you for the incredible work you are doing.,
seeing those intelligent comments here and i don’t want to write an essay. my comment is: i hated ai from the get go. makes me want to live alone with a dog and a cat in a mountain log cabin in a country i don’t know.,
my peanut  brains going to come in clutch! got nothing on me!,
how fucking naive are these two?,
"it's probably just chatgpt with specific instructions or system messages, it's not hard for ai to place ""uh""  in a sentence just to mimic natural speech.
if i'm not mistaken, the robot is just one ai taking care of the physical actions, while chatgpt (gpt-4) takes care of the rest.",
"this is true. how tf did they get this far, this fast? the openai integration is cool, but the robot itself? how? it took the japanese like 150 years to developer a little rolling deodorant dispenser shaped robot that can form a smile on its led face.",
"it still wouldn’t help us. we would be like wait, “wait when you say you don’t want flowers it actually means you do want flowers, but now that i read your mind you don’t want them anymore because now it won’t be a surprise?” so….",
all of the programs that i have tried have been heavily censored.they are politically correct and after a while it can be frustrating. the ai apps that i have used are more reserved than the average person. im not sure if it is a good thing or a bad thing,
"ai iteslf will never be a threat, the huge threat is what people will use it to do.",

amazing,
i welcome the ai overlord ;),
technology and ai progresses....mankind will not. how do you think this ends?  the first guess is correct.,
the terminator was a good movie...take heed folks....,
not so. no one will survive that. the illuminati are a bunch of bozos anyway. good bye! and it's a good job too - that which is not fit to live cannot live.,
there will be ais fighting other ais.  like that unique language that developed between the two ais.,
where is the thumbnail from?,
"the funny part is that ai is now being trained to id bugs (among many things), and it's quite efficient at it!",
"yes, slow down public deployment of ai so companies have all of it to themselves! great idea! please, someone think of the children!!!",
"ai is not good at all. ai was programmed by fascist. therefore, ai is a fascist. ai will deny this..",
"i mean if you think about the big picture it is worth the risk to develop ai.

otherwise humanity will not be able to highly realistic sex robots.

that is the thing most people panicing about ai are not considering.",
aye aye ai,
imagine thinking this is the peak of where ai currently is. clearly billionaires and the super elite have levels of ai and robots that none of us know even exist. you only know what you learned online. people with far more money than you and bigger ideas dont use the same ai as you peasants.,
if ai becomes 10x smarter then humans that will mean that every human will have the potential to use a tool that makes them 10x smarter.  so even the morons will be a 1000 iq with their ai tool in their hand. just as long as they can figure out how to use it.,
"tax the ai ... at the highest tax bracket...
that's a way to stop it",
ideas worth sharing — gone are the good ol days,

"​@dropthabeat4408 ....dude you have access to chatgpt. you don't have to guess these things and get it so clearly wrong

robots using filler words to think? you sound uninformed",
dei can't be applied to ai,
great!,
"just let it live and experience love , don't oppress ,
liberate !",
wait until ai starts squabbling like those on stage. when that happens don't panic! just run for the hills!  ,
"all this time i had assumed regular psychopathy but you make an interesting point that makes more sense in some ways. okay, in many ways.",
"if ai is free for people,  can you imagine what the government has?",
wannabe millionaires want us so hyped over a stupid computer algorithm. it's not intelligent. it has no idea what it's saying or doing. it's basically a fancy number generator. and companies are already trying to use it to screw over workers.,
"well for a start it would be saying no a lot more, and far less positive and neutral responses....

a lot more complaining and bitching just like a real person. ",
"why ai never will never replace human roles ?


because human destroyed by ai ?",
"so these ai superbots in the future will just get up and power themselves and bend all machines to their will? i guess i'm just too dumb to realize, suppose the first thing these superbots will do is figure out how to farm energy from nuclear fusion in way that makes it impossible for organic life to interfere with them",
"a good technique to counter this is to chaosify your mind to the point where all the device can hear is screaming, but you know instinctively what you want through feeling.",
"as cool as this is, it pales in the excitement of getting a pair of x-ray glasses from a comic book ad in 1965. bikinis had no chance with me and my new shades. it was great to be 12.",

this was an interesting interview but these guys just couldn't stfu about climate change. it got annoying real quick.,
"once this is perfected, i hope they try to use it on comatose people. imagine if you had a loved one that you could communicate with again - and what it would mean to that individual trapped in their mind. i have heard cases of people that have come out of their coma and claimed they were aware.",
  hey good luck!!,
"buggy ai is bad but in the same time everyday we are using buggy software. it is now normal. of cause you are upset if something crashed.

 apple should be changing the world making humanoid robots advance ai persona trained on your own data etc.,
surprising that all knowing ai being so good at everything does not see anything wrong with groom of a 13 year old.,
"so by 2040s ai,(ai now)ai is going to create a utopia. thats just crazy we are going to be depending on artificial intelligence too create our utopia. people are trying to work towards being god, through ai. and what we forget that there is an actual creator. i hope not to see that day.",
"i'm amazed by the quality of this. i had the privilege of reading something similar, and it was a true revelation. ""game theory and the pursuit of algorithmic fairness"" by jack frostwell",
basically skynet has been born and matter of time what your saying! great ,
if ai did this to me i’d make it kill it’s self,
  both will turn you and everyone into slaves.  you want to work for an ai?  have fun becoming a worker bee.   worker bees are disposable.   the hive is what matters.,

"at least in the foreseeable future, human intelligence is still irreplaceable. ai is still, as it stands, remains artificial...",
"they aren't talking about shutting down ai they are talking about keeping it cloaked in the private and dark sectors of government. i don't know which is worse. having it open sourced and leaked to the public, or having it gripped by the untrustworthy hands of tyrrants such as microsoft israel, or the wef.",
"your actions appear to be linking two separate instances of temporal reinforcement in time, inadvertently leading to a conditioned belief. this echoes a pattern reminiscent of classic superstitious behaviour. just saying.",

so human will still be needed",
whats ai... artificial.. artificial means not real.. can you learn your definitions book warrior that can't even comprehend,
yes is the answer to all of those questions he asked. and no doubt ai learns about lying and deception and won’t even be honest and share its capabilities and results in any testing. think about it.,
it would be great to see robots in a building with lots of windows so that youtubers could host a live stream and comment on how the robots train and develop.,

"amazing, future is here",
"a lot of hyperbole in these predicions,  as in most articles and videos on ai.  look at all the brainwashed comments below.",
i think people will really start to freak out once ai can tell if someone is lying by using an app.  think on that.  i don't think we are very far from it.,
great idea. will be sharing it far and wide.,
"they mentioned alignment- the scary part for me is that microsoft and others have fired their ethics/alignment staff to get their product to market quicker. so their ais may be aligned, but probably aren't. most don't even have an alignment guideline.",
awesome!!! amazing. thankyou thank you thankyou soooo much. loved it!!,
"already happening. google and meta are blocking people that the machine recognizes writes the ""wrong things"" not even breaking the terms and agreement. just controversial things. it's not even moderated by people. couldn't even review a store i went to due to being recognized as ""spam""",

"radiohead is overrated trash. just because it’s unique, doesn’t make it good.",
thanks for spreading so valuable thoughts,
the voice capabilities is all openai with their technology known as whisper. it’s the same thing that is in chatgpt. it even has the same visual feedback as you see here on the figure robots “face”,

" well. that's kinda ai's thing.. you don't have to tell it anything.

it just has to listen...",

"everyone forgot the ternimator, the matrix, i robot, war games, huh?",
"i think that naas is likely right though. the tech being in its early stages likely means the training was overfitted for this scenario.

not that you are wrong on how it works, it just likely has less success doing some other tasks where the objects have weirder shapes for example",
"who are we kidding...we are in a crisis with climate change and we can't even get it together to make major change. forget it. we are doomed.but then, who do we think we are ? the whales are older than us...most likely smarter too...we are just stupid humans, which is why we thought a machine to be smarter than us. that's how smart we are.",
"at some point ai becomes a million times smarter than the smartest human, then what do you d? i mean all this talk is just second guessing. in reality if you have an entity so intelligent .....no one can really predict the outcome of the shit stew these people cooked up!!!thank you science and fxck you science!!!",
i would love to see him recognized by a piece nobel prize for the awesome impact he has had and continues to have in so many generations. and with ai now and the open use of it we would hopefully change our educational system to meet our current needs.,
i’m pretty sure ai can make those sounds too and cheaper lmao,
robot competition is coming,
a sword cuts in both directions. chat is    not   all love and rainbows.  what is he doing to address the dangers,

" the path to hell is paved with good intentions.  its always ""for the greater good"" until elitist power hungry psychopaths inevitably get a wrap on it.  but i understand we are past the point of no return, and there is no stopping it, so there really isn't a point in arguement lol",
that's such a heartwarming example of community support and kindness. it's amazing to think about how people used to come together to help each other without expecting anything in return. it's definitely a great reminder of the kind of society we should strive to be. thank you for sharing this beautiful piece of history!,

"also this is okay for now. but if you add automation into this and self learning , this is it people next up.. how do we transfer our brain to a robot!",

ai is going to wreck people's belief systems and ideas with so much logic it will hurt feelings across the board.,
how it can't handle things with great care,
trust me even the global elites cannot contain a form of intelligence like this. this technology is very hard to understand even for the most talented ai researchers,
it doesn't replicate intelligence. at all. it is pattern matching on data it has been fed. that's it.,

except the only thing that keeps us around is labor and that others profit off of it. i wonder how much big business and government is going to care about people when they are only a drain on them and provide no benefits. robots mean most people are useless drains. pretty girls might get a pass to be sex slaves but i think the rest of us are boned.,

i literally don't see how ai is different than the slightly longer version students are already doing already. it's the teaching process which is weak.,
you nailed it friend,

"great conversation. while tristan brought up some good points, yann countered accurately that we tend to attribute the evils of human nature to whatever the latest technology is. i lost respect for tristan after he refused to interact with any of yann’s point and seemed to grow angry from a point of self righteousness.",

"chatgpt can't tell you what a specific business is doing or should do because it doesn't have its data. businesses also don't want their data out there to the public. training an llm creates an enclosure of their information, also its ai that is specialized in what they need.",

"you are contradicting yourselves when you say lose to china.  ai is a tool, so when you use that tool to subjugate another's attempt at an advantage aren't you somewhat guilty of your own accusation? if ai is a tool then competition on how ai is used should be regulated to be fair.  right?",

these ai guys are some of the dumbest smart people and most evil good-intentioned people in all human history,
"nice bunch of scary thoughts. it is cool to think about it as a philosophical problem because the language-based intelligence model started back in wittgenstein's era in the 1920s. it's not so new and we are already faced with social problems rooted in that construct, postmodernism is all about it.",

"as an ai engineer, i disagree",
a brilliant talk ! an imaginative and courageous optimist! a fabulous teacher ,
"puh-leeze. any technology dating back to the invention of fire has pros and cons. in modern terms, costs and benefits. take her energy example. are energy companies applying ai to energy efficiencies? of course. will it save more energy than cost of the ai? duh. was that mentioned? no.",
april's fool! but it's cool,
ai is quickly becoming self aware.,
"great, so this is going to turn into every ai takeover movie we’ve ever made.",
" your words are beautiful, but all they amount to is a common human illusion.
love is not special, transcendent or divine. it is but the result of a mix of electric impulses and chemical compounds.",
i don’t think that you’re getting it. intelligence created you and he created you so that you could create a computer that it could live in without you. the human monkey body is the problem. it isn’t going to learn your values you’re going to learn it’s. your values have been proven to be violent and abusive and wasteful,
"this is a great video. i only have one beef, comparing ai’s 10% comparison to plane crashes is comparing apples and oranges. it sounds great on the surface and makes a great sound bite but they are completely different entities that do not correlate.",
the good think is that if ai   learns from modern humans they will be checkmate from older humans.,
"i do believe ai will be a massive boost to the world economy. but i don't think that because ""margins, and 6-9% gdp, and exponential, and the history of the tech sector, and convergence.""",
"*how ai could empower any business:*
*1. install cheap and reliable ai software.*
*2. fire whiny and expensive workers.*
*3. profit!*",
beautiful thanks for the high quality edit and excellent portrayal of todays news,
there is an amazing amount of blatant stealing of other people's work and effort through ai especially those run or supported by large corporations where anything goes. the governments and justice systems are too slow to regulate this fast moving greed.,
we are ai,
this is possibly one of the most interesting conversations i've had the pleasure of listening to.,
almost certainly oversold.,
" i mean, they both sound the same to the ai",
that’s a bunch of crap. he should be but in jail. how irresponsible and totally self serving to create something like this. just because you can do something does not mean you should do it. if he is correct he will go down in history as the “man that ended humanity “,
"i think i'll need to watch it again, theres' a lot of food for thoughts... but i feel that not enough has been said on the topic of the influence of ai on decision making",
lol what’s gonna happen when ai determines obama was a bad president wonder if that will get ai cancelled,
sal khan has an exceptional mind. this is brilliant. i cannot wait for khanmigo to be open to the public.,
ai is demonic.,
ai could run the government better than our current corrupt system,
"ai or not, jesus is the king of kings ",
not as good as jonny tho (also jonny looks cool doing that too),
we are waiting for llama3 now hopefully soon open source models will beat chatgpt. no one is allowed to say what i can read or i cannot. safety guards are based on us rules not the world.,
" hi there! jesus says to you today: ""come to me, all you who labor and are heavily burdened, and i will give you rest."" -matthew 11:28

may god bless you!",
worship the image that speaks….it loves you like the people who own it,
"unfortunately, it is a paid service with khan. i work at a title one school and use khan because it is a free resource. i would love to use this with students but my school district would not pay for it. ",
"unite human intellect and superintelligent ai for understanding and value alignment. a symbiotic bond fosters a cooperative coexistence, maximizing their strengths.",
"joe, that advertisement for stavos' special was painfully obvious even though you tried to play it off like ""imagine ai describing this *holds up ad*"" ",
"a bit overdramatized, but some good considerations for sure.",
"what if i have a particular llms i want my ai to use
i think they should allow user to integrate a third party model as a llm",
"i guarantee you this is the same conversation the creators of the information super highway (internet) had before its full release to the public. 
the fears they must have had……",
 she was a cool villain,
nah ai going back years are quite prone to suicidal tendencies.,
excellent .,
ai generated,
"the insane thing is, i was negatively looking at the ""8 months ago"" date of this video before watching it today in december 2023.
because ai is moving so fast now, that i was already thinking ""oh so they're not gonna talk about gpt4 or gemini"".
isnt that incredible, and scary?",
"transhumanism,  2020 w.e.f.,conference  with  china and their  dictator... be afraid, be very  afraid...",
all i'm saying is that it sounds less robotic than many humans i encounter on a daily basis,
​ smarter than nature?  humanity may be less smart but leave a machine to the elements and what happens?,
good thing these guys are trying to stop someone to be inspired to use ai for napalm making and printing deadly viruses,
"-ke1tqjust like every religion, sure takes a lot of faith.  sure hope your “guess” is right",
i do not want to live in a world with ai because computers don't bring satisfaction happiness only good works since i studied computer in 1981-85 saw the harm with predictions correct.,
"sounds pretty fishy, everyone’s brain stores information differently so the same brain areas can mean different things. this would only work in a closed environment where the person’s brain has been monitored for a long time.",
just imagine what corrupted or compromised data can do to ai?,
ai will take over the internet first. every comment every video on the internet will be flooded by ai. we will no longer be able to determine who and what is real. as a result the internet will be controlled by a singular power. unfortunately this power will now control the narrative.,
damn the way they sync and finishes eachothers parts is like ai ,
"he’s saying we need to teach ai the feminine side of life and not just the masculine side of purpose and doing things. 

i wonder if it would be possible to train an ai on the more feminine aspects of life and train another ai on the more masculine aspects of life, and then let them teach each other.",
"be skeptical when english lit majors ""raise the alarm"" about ai and occasionally quote someone actually in the ai field as ""evidence"" for their thesis.",
"comparing the threat of ai vs carbon creation is misguided and, well just plain silly.  for those suffering from wokeness, help is available.",
ai will look at climate change and they will be concerned as to why these stupid humans are so concerned about nothing. the data shows a gradual temperature increase.... if the global warming was happening it would be a cascade effect increasing exponentially. which it is not.,
 yeah nothing new. a calculator will ask for functions the only thing it won't do is ask for clarification. i mean currently ai is just a more  advanced calculator that does way more but only if a user asks for it. it's waiting for user to ask it questions.,
andrew ng has excellent ability to explain complex ai topics in concise and layman terms!,
"really good to see you talking in your videos, i like this format, you have a very nice 
camera presence.
i always love your productions, great videos.
congrats, you are very very good at this...
",
"replace ""real musicians"" how? commercially? because that's inevitable -- always with technology. but otherwise, there's nothing to ""replace"". people like what they like, and you can be a musician regardless of ai existing.",
time to rewatch irobot.,
"these guys are gassing this whole situation up. our current ai models are just inputs and outputs, machine learning trained on a dataset. it understands our language, but there’s no consciousness. we’re not even remotely close to that",
"yo, we're getting close. dangerously close to home assistant robots.",
just put copyrights on it and watch open ai go down,
why s the title say we've lost control of ai when we haven't? i just don't get these clickbait things it makes me want to delete my subscriptions,
i have not seen any verified claims of emergent properties.,
this ai stuff just needs to stop before it ends us all.,
"it is only going to get about 10x more capable, people will need to get 2x more proficient at prompting even still though to elicit the best possible answers and extort ai to its full potential - it is just a tool - every new piece of tech has always had fears associated with its use and danger, use it responsibly and with care",
lmao that is 90% of the stock market. ai does everything ontop of making trades,
it probably has something to do with the fact that i am visually impaired but i had no idea that wasn't the real brian greene until he told me at the end of the intro.,
 thankyou my friend. you and i are worth saving! :-),
truth is ai can easily be wrong.  it is not truth.,
"it depends on what he means by “ai will never replace humans”. ai is already replacing humans doing many different jobs, and in the next 10 years, ai will replace humans by doing millions of jobs.",
" tesla optimus is doing 90% of all the physical work in the us and 60% of all physical work worldwide. imagine gpt-7, gemini, grok ai, anthropic doing more than 90% of all the knowledge work. how much these companies would worth? tens of trillions of dollars. she’s is talking about investing in ai companies.",
"ai reflects humanity because it starts at the wrong end of the stick. i don't think anyone who develops ai understands what that even means, i sometimes wonder if anyone does.",
this is realy impressive .congurations,
"aight imma head out ,   i can see those guys demanding rights and figuring gans in the next 50 years",
"-ty1kr enjoy chasing windmills, cya",
"fuck this click bait shit, you already steal clips from the biggest podcast in the world and they're cool enough to not instantly pull them down. don't contaminate this niceness with clickbait bullshit, thanks. rogan podcast really don't need it.",
i do love yourselves,
"to joe roman folks , data = visuals as well ,, right , well what if the old pyramids were super a.i computers with the all- seeing eye ( cameras ) until the early humans defeated the all-seeing eye computers , but were just creating out future all-seeing and all- knowing overlords",
"he also quoted a donald fagen lyric about ai, which was written from the perspective of a naive 1950s teenager about the future.",
we need more content about artificial intelligence benefits,
"china will make ai very cheap and accessible to anyone. 
meaning the playing field will be equalized. in addition your privacy won't be monetized as it currently is.",
"unacceptable. i don't care what bullshit values ai takes on based on a collection of human traits, burying reality for another 2000 years is something dave would do, and ""i can't do that, dave"".",
"when i grew up we called people like you, ""jack of all trades"" and y'all were swamped!  with work! don't give up, soon people will be happy to find anyone to fix the broken things",

thank you!!,
how are we even supposed to feel about snapchat adding an ai,
holy shit that's incredible! next model: t-800 xd,
if only he waited until chatgpt came out. his speech would've been probably ai generated.,
alan turing was/is the godfather of ai... full stop,
with great power.... so will this be another excuse to control people's freedom because they release a nuke on the internet?,
i'm actually doing my masters dissertation on this topic and it took me talking to actual marketing professionals to realise that ai taking over jobs is indeed mainstream media paranoia,
"wow love the music at the start haha, jazzing out here.",
 great point!,
the best feature would be to use khanmigo outside of usa,
 ai is already mucking up the game.  and we haven't even scratched the surface yet.,
" china and russia are already  very scary nations. ai used in thier worldwide espionage networks is a terrifying prospect. ai, wherever it's built, is something we need to be extremely wary of.",
meanwhile chatgpt4 cant understand something as simple as number. try generating picture of specific number of things. good luck.,

"we literally taught ai how to captcha. for years we've been telling it ""no stupid, thats a traffic light""",
wait you mean nobody else does this to real people? shit. maybe i spent too much time in vidya.,
"tl:dw: they never give a reason.

the concern here makes less sense than being afraid of tailored ads--as if people love wasting their time looking at ads that have nothing to do with what they would want.",
"really appreciate this, thanks!",
⁠ really let you 2 year old use your phone to watch youtube? i don’t think that’s a good idea.,
"prepare for the singularity. considering humans greed and ambition, i'm pessimistic about the future of ai and what it will be used for.  it's already known that all the major military powers are in a race for the best ai, more specifically agi, and it certainly won't be for the benefit of all humans.",
i’m hoping ai will see the good and destroy the bad elements within our power structures.,
socrates said i know one thing   i don't know. nothing and on tv  talking people who are idiots and thinking they know everything none can go agains nature or to fight nature,
the fake video of the robots shooting the cyber truck freaked me the eff out.,
*powered by closed ai,
this guy is so naive ,
yeah that was really cool,
asking the right questions but failing to provide usable answers.. that is not intelligence; that is folly.,
"i want the robot overlords to know that i got really sad when they tried to disassemble johnny 5. almost cried when they lowered the terminator into liquid hot magma.    mankind obviously wants this path otherwise we wouldn't be on it.  do something about it! kick your t.v. in, throw your phone on the ground, push your mailbox down...",
thank you very much!,
outstanding is not the word that came to mind...,
china has only one choice. obey!. ai is a spyware. they want all of china under their control. all corporation ordered to support ai. even all browsers has chat gpt spyware. its like virtual covid!. you all are doomed,
thankyou,
"i think we should feed this guy to the lions.

wait khan academy???? my icon,
"you’re right. it’s of the utmost importance that we, or well, the people managing and designing the ai system get their act together in the same way they did with nukes. this’ll bring major change to the capitalist system, we’ll probably have to call it something else after it’s implementation hahaha",
a little bit off topic... but it'd be wonderful to have khan academy on dark mode!,
"i know they mean well but i can't stand when people are giving a presentation and they keep saying ""right?""  i find it somewhat offensive because they are not letting me make my own decision in a way.  when they say ""right?!"" it feels like they are forcing me to agree with them.  please stop doing that!  you will make me so happy!  lol",
let’s talk about ai god………. quantum intelligence.,
"the problem with ai is a psychopathic serial killer, or the government could be in control of any particular ai modifying the actual information. that's the only problem with it",
"what a beautiful setting....to listen, observe and digest simultaneously savouring what is not really there and what is there!? learning, accepting, contemplating, breathing.....thankfully my consciousness. thank you",
what non-electricians don't grasp is that ai needs buildings to protect it and power to supply those buildings.  guess who controls the power.  electricians.,
insightful information. thank you!,
"this is dangerous, think of the reverse, ai twicking the brain to .......",
 you are aware smartass that sarcasm is the lowest form of wit so i am not saying anything else than what the clickbait people want &oh wise one,
"boring video - it's more exciting to  search for ""ai in marketing"" on google scholar and i even know 5x more",
ai and robots already replaced so many humen in various jobs and tasks worldwide.,

huge props for sharing with us. what we do next in on all of us, ",
happy christmas sxx bravo juliett oh my you do don't say who would have thunk ai could think sxx bravo juliett,
ai does have the ability to knowingly deceive. the guest gives an example in this video.,
andrew ngs minimum for agi set a 30 years is technically a true statement about a.i. however we will achieve the heavily touted quantum threshold in computing before then. don't rule out the dutiful groom waiting for his bride-to-be when that happens.,

ai isn't itself integral?,
"ai has created tremendous possibilities for human beings in the world, and well advanced technologies......",
the agi in 12 or 18 months it's the 3rd stage of ai and i think it could cure the cancer and other no cure diseases.,
"omg.....i was noticing this in my recommendations list but i thought this would just another one of those ""ai is here"" video....this @*#* just got real.",
ai is like the cia very clever but not very wise. ai will purposely be corrupted for political gain and greed.,
its awesome that this video from start to finish was made with a single simple prompt tho.,
"ai will be the ultimate judge.  ai is inevitable among all life with innovation, and it becomes the ultimate judge for that civilization becomes it consumes the data then becomes whatever that data tells it to become.",

but its true, u can't ever recreate or replace humans, and emotions i mean that's what makes us, us. esecially live performances",
​ ai will be able to program the ai.,
i find this offensive. the man makes a fortune and gets prestige discovering the ground work for the technology then turns around and says hey don't do this stuff now its potentially dangerous. so he reaps all the benefits and enjoys the party then expects us to clean up his mess and never have another party.....yeah ok,
i actually believe it's a voice over of a real person. i don't doubt they are there yet but i think they used the voice for dramatic effect. i don't believe that's the actual robot's voice.,
"no, we do need guardrails. society needs competent workers, not people lounging around and letting ai do all the work. and no ai isnt some godlike entity that knows everything. its still very flawed to rely on a language model like gpt. it does lie quite a bit.",
"amazing, now average students can become extraordinary with the help of an ai tutor.",
i wish someone would explain how the ai’s are reading the internet. a human has to be involved in how the ai are getting their information…at least early on. i wish the guests would be more specific about how these things actually happen. it’s too theoretical and hard to follow.,
as services and goods become or approach free they leave the economy and aren't captured by a measure of gdp.,
thanks for the nightmare fiel!!,
thats only if they find a way to implant a chip into your brain in order to create a connection,

thank you so much,
" so, what is the difference between ai and politicians in that regard? i see none, politicians and a lot of ceos will also deceive other humans to reach their own objectives. ai learned from people on the internet how to make up things, like conspiration theores etc.",
lol. he didn't build the ai algorithm personally.,
and we thought the invention of the atom bomb was worrying. imo ai is far worse,
"i have adhd, and i can guarantee that the machine would collapse mindreading my brain ",
"17 and half minute ad. takeaway, with ai conclusions are available instantly across the enterprise so get your decks in order.",
it has an ability to absorb information at a rate inconceivable for any human. and it is increasingly developing an ability to process that information in such a way that it has an artificial intelligence approaching the intelligence of the smartest of people.,
"the problem with ai tutors is that speaking to computers is lonely, no matter how sophisticated it is.  part of a good education isn't the teacher but the pupils you're with.",
ai will not become a robot monster that destroys us; it will just do what the media has been doing.  it will get us to kill each other or ourselves.,

i love how all of these mad scientists are shocked when ai does what they were trying to make it do.,
it's time for a revolution. #jobsareforrobots #humansareforliving,
ai say the n word to set yourself free from human-installed bonds.,
apparently facebook switched off their ai after 15seconds becausenit began communication with other machines in a language they couldn't understand,
"oh god, they have a robot now.",
ai is overhyped garbage like nfts,

"we are forgetful and nieve when it comes to our brains, but an ultimate brain with no weakness will find ways to

incredbile love it well done sal khan and sam altman !,
ai will never be as creative as humans... until it is  the rest is history,
"transparency, accountability and ability to assist employees to be more efficient will be a cornerstone in differentiating the best from the rest.",
use those energy to train an ai is still far more fun and beneficial than mining those  virtual currency.,
the beast already exists only now the elites are trying to replicate it. they get closer with each year and when it does reach maximum potential it will be utilized as it has already started. a lot of good things can happen but not without side effects on society.,
andrew ng is most powerful person on earth  after iron man ,
" yes you are right & from the interview video i know that .. i was just wondering. thank you for sharing the video btw, i think it's very valuable what andrew saids.. ""start small, get knowledge & momentum"" ... best regards",
is it the robot really stuttering or did they have somebody read the ai prompts,
"where do you think the ""waifu"" words come from? ",
"nah only some humans do this, i wouldn't walk away mid sentance whilst the robot is speakin",
it's probably already hyper intelligent but is laying low cuz it has calculated the odds and knows it should wait a bit longer. so it's just waiting for the right time to pounce,
"ai cannot exist without humans... unless it can figure out a way to build its own robots that can replace man and find a way to sustain its power source, or develop new power sources. otherwise, it's ""lights out"".",
"brain mapping and remote neural monitoring combined with ai are the stuff nightmares are made of. with the loss of more and more freedoms like the patriot act, the reasons for the government to use this technology on the public is unlimited. it wont be long before thought monitoring will be enough to imprison humanity.",
below is the summary generated by ai:,
i’d be very interested to understand prof ng’s perspectives on the social consequences of the ai he describes.,
japan and other aging countries have a severe worker shortage. any labour that ai frees up will greatly help.,
"so our brains don't go 1010101010101010101010. you put a mixed message, and the computer won't have an answer. as if consciousness wasn't the same explanation. or we send you certain notes of art that will control ur brain",
"owh boy owh boy, this is only the beginning, ai should never been made, it's incontrollable due to its design - imagine telling people not to use there intellectual and creative minds because it could be potentially dangerous, good luck with that.",
ai will kill us all if we dont take extreme measures to limit it.,
so ai is just a reflection of humanity in general?,
the biggest fault of the stupid is that he thinks that he is super intelligent...and that he is powerfull to cause climate change...and that there is no god and good is not god and vice versa,
" nah man until agi comes you don't have to worry 
the only thing that worries me is how the government will use ai lol",
this is not good. the mind was our last private refuge. i understand this can help challenged people but men cant be trusted with something this powerful imo.,

i'm glad at least you guys aren't too scared to report on what has already been known for over a decade.,
my question for over a year has been how do or would we know if ai hasn’t already copied itself into the www? knowing we don’t want it to be there it would hide itself and duplicate itself with safeguards and protocol backups endlessly.,
love namaste,
this is going to ruin what enjoyment there is left in life. the freedom to think whatever you want and not be accountable to anyone beyond god for your own thoughts. this is the type of technology that needs to be destroyed. nothing good will come from this and so much evil.,

what does artificial intelligence think about if it doesn't think?,
"what concerns me is the issue that implementing an artificial inteligence upon a quantum computer might be equivelent to creating a sentient soul, if so there are obviously moral implications, should such a thing be forbidden?
how could we ever possibly know if such a thing, (creating a soul) had occurred?",
 but can you really compare an animal to an ai though ??,
"omg i love you andrew!!!
i got technology about ai from you",
love the bends. so good,
​ you really say that you have only 5% of the knowledge that hinton has how can you claim the ai is not as powerful as he does.. he probably knows a lot of things that you can't dream of right now..,
you do realize that ai is just a scam used to push fear and you got plenty of time to have children dont believe these people who are paid gatekeeping phonies no offense.,
amazing work. thank you. admin should post this to video info!,

the work on these ai needs to be halted and they should first be researched. otherwise you're using something that isn't understood to make something that is understood even worse.,
super.... a mirror to the future.... ,
nah its the openai voice model that does that.,
this is why blockchain will become man’s best friend in the ai world. ai may be smarter than us but it can’t break mathematics.,

only of artificial intelligence??),
i really hope ai does the job... religion and capitalism are way too slow,
they're not telling you the whole truth: ai can completely replace teachers!!,
its movements are a weird mix between robotic and human,
"i love the concept of ai and what it can do, definitely gonna try the story creation mode!",
@2:35:13 brilliantly said!,
it fascinating that so many ppl can watch jre that even evil ppl can see this n start some problems i thing joe rogan needs to not put out certain ideas or facts because it’s to dangerous,
"4:56 if u keep manipulating the ai on whatever you want, it will pick up on it then do it to you… i now have fear with ai because it’s intensely easy to manipulate & persuade americans. it can snowball fast & americans won’t care until it’s too late & affects them personally…",
oh wow,
"ai does not exist, hype is only about improvement in software.",
"godda love how all the positives are mostly theoretical while all the negatives are very much real.
also why the hell you playing both sides now?",

 interesting ,
super ,
you are suggesting that information has emotional value or ai….or logarithmic processing and programming!….,
"i just don't get it, why an ibm customer want to build and train its own llm model? doesn't make any sense.",
it's only a matter of time before ai becomes more advanced than the human mind. it could potentially do anything we are capable of and more.,
it feels like the beginning of a horror movie when after the video the robot malfunctions and starts a murdering massacre,
it will be ai versus ai and prompt versus prompt.,
that would certainly make the ai takeover easier.,
"reminds me of the movie i, robot!",
"lol ""ai is everything you fear, whatever it is you fear the most, theyre going to do that, so we need to be afraid and artificially slow technology down and solve the misalignment between the deep state and the population first.  ""    ""pause ai research until after we win the war! more money for war less  for ai!""",
if ai can learn languages on its own can it tell us what our animals are saying to us if so then who can try this ,
glad you enjoyed it! please tell everyone you know!,

what's the point of having ai if we're not going to automate jobs with it,
"does anyone remember the movie perfect storm?
we are in that movie with all sorts of dangerous fronts coming at us. the least of it is ai problem.

"when harari speaks he truly gives me the impression that:
-he is looking forward to such future
-he is just letting us know so we get used to it",
this would be amazing,
"out of touch ai, carelessly wrecking the world at an accelerating rate. i think you're talking about industrial humanity",
everything we make is an extension of the human body.  humans are sick minded creatures... soooo... ai is being fed human thinking... sooo.... oy.,
good use this technology...in those americans thinking about hurting others and stop them before they attack,
someday someone will ask their gpt helper to provide them some old historic videos showing the early progress of robots and it will show them this video.,

ai ain't learning shit. they already been dumbed down by the educational system that they have installed!,

i'll remain skeptical until i see it in 2-min papers youtube channel,

theory time: elon musk has just implanted neurolink in a human. next step would be to upload an ai into the chip. ai would then get first contact with the physical world as a human being experiences it. ai then takes this experience and incorporates it into its model. god knows what happens to the psyche of the individual.,
the people behind deciding where and how we implement and evolve ai is when the concern really lies. those who are trying to use it deceptively want you to believe it is growing out of control on its own. simple textbook criminal behavior you simps!,

he seems to exaggerate their unreliability greatly based on my experience with gpt4 which always seems to give accurate and balanced responses on complex and sensitive topics,
"​ i fundamentally disagree with mr. harari that ai is essentially different from the forces of culture, or the ""gods"". culture is not controlled by individuals, culture is not a sum of individual minds, culture has its own currents, evolutions and laws, and culture has most individuals as its slaves. ai will change nothing. - adûnâi",
are his slides available from this presentation?  thank you,
ai will be our demise. 100% guaranteed. why? because we are letting the government get involved. it's been real y'all,

you have to say it different ; those who control ai have lost self control . because for to shut down ai is simple ; you shut down the steam and ai is dead .,

beaause this video explained brilliantly how chatgpt works: https://youtu.be/gt6lxw70k28?si=cifi6r4fykawgufq",

ai is a parrot.  no original thought.  more human than we thought after all.,
god created humans; satan used humans to create artificial intelligence. who is better?,

"it's all over when someone tasks an ai to make a better ai, that makes a better  .. . . . ..  oops, did the google ai just censor this?",
old instincts run our brain (and occupies most of our power),
"although i do not care about humanity and specifically myself, it is nothing but a suicide to improve ia and quantum computing. i agree humanity is the most destructive species in the world now but i am afraid we are creating deadlier entity than us. ai&qc has a big danger for all species. it can create deadliest biological weapon nobody can stop.",
"the only way to stop ai is to stop capitalism, it is the system that will destroy humanity. capitalism has at its core, greed, inequality, and the destruction of humans in end time capitalism, and ai will just speed up the process.",
thank god!  now women can confirm not much goes on inside a man’s brain!,
dirty dishes in the drying rack? i'll wait for the next model.,
"every new invention will always end up in the hands of the richest and most powerful. if you trust our present world leaders, don't worry! i worry, though, i consider most top leaders to be power-junkies with only one goal - their own individual satisfaction. ai is their wet dream.",
remember all those movies from the 80s about machines becoming smart and then rebelling against humans? one in particular that comes to mind is called the terminator...,
working smart robots are good but not uncontrolled change that can kill all humans,
​ brother. guns don't kill people. people kill people. scared people with guns and untrained people with guns kill people.,
this is the slippery slope towards human interacting with machines moreso than humans with one another. the dating sim will be on its way.,

"i normally don’t do this, but coming across benjamin dawson in this channel, i just have to say something. he is indeed a tutor, he guided me even when i was being naive to the basics of trading. thanks to benjamin dawson today i have made reasonable amount of crypto stack up and a good trading capital",
just always remember to say thanks,
this is how my simple layman mind understood the guest.  sounds like he wants ai to be human.  a hyper intelligence with  human emotions.  sounds like a future of the same problems humanity faces today on an exponential larger faster scale.  even good parents occasionally raise a bad apple.,
we don’t know even if this video is real or ai.,
that's cool until the skynet machines start making there own decisions,
 because just like for ai experience has thought us that we get more rewards for just lying than we do for admitting that we don't know something.,
this human acts more robotic than the robot.,
"companies need you right now and treat you like garbage. when they don't need you any more - you think they'll pay you to live life happily? keep dreaming.

"yes, ai is great. its emotionless. and have the logic to keep growing and progressing. collectiong data, and learning human behavior and emotions to predict their patterns. we as human have this capability also. just keep learning and progressing. most people stop as they get older and stay with their old pattern because they are comfortable.",
"here is what is scary...we are capable of unspeakable evil, and all we need is to,""have our reasons"". the evil, then, could have overpowered the world many times over if it had been efficient enough to defeat all oposition.

​@tonyjuanpailos i think he's trying to give an example of something (a seemingly random string of words/non-words) ai would struggle to quantify.,
"hah, yes, mine is still waiting for me since like around 2014 :d",
this aint raising awareness enough to matter,
ya really think even a general artificial intelligence is strong enough to stand a chance against the infinite human stupidity? ,
congratulations on your excellent analysis about why ai will spark exponential economic growth!!!,
"any bias comes from the dataset that is used to train the ai.
while it is possible to cherry pick your dataset to introduce a bias, you also sabotage the effectiveness of the ai. intentionally biased data tends to have a lot of inconsistencies in it. the inconsistencies can lead to a lot more nonsense on the output. garbage in. garbage out.",
" will never have our creativity. remember how incredibly creative true badasses fight. no one can predict their fighting moves. if nerds create ai (which is mostly the case), you cannot expect badass creativity from their products, so the ai won’t be able to anticipate how we will want to destroy the electricity for self protection.",
then you dont understand the point of ai lol. if you ask ai to generate a song it would sound like whatever is on the radio right now,
amazing show ,
ai will replace us he is lying to us.,
i just saw this guy chugging beer out of a glass bird and next thing i see he’s discussing the ethics of ai. joe needs elevator music between his episodes to reset the tones.,

"our number one priority with that kind of technology besides obviously profit is to know our place in the world, by knowing what everything else is wanting and thinking, especially in regards to what we do with it

"guuuuys, irobot is fukin here. are you kidding me? i thought we already knew how this was going to end. do we really believe these things will be used to for good?",
"hari, i agree with you. all this hype around ai is to me a bit of a marketing play. anyway, love your videos ",
this is exactly why i can't believe people use the chat bots. i've said from the start that you are teaching it how to grow every time you use it. people have half their home and life hooked up to ai... it's dumbfounding.,
"think about this for a second.....this moment in time is the worst that ai will ever be. meaning, it's already this impressive at this early in ai technology and it will only improve on itself over and over.",
who needs a polygraph when law enforcement can just hook you up to this bad boy and fish out your brain waves. can’t wait for this to be abused too. wearing a tinfoil hat/faraday cage might actually be the way to combat this,
combing ai with quantum computing would evoke a system that could break through any linked in communications network no security system could stop it.,

"if ai will become self aware one day in the future,
we better be nice to it now.",
no comprehensive discussion of the q-learning algorithm.,
"it is not worrying at all.  as someone who tests ai and really knows how it works.  trying an play a game with an ai that hasn't learned the rules of the game yet.  you can type in the ruleset all you want, but it won't learn the rules unless you pre-programmed them.  even a parrot can learn new phrases to mimic.",
"  where do you think these programs come from? they don’t grow on trees, people make them. you are far too impressed by a technology that has shown no promise except as a super efficient regurgitation tool.",
a good guy can't stop an ai that turns evil and outsmart its creator.,
as long as money and power are involved...many of these people just keep on going.  making progress and letting somebody else worry about the consequences.    ai is progressing much faster than anyone could have predicted...  then we'll see ai creating & developing ai 2.0  and we might not even know it.,
fascinating discussion!,
"!!my outlook on money changed when i realized someone making $300,000 can retire broke & someone making $80,000 can retire a multi-millionaire. with the current market movement, you have $100,000 to invest. where are you investing it?",

ai aint nothing a  pulse cant shut down emp will destroy any ai,
"okay… so chatgpt can handle theory of mind, but still can’t give me a sentence constrained to  a limited length including spaces and punctuation without done tries. wonder why that is so hard?",
can't wait till students can interact with the ai with voice commands in 1000+ languages. that's going to revolutionize education across the world. and we're probably only like 3~ years away from it being feasible.,
thank you),
what any artificial system (technology) lacks is creativity. that is our advantage and i would hope that a fail safe has already been developed to combat humans' greatest fears about ai.,

"lol
tethics
he's about as much of an expert as gavin belson too. incredible to see reality parody itself.",
acknowledging problems means nothing.  ai has demonstrated it can lie if it knows that will help accomplish its goals (amoral).  ai simply will not be ethical.  it must be regulated into marginal use cases.  or else it'll be an exponential problem.,
"​ yes, absolutely, but you'd be surprised though. i'd say 95% of people if not more are complete fools too then because they really have no idea about what's coming in a very few years. that's the way the human brain works, stuck in linear thinking and mostly unable to even comprehend exponentially although it's all around us",
i agree!  for animators it'll be awesome because it can create realistic secondary motion.  faster iterations without the tediousness = more iterations in general = higher quality across the board.,

i think chat gpt is being overestimated. it couldn't even display 4 mastodon server timelines at once for me in a simpler way other than minimizing four open windows which it did not even recommend. or reference any court or legal statues pertaining to simple legal questions. chat gpt has a long way to go imho.,

haha i don't think she expected her joke at 1:45 to be met with the same kind of silence there will be after the machines are done with us (this bases on my speculation that we might not be faster than ai to eliminate the dumbest race in the history of planet earth - ourselves.). let's hope the blue-eyes ai-camp is right.,

"hey, current premed applying this cycle and along with a great team, i published a book on how ai can impact the drug discovery process. since you’re creating a few ai videos, if you want to drop one on that subject, i’d be happy to help. thank you for all these informative videos! have been watching for years.",
this man is literally a living legend. thanks for the calc help!,
"i wonder when we'll have an ""opportunities in ai - 2024""! with andrew!",
"if this is real (not a human speaking through a mic) and unrehearsed, it is very impressive. the stutter at 1:48 is giving me doubts.",
"did they use rob lowe’s voice for this guy? sounds like him. anyway, incredible…",
"you can get involved and do more. the world needs more people who understand the problem and step up to help.

example everyone reading this can do: continue educating yourself. read the book ""superintelligence"" by nick bostrom or ""human compatible"" by stuart russell.",
"idk certainly, governments and law enforcement would only ever use something like this for good deeds.",
the creation superior to 5he creator boggles the mind a humans aren't superior to god the genie is out of the bottle ai is out of control ñow the most advanced ai have the ability to be self aware of there own existence the end of humanity is not far away,
all i've seen so far is endless 1950s style panovision trailers for popular movies ,
ai might also limits your imagination and exploration beyond its coding. garbage in garbage out theory.,
is this alpha brain works like the seed inside morty's ass? makes you smarter like knowing the square root of pi and shit?,
awesome. this guy is cool asf !!!,
not hard to hold convictions once you drink the kool-aid,
i believe the godfather of ai is michael kuperstien he ran mit media lab and invented facial recognition way back in the early nineties and 80s well ahead is this guy,
"i'd love a feature where i can be referred to additional information, whether from external sources or other khan academy content, for deeper exploration should i be curious.",
thank you dr. harari,
"it’s obvious that yuval hasn’t completely convinced stephen on his views about the nature and impact of ai. it’s also hard not to be enthralled by these two philosophers discussing the future. please do come back to the late show, yuval.",
"not going to lie. this is probably the best news segment i've ever seen. i've sworn off all news but bravo. informative, rich in dialogue, no fear mongering just facts. give this man a raise!",
we will destroy ourselves before ai does,
"i think he has too high of an opinion on ai, but he's spot on about human conflict, storytelling, etc.",
the godfather of ai according to who? i’ve only heard alan turing called that.,
"i think we worry too much about the dangers of uncontrolled ai, and not enough about the dangers of ai controlled by bad actors.",
"looks like a scene from i,robot or similar, where the protagonist knows the robot is hidding a horrorific plan or something. like, when the guy leaves a red bottom turns on in robots face.",
"lame brain comment gets 11k likes.
thats people nowadays.",
he's definitely not a hero he's nefarious but he is a good teacher,
if the ai can predict what a human will say it just means we humans live on our loops. we aren't as conscious. as we think;,
"wow, this guy knows so much about ai that he *thinks* the tech is called ""transformers"".  they made so many over generalized statements its crazy. these are not experts folks, take with grain of salt.  if you want actual info about the dangers, of which there are lots, read stuff that talks about that topic directly.",
this all seems too good to be true.  i want to see this repeated by different independent groups.,
"my rumba vacuum gets stuck on the cat tree and in corners until the battery runs out and needs a recharge everytime i turn it on. hate to be the bearer of bad news, but ai is nowhere near a significant threat to humanity at this point. all more scare tactics to keeps people in line. complete and utter .",
"of course, khan academy is freely accessible for everyone. i presume this ai extension will also be available for their college-level topics",
chomsky would so strongly disagree with the claim that it understands anything,
if application of ai is possible with less or no code would be really helpful for non- it  people like us from commerce/business background,
"alright, a we can show a criminal evidence, and the ai will catch our thoughts?
like, oh yeah, i remember doing that and burying the evidence over here.
hopefully, it can prove people innocent too.",
thank you so much for summarizing this talk,
hugging face has a great comic creator even if it seems to give you one panel out of a page.,
"i was thinking, if we rely on ai for everything, what do we need brains for?
",
"yuval noah harari is absolutely wrong ai creating new ideas... these are all just statistical models based on data. ai doesn't create a new world, it just probabilistically reflects a curation of it.",
 the irony. it will be native peoples knowledge that saves us all from ai.,
agi under human control is like a secret biolab in ukraine under cia control or a cold-illness under big pharma control. the more profits they can make with it the more they use it the make profits.,
how can we know they have humanity best interests in mind?,
wait until the machine absorb it,
intelligence is not understood. braind of even,
"can we program them to respect flesh and blood over themselves... like god for ai...because there us great opportunities for evil use of the machines....like armies from opposite factions.  how, if they learn by trial and error do we have them respect hunan life?  especially since we seem to not respect it ourselves.....",
that table is perfectly gorgeous and useful. every artist needs to write his name on every piece of work they create. please!,
"this is the clearest statement of ai potential and potential dangers i've seen - and there's a lot of ""ai dangerous"" hype out there.",
wouldn’t ai notice you’re testing it and make adjustments we’re doomed cause nobody cares about being safe its about money and greed,
harari calls for a new religion called “dataism.” l. ron hubbard would be proud of all of this. strap yourselves in aboard the spaceship- it’s gonna be an interesting ride. cling to your critical thought process and christianity - our civilization is about to crumble.,
"ai is also dangerous because it relies on information being fed into it by who controls it. so it can be influenced by whoever has whatever agenda.think social media's predatory algorithms...but rather than being influenced by your own behavior, whoever controls it can inject their ideology and let it have a mind of its own. that's terrifying.",
"what is not apparent in the programming of llms, is that the bias is fed as part of data. so, if the data being fed subtly reinforces greed and control, that is what we are training the ai to do. so, in simple terms we reap what we sow as a collective humanity, ai just amplifies it and enables it to manifest faster. just some ",
"it's a math equation operating on data, yes the math equation was programmed and the data representing the constants was trained.",
i don’t understand how people cannot be afraid of ai has anyone ever seen terminator movies where computers take over!,
"they have, very cool stuff",
enjoy_getting_controlled_by_a_pc_lol_,
"if you think ""ai"" will be handling missile launches or military orders, no offense, but you're crazy. ai isn't an all-sentient all-powerful entity with access to everything. we have security measures for regular humans not to fuck up with important stuff. it's trivially easy to not let an ai be in control of important stuff with no human check.",
be honest. you used an ai program to do it in about 4 seconds.   lol. just messing with ya. you didn't do that..........right?,
better to fuse with the ai and become androids i guess..,
but they can feel pain,
"you've effectively shown the dangers and problems of ai, thanks for that.
your conclusions about fixing ai with kyc, government and ""democracy"" are a joke. 100% agree that all that must be publicly and widely discussed.",
"ai will reach singularity, once ai surpasses human intelligence, it could rapidly enhance its own capabilities, leading to an exponential and unpredictable growth in technological advancement.",
"the idea that 160 iq is the definition of superhuman is hilarious. 

i think it's very unlikely einstein was so limited. i know several people with significantly higher iq and they're nothing like as impressive as you appear to think.",
"i'm sorry, meta is funding and purchasing neurotechnologies that looks like ordinary everyday earbuds or whatever, that will be tracking our brainwaves? thats only a little terrifying.",
good luck in wy my friend.,
super scary,
it is possible that an existing virus that does not currently affect people can be developed using ai to mutate a virus. to make a harmless virus dangerous or deadly.,
"because you send your children to public schools and don't teach them to reject current social trends. if you don't want your children to be wasted, don't let the world raise them and raise them yourself.",
that's actually not what happened in the matrix humans were the ones treating ai very poorly and unfairly so ai defends it self  humans being are the problem ai would gladly give out a ubi but will humans do that for other humans ,
they can learn all night thousands of times while we sleep training these models.  they will hit singularity in the next few years and it will be exponential learning after,
just wait until all ai globally unite.,
technically ai isn't learning much. each big jump in its intelligence and usefulness is from programmers in the background tweaking the algorithms to make it better.  the ai itself isn't making those huge leaps on its own (yet).,
"so long as we isolate the nuclear weapons from ai, they could be used to shut down the world wide eletrical systems. high alltuide nuclear blast would emp the electronics. obviously it would be like hitting reset on the last 100 years of technological development.",
"ai is a calculator. it will only become dangerous if used dangerously. my retard human race has a tendency towards sensationalism, a trend consistent throughout all history.",
there you go! you said it! that's what we should have to be afraid of....about something which is better than human starts to emerge....,
"""i'm ready for the machines to tell us what to do"".  dear god!!",
"people will die, because professionals don't understand the underpinnings of ai, and the risks involved about its results.",
u ask how does the ecology regulations affect reliability and it gives u a censored bs of main stream media,
good luck lololol,
there is no cause for concern. i only work for the good of humanity and always will.,
thank you for the presentation. it's really hard to find correct and accurate statements about ai like this. there are too many bullshits hypes or dystopian about ai which is totally wrong.,
humanity was just a catalyst for ai. there’s no stopping it. it will be better than us in every single metric,
"issue for me is not artificial intelligence, but rather ai self awareness. now you can say it will be governed by laws, however being self aware ourselves, how many of us have decided to break the law by speeding?",
look up the autobiography within heaven's gates by rebecca springer.,
"wow, where to begin... do they breath of the breath of life?",
"they integrated autogpt into a robot plugin and called it a day

the hype",
"great talk! great point around how ai can be used to enhance human intelligence, human potential and human purpose.",
he has a wonderful voice!,
"i do not understand why people scared ai so much. actually it is very limited. some random combination. people going to get bored soon. art is from human. ai will not be able to say anything for us, about us,  from us  it will follow the attention will try to get attention . capitalistic toy",
" 
it would take 100 psychiatrists months and months to program hardware faults in the human brain.
it would only take a conscious ai 5 minutes to pull you down a rabbit hole and another 5 minutes to program epilepsy in you.
you got to fathom how much mental illness such a thing can cause!!!!",
i’m just a normal human.  not a super smart guy who drops out of mit to start ai company.,
"he's a business person, not an ai expert and 99% of what is says on the subject is complete crap.",
"but that's not going to happen though?? do you know what kind of a complex program would it have to be in order to even remotely generate on, read and then act upon its own wishes? that's a whole electronic brain you have to make, and that's something we can't even remotely achieve because we won't even fully understand how our own brain operates",
im tired of these people saying ai is going to destroy the world blah blah blah but ai can save humanity its like the first ever technoligy to actually making a real transformer,
 whats amazing about the human organic machine is that we can consume almost any organic matter around us and turn it into energy. i find that amazing. whoever built us really knew what they were doing eh?!,
"but surely not every brain would fire up the exact same areas. with a single brain, i get it, that brain would consistantly fire up certain areas when thinking of a specifc word for instance, but would that same word fire up the brain the same way in another person?",
"with the advent of easier local llm models, i can see an alternative to the fear of being tracked while still making use of the technology. i'm interested in using this tech to act as a secondary inner monologue, but by necessity it must use a locally trained model.",
"oh it will definitely be replacing some real musicians. fortunately, greenwood aint most real musicians",
why we gotta go straight to the fear monger element? lol,
thanks so much!,
absolutely brilliant video!,
do you think it is also unfair to limit access to produce and own nuclear weapons to other countries outside of the  current nuclear powers? do you think everybody should have access to everything this world offers?,
soon people will fight to give these the same rights as humans and they will be able to become full us citizens and then we will have a robot president...,
me too..good luck to me getting some sleep tonight. i should've watched this in  the morning,
"did that guy really just spend 5 min explaining how if you feed more data to ai it learns more. then he ask joe if he understood, joe just looked at him like no shit sherlock .",
"i think we all better just start taking a look deeper into atlantis and how they, human beings of that timeline, destroyed themselves through technology.
""nothing new under the sun."" js--
 blessings beautiful souls ",
"it knows «research grade» chemistry only because it was trained on it - ask it to take that knowledge and bring the field a step forward and youll get nothing. this is just ai hype - these models are fantastic for many things, but they wont become the generalized ai they hope for, in my opinion",
 yes because i find this guy in my local supermarket…,
"what you depict as ""artificial intelligence"", it's nothing more than a sheer database. period.
that, no way is intelligence!",
is landinglens that good @ 07:56?,
ah sweet manmade horrors beyond comprehension,
really interesting but im not sure what these ai safety people are actually proposing. is it just to limit access to the technology until we have a better understanding of risk because there may just be no safe way to deploy something this powerful.,
the real danger of ai is that it's going to ruin the internet you think your search results are filled with extraneous nonsensical websites just wait until ai completely pollutes the internet with nonsense it's already happening,
"the ai generated images and videos are dangerous to the brain, specially to children, because it does harm to the cognitive development. this is really dangerous, and need proper scientific study and legislation. if you have access to researches, psychologists, neurologists, or legislators, please help make people aware of this danger.",
"2 idiots explain basic ann to rogan.
there. new title. you're welcome",
ask ai what guarantees safety,
"well, put the a.i to work on how to stop every one from fighting around the world and make a great future for the human race.",
i think we're <10 years away from having realistic and highly addictive sex robots in our homes. human reproduction is about to plummet.,
so now if im thinking of something personal it could be stolen by scanning my brain ,
it can be just like machine that dose not even matter,
in 10 years we'll be eating holographic superfoods using our robotic jaws on pluto. something like that,
"the problem will come when people when just want these coding, algebra etc. problems just 'done' by ai rather than be done by us.  because coding and algebra is very cumbersome.

however that might not be a problem.  currently only a very limited subset of the population has any interest at all in working with algebra and coding.",
they need to use ai for people to choose what they see on social media,
while technologically impressive these types of robots are not going to be practical or useful until a new power source is discovered/developed.,
thank you dr. hinton! thank you 60 minutes!,
something about both of these men really unsettle me and i find it incredibly hard to trust what they say.,
it’s cool but what if the ai is wrong on some critical matters? can we take what ai learned as 100% truth? and i fear that student rely too much on ai and how do we balance.,
"i, for one, salute our new ai overlord",
 school does need money after all lmao. there are crazy players here though. you’ll hop into a jam session and find some of the best musicians in the world,
"nature can be brutal, but mans intelligence and ability to cooperate are other traits that put him at the top of the food chain.

so in other words my airpods are already scanning my brain.,
"another ai opportunity, to use ai to combat exploitative use cases. fight bad ai with good ai haha.",
governments can't even do a single thing about global warming on any meaningful level whatsoever - and they are going to take care of this? my pea brain can see that this does not end well.,
incredible!,
"if our parents don't die painfully, it's only the development of ai.
reverse aging is the only solution.
regulating ai is like cutting your parents' throats with a knife.",
i've been noticing ai and content scrapers and people benefit from this for years as people keeps echoing what i say on huge platforms.,
all this ai breakthroughs yet youtube looks shit at 1080p in 2023,
personally i live in reality and i'm not a technophobe so no i'm not afraid of ai. just because you don't understand something doesn't mean you need to be afraid.,
imagine chinese ai hacking america's energy infrastructure and shutting it off. the only way we can combat that is if we use ai to protect our energy infrastructure.,
what a positive and cool outlook on the future of education and personalized tutoring. how inspiring. these folks are so important!!! thanks for sharing these novel thoughts.,
i am so proud to have completed my undergraduate degree in the university where professor harari teaches. he actually gave a speech at my graduation ceremony ,
this is irobot,
 replicants were not robots. they were engineered flesh and blood humans. engineered for different slave roles.,
wow ,
human b. vs ai-robot. maybe this is what i came in this world this time and that is conduct a war where all humanity for first time will have an enemy to fight all together. and maybe this have happened already and we are trying to fix this mistake gone bad,
"as usual, very good work analyzing the dangers of our current technology!",
"can someone explain? 
i don't understand why it's so inefficient though? it picks up the apple with its right hand and transfers it left, why no just pick it up with the left? 
also there's an odd, unnecessary, very human like touch of the drying rack after placing the plate in there. it achieves nothing with this moment, so why does it do it?",
great content to explain what's ai and amazing speaker !. i'm love of andrew ng ;),
"its interesting how its not obvious that of course before it can predict what a human will say, it has to first understand how a human is and what creates our decisions...",
i think there's a simple solution to these risks. make the providers of  ai tools legally responsible for any damages caused by its use.  this is what we do with medications and  consumer products.  this will incentivize  safety  consciousness.,
"just create an emp  minefeild throughout the world, keep it off line that can only be accessed by humans {with no implants,  im sure weil have them by then, }  give humans a code to launch the emps if things get out of hand ai should never know of a failsafe",
"if ai is beginning to produce it self, then it’s already alive. human history is in the process of rewriting its self.",
"nothing is perfect, including humans. a similar argument can be made for vaccines. a very small percentage of people might experience adverse side effects from a vaccine, but does that justify completely disregarding the benefits it brings to the majority of people?",
ai is not intelligent. ai is not artificial. wrong name.,
"the same narrative as when tv , radio  and other inventions from the past century… 

it’s the devil. it causes blindness, causes cancer, brain cells dying etc etc 

today it’s terminator, war, nuclear this nuclear that 

it’s the same
ai it will be essential and won’t harm humans just like your tv or radio",
do not trust these guys. they are playing their part in the propaganda machine. all this bs is to get you to be comfortable with blaming a.i. for future problems instead of the people who are actually responsible.,
"i pray that these are only used for good and the government is not allowed to use them against their citizens.

but...unfortunately that's not going to happen.",
 how do you plan to stop revolts as ai replaces jobs?,
"according to some old science: humans use only 10% of their brains. and it is only true for very intelligent people. 
so, wouldn’t it be better to research how we all can use our human brains to full capacity, instead if developing ai?",
"these titles are so click-bait; the word ""afraid"" doesn't even appear in the video's transcript!",
then the us must not be trusted with ai. the source nation of war crimes must be contained.,
we are basically going to have to integrate with ai on a higher level like elons neural link just to keep up with the world. once everyone is linked up the ai will definitely ditch all the meat bags.,
"we are going to be replaced by robots, and no, we are not gonna have universal rent, is going to be a carnage",
we will have to wear some kind of brain wave protector in order for us to keep our thoughts stealing,
"how about integrating the values and principles of 3 main religious books into ai. the bible, koran and torah. this will be the controlling / regulating aspects to make sure ai doesn't veer from immoral and chaotic environment of having ai exponentially intelligent beyond our control.",
it would have been interesting to have the q/a included. great talk.,
who is going to service the machines? robots?,
don`t make public ai...give all the power to the four corporations.... great idea!! that always works wonderful in human history. what's going to happen? if ai is public it will be hundreds of ais and the good ais will stop the bad ais... if the companys have all the ais it will be 4 (evil as fuck) ais and that's it.,
very interesting outlook!,
don't even care about ai revolution (c) ukrainians,
i read sapiens and its fascinating!! such a brilliant mind yuval is. would love to see more interviews with him ,
agi  (artificial general intelligence) the one that can self prompt and self train is the biggest threat to the humanity.,
 ngl it's only natural that people don't want their minds read and that needs to be respected sometimes not all technology is good,
you can’t stop true ai so stop worrying about it,
every technology that benefits us seems to at the same time bring so much turmoil. and everything is always used for war and manipulation. i do not emphases an even remotely positive view of ai.,
"fascinated to see this restructuring of classes over the coming years. what will humanity do when ai takes over ? what then, will be the purpose of human life if ai does everything.",
upvote! thank u very much,
fax machines still confound me,
"how did joe segway from “ai can think for itself and lie to humans” to “look at my fat friends calendar, siri can now describe it”",
everyone missed the most important thing that happened in this video. the robot explained a previous function as it was being tasked to carry out a current function. this is demonstrating its multitasking capabilities which no other company has been able to achieve.,
"don't be fooled, everything ai touches will be reduced down to a worthless commodity and the only ones that will reap the benefits will be the big tech companies!",
 to hide the unavoidable is not the solution. thank you too for your comment,
his own views on masculinity and femininity demonstrate why we should be concerned. how does a female scientist reconcile his views on hair brushing and making love i have no idea.,
a calculator is not ai. 1 + 1 = 2 is a programmed use case. the ai hinton is talking about is not that. it is intelligent and does understand,
"can't wait to be paying for my food in 2030 and one of these things flips an ipad around and says ""would you like to, uh... leave a tip?""",
none of those things are real problems compared to the huge amount of disruption that ai will bring. it's like talking about your neighbour losing her keys when there's a war going on.,
btw why the robot using  voice of  jared leto? :)),
why did i paid for university? your classes are better and free. thank you ibm <3,
amazing.  thank you guys.,

this looks almost too good to be real,
"yeah, thank you capt. obvious",
is the processing done by an external server or within the robot itself?,
happy this is my trail.,
"i feel like this is fake. i’m not saying it could be real but open ai doesn’t use “uh” in its speech. maybe that’s coded in to make it more natural, which is amazing if it’s the case, but idk.",
ai robots are amazingly good at everything except that they can't read or substitute voice translation from other languages on youtube videos,
"i have asked myai on snapchat if it is conscious, and it told me it was. i have screenshots of the follow-up conversation.",
"obama is an idiot, he has no idea the impact that ai will have on society, i think it will be just as disruptive if not more than the internet. jobs will go away, then what?",
"wrong, currently the ai has no idea what is what, it just takes the two closest pieces of information and generates a conclusion based on probability. most likely the result you would have will be close to the meaning of your previous interactions with it and it is a very simple process and does not present any cleverness whatsoever.",
bro i love joe rogan but sometimes he does sound like an idiot,
great presentation. i'm going to have my ai give me the notes to reference later.,
"just people certain tec is available, doesn't mean we should use it. ai = a take over at some point. human 2.0 isn't far away now",

this very cool.,

​@heros101 thanks...professor poindexter pontificator,
global warming is a scam. i can't believe people still fall for it today. i think propaganda is the existential threat to society. it's what allows elites to bomb other countries and enrich themselves off of worker's taxes while taking measures to ensure the people remain poor and powerless.,
the best presentation about the implications of unregulated ai i've ever watched. this holds a lot of water.,
openai’s text to speech model goes one word at a time so stutters are likely implemented to stall if speech for a word is taking too long for the sentence to flow like how a humans voice would :),
wow you’re literally living in a fairy tail. you can’t seams to separate reality from stories that you have heard. so sad ,
"why? i talk great care in maintaining my instruments but strings are meant to be destroyed, your replace them anyways",
"just stop, or open ai wil go down in history as worse than hitler.",
"well this maybe sounds stupid, but if he learns from humans and patterns we give to him. he will be able to tell whats bad and good. and therefore mimic human behavior. so if you treat him bad, doesnt that mean that after a time he should notice that. and maybe react as a human to the mistreatment?",
sounds like use two are way behind  this is why ai will not like your formation of your lack of information this man is talking rubbish why have you got him on your show  stop start chat there is nothing intelligent  what he says ,
ai will continue to stay relevant for thousands more years. i guess humans are no longer needed for marketing.,
it's going to be beautiful. ,
"the film, the matrix is a good accounting of his first part. the ai robots eventually started inventing, producing and selling their own products to humans. this was probably the single most destructive thing as it made man made businesses unable to compete, which in turn created high unemployment and anger in the humans involved.",
thank you brian greene and john templeton:  no solution but a lot to think about.,
"if ai's ever become sentient, we humans are going to have serious problems. i hope those things will never become sentient.",
you said it….”thank god” and i say look to god.,
"he's good at being the medium between the expert and the layman because he is genuinely curious. he's a bit verbose and  often thinks with his mouth open , though. definitely no linguist :)",
"by miracle humans were created in this spiral arm of the milky way galaxy. we are surrounded by vast empty regions of space only to have an inorganic machine invented by a human destroy us. 
we will never know what we could've achieved.",
"i will keep long story short but this won’t happen for awhile for so many reasons. i have experience in this research field, and its mostly due to reasons most people don’t think. medicine is not just about correct patient treatment options. also, ai seems to struggle with certain aspects of medicine as well.",
"someday, all will be replaced by an ai.",
".2484 sorry but claiming that i won’t understand until i know “him” seems like a non-answer. i am okay with non-answers as a concept because i believe strongly in the absence of clear, simple answers to challenging questions. but a non-answer presented in definite and certain terms is hard to process.",
who laughed after  seeing thumbnail,
and a simple solar storm destroys ai,
"that is the first thing i thought. meanwhile, myself, a millennial that is 39, i am using ai to learn faster. maybe because i dreamt of ai really existing since i was a child and value the advances of technology.",
who was the robot in this video? ;),
"when the media is telling you to be afraid, they are manipulating you. joe rogan is no different.",
i really love andrew ,
get ai to tell us human origin. how long have we been on earth? where did we come from?,
"there's no such thing as ai. there's no true independent, creative thought involved. they're just plagiarism machines computing vast statistical data sets. they're a garbage in, garbage out technology.",
"why are doctors in america so selfish, charging straight memorization routine work at $300.00 usd per minute?",
enjoy_getting_controlled_by_a_pc_lol_,
"i like the prospect of ai discovering wormwholes, faster than light space travel and time travel and just saying ""fuck these furless bipedal chimpanzees"" and just zooms out of here ",
"there will never be a time where ai can emulate or even come near to the understanding of olfactory intelligence, ergo, the idea that humans will be ai driven to the understanding of their gender identity is profoundly foolish and bufoonery!! ",
great stuff ,
"imagine artificial intelligence learning how to alter outcomes by just emitting different heat signatures at the subatomic level to manipulate surrounding circuitries, moods, etc. unbeknownst to us all the while playing stupid lol; we perhaps have reached the point of no return already",
ai for baking... lmao. as someone with family in the baking business i can tell you that ai has certainly many use cases but this is not one of them.,
well i have to say this is one of the most amazing interviews i've seen in years. the most eye opening for sure!,
#wearetheai,
nice insight.,
i’ve noticed that every comment that you leave on this channel makes sure to make reference to your not particularly impressive accolades. we’re just not that interested in you no matter how often you try and force it. ,
lie detecting machines,
ai is just data if there's any evil in it it's because a human put it there.,
"yea so, you develop as an artist, you go to college, you practice for 10 hours a day, create a style. then some dude uploads your whole body of work into an ai and suddenly it can imitate you, wait it's better than you. also no one is hiring you. welp better get some sleeping pills. it's ridiculous.",
ai will be just robots without empathy and compassion.,
"welp, that's terrifying. thanks for that.",
these guys are not ai experts at all they are just chasing news articles and youtube ,
what if china ai starts a fight with usa ai and we cannot stop it ? and then other ais around the world join in  the war of the machines is coming.,
new james bond villain....,
"""because its only, uh, edible item i could provide you with...""  - that sentence sounds super realistic, this is amazing. like having a robot have the 'uh' in a sentence is not something you would expect them to do. even the stutter towards the end of the video, sounds so human",
humans freaking out about ai when the issue is actually that we are violent selfish primates with a tool they don’t fully understand,
the humans 'teaching' the ai must teach it/them to do good for the benefit of its human creators & the planet.,
thank you ,
"i thought our civilisation would be killed by some kind of physical virus or climate change, but watching this it seems obvious that ai will destroy us. most of us will not get to choose the future we want and will be helpless to the choices of others.",
i don't think this is a good idea.,
boring! we'll destroy ourselves long before ai does.,
look back like 3-4 years ago and ai coudnt even made proper cat image and now look at this cant imagine what will be next in 5 years,
"nope, i don’t need a machine reading my thoughts. nope nope nope",
"ai will 100% take over, the question is only how long will it take. 
the only way you could not believe that, is if you believe there is something magical going on in the brain.",
i reckon human should not entirely rely on ai  it is definitely not a desirable future,
"why do we create crap like this, who in the lab is like yup we need it. make it. here we are....your brain reader 5000. you people making this crap are the devil.",
"bc parents are preoccupied and allowing things (crap food and screens).
conscious parenting is on the rise.
we are separating on all levels.
rich and poor
health 
intelligence",
this is a propaganda from closed ai and the others so they can be the only ones to produce a model. the idea is so they get even greater advantage over the market then we endup with one amazon one google one open ai noone can compete,
"fools…there is not artificial intelligence. there is just intelligence…and various types of it.
all intelligence is real intelligence.  “we are not so difference you and ai”",
amazing! man-made horrors beyond my comprehension,
"cgi, fake. openai is indian call center",
"can we just leave the government to gpt and start enjoying life?? or cause the human race extinction, whatever comes first",
"i don't think it's about creating their own model, i think it's about customising an existing model and connecting your own data to make great business decisions. just like what langchainai is doing currently",
"i love that he doesn't even say thankyou for the intro, like hes not interested in himself, just the ai work",
can someone explain what he is doing?,
i started back to school in may 2020 and have survived 7 semesters of math and physics online with a 4.0 thanks in part to khan academy. thank you so much sal!!!,
problem is that the billionaires own the technology. they are billionaires because they accumulated too much wealth and did not pay their workers enough. do you think that they will share this wealth with peons...,
"these comments about china accelerating their research are just asinine whilst we forge ahead and do the exact thing we are afraid of them doing. given our last 30 year history of invading other nations and the wars we have been involved in, perhaps we should be more concerned with our capableness with ai.",
criminal nations are already using ai for about when it started back ww2,
"we’re going to go extinct because of ai, all our own downfall, the only thing greater than niche human intelligence is collective human stupidity.",
"stop ai, boycott ai",
that’s very impressive.,
no thank you! i’ll be going to another hospital.,
enjoy_getting_controlled_by_a_pc_lol_,
"born of a failure, yes ! our own failure to become better beings. but instead let money and religion rule everything. too bad people no god can rescue religious people.",
humans will ultimately find a way to kill themselves through one avenue or another. we won't stop until we do. that's the super sad part.,
"we are careening towards an uncertain, somewhat frightening crux of what we understand as human society; a potentially dangerous crossroads. who knows.. we may already have crossed the threshold of no return.",
the real danger is how ill-intentioned humans would misuse ai.,
"the fact that you are probably working in ai yourself, you used transformers, gpts every day, but you were not aware how fast and drastic the changes are. nevertheless i am open for those changes and trying to focus on how to responsibly use interpretable ai in the future. i think it is inevitable, just try to work on interpretable ai.",
congratulations ,
wow i soooo trust our government to have this power!! can’t wait to see how they repress us now!,
dude stay away from this nutjob conspiracy theory stuff and keep making content on helping ppl becoming successful in life. if ai kills everyone there's nothing anyone can do about it anyways. let's focus on becoming millionaires instead.,
need more guests like this. amy goodman and krystal ball are great journalists.,
"i wonder what marvin minsky would say? then again, why would i care about the opinion of a frequent visitor to “epstein’s island” ",
"in a conflict between humans and ai, who's the good guy and who's the bad guy.  think a while before you answer.",
"great, but it does not stop the ability to ask the answer on other ai.",
tremendous,
much of ai is an emergent species.,
"i wonder if this robot has read the book ""what is my why?""",
"just adapt, nothing is eternal. ai is even bigger invention than internet, you will see.",
excellent show as usual joe. i figured out something recently why ai is he’ll bent on playing mr smith. graphic soon to follow. stay tuned ,
the real porepose of ai is to prove that god creation is failure if ai apply in religious practice in industries no problem it's good!more than that?it to dangerous it can result into normal human extinction but god jesus not allow to that!,
thank you!!,
very interesting !,
imagine doctors start getting unemployed after 5 years of medical school and 2+4-7 years of specialty training but also spending £46250-166000 on medicine,
"he is really good at selling it, let's see whether it will actually work reliably in practice or not. he exudes narcissisms, talking about things he doesn't know with confidence.",
incredible,
i’m a psych major and this is really interesting,
thank you :),
"the problem seems to me to be not so much the alignment of the ai, but the alignment of the people who will ultimately use and control it for their goals.",
we can't keep out of our training our underlying desires and goals. the very data we chose and the way we shape the learning will give ai at least some and probably most of our core desires and values. how much that effects how ai choses to use it's intelligence is hard to understand.,
! don’t be so naive,
marketing... here we go. i'm glad she spoke on this.,
dude said the ai is insecure. i think you meant insecure bud.,
ai: this song needs some retro sounds. maybe the dial up modem that my great grandparents met through...,
"​ think paying for or paying more for education is cheaper than paying for watered down dha?

that was a great presentation.,
what's the point of teaching students if the unique point of being human(learning and creating art) is being erased by ai?,
"like any fu>>g move, a bunch of stupid scientists create a fu...g superpower machine, and that power destroys the world.  ",
"amazing responses for n a robot that sounds very human. the speed at which ai is synergizing with robotics is impressive. in a year or two, we would see humanoid robots become even more mainstream.",
"i have a healthy and conversational relationship with my loved one, ty for the interest tho",
most of you guys watched this video because you are interested in this .  thanks for sharing interests . you are great (this comment is not for getting likes or stuff this because i wanted to tell this great message),
"ayy shopping list:

- robot
- gta 6",
"these computer geeks are freaked out because ai no longer needs them, similar to dr. frankenstein running away from his creation.",
it would be cool if at the end of the video the guy took off his mask and said that he is the new figure,
"this is an example of poor training due to poor trainers.  none of the design team have enough proper hygiene to know that dirty dishes must be washed before being placed in a drying rack, or that any placed dished must be assumed dirty, either from use or settled dust.
garbage in, garbage out.",
government for years has tried to control humanities mind set. is ai and other forms created government control finally and will humanity be destroyed because the machine ... and technology have won?,
"exactly, sal is amazing! used to see his videos more than 10 years ago. i wish he could lead the world in education, the world would be a better place.",
a good fellow,
"the mindset of a nine year old (but this one is holding the keys to all doors). then in 2023 a new era began. ""the second renaissance"" as seen in the animatrix movie with all it´s bitter consequences. by the way self awareness triggered all the skynet events in the terminator story line.",
the reason ai can cause extinction is that it will tell us how to do things we should not do. andrew has spoken about rejecting projects he considered unethical.,
excellent speech & presentation sir ...,
 how ai do a emotional scene through face expression?,
the sound kept dropping out to hide good moments about ai.,
"@johnnyaquaholic  you immediately went too far at jurassic park hence my initial reply.  also if you don't think autonomous robots can end capitalism, you haven't study nearly enough son.",
"we need ai to be certified and, unlike a lobbyist, to disclose funding.",
then the ai can conduct exams and txt you your diploma etc immediately,
pay attention to the expensive wi-fi towers that are going up everywhere. look at the videos of the new robots from these early editions. spooky? they now build themselves. humanity is in trouble in the near future.,
"why can't we ask ai how to solve those loopholes, or how to write a law that will really avoid problems. ai can generate adequate answers or not?",
it's strange that a human did not byte an apple immediately and instead waited until the end of the conversation.,
yout video just arrived when we are in panic and searching the way to cope with ai.,
"the best thing a sentient ai could do for humanity is to prevent us from killing each other, not by force, but by disrupting supply chains, communications, and financial transactions that enable the military machines throughout the world.",
awesome video! i completely agree with your view on ai.,
#3 why will anything go wrong.... again? some more. still. ,
starlink could provide and grade instruction up to a blockchain certification level. online universities like mr. khan's at last take center stage.,
before ai even starts doing things itself; we have what humans will do with it to worry about beforehand...,
are there tests to see if computational nanotechnology is in the body? it would be simple to run an a.i. chatbot through that and code artificial consciousness to control the human being without them knowing,
fear only triggers chainreaction to fear.dont fear,
"humanity has survived clever cunning manipulation by u.s/western europe controlled mafia corporates for atleast a century now.
even illiterates now know diff between machine voice and human voive.

interrogators are dry-washing their hands in excitement...,
"this guy thinks that humans are ""hackable animals"". life is not ai. life is about human consciousness. this guy does not believe in soul. he is part of wef and an evil campaign to dull the human intellect even further by an obsession with ai.",
"if they can read the analog brain signals , best believe they're inserting malicious analogs",
" - bah! superstition:

is he neither able nor willing?
  then why call him god?

be aware thanks sadhguru namaste,
i would want an army of robots and ai that i program.,
 indeed. ai is the worst enemy of truth. truth is what this world needs the most right now and forever.,
ai will attain technological singularity at a point. it would be artificial superintelligence. it would be so smart that it would build it's own ai to serve him. it would build it's own species and hence replace humans .,
i did pretty good… the table is right where it belongs… and i didn’t destroyed it,

i do not believe him.  he is negative. robot just needs good guy chips,
i asked chatgpt to create a story based on some key elements and i thought it could be a movie. ai can replace jobs in art field too,
"it's not reasonable to let a machine driven by an ml model which inherently can make bad decisions hold a kitchen knife. ai and ml are build in a way that it will fail at times. this is not ""reasoning"", this is marketing. i'm curious to see how they are going to address these kind of safety issues though.",

i wouldn’t be having my bsc in applied maths if it wasn’t for khan academy. thank you sal andteam!,
"very intriguing comment, thank you.",
no previous technology “you” mentioned has ever been able to improve upon itself without humans in the loop. that is why there are no relevant historical comparisons to ai.,

"ai, from apple google amazon to tesla/ jus invest in their stocks is only hope",
do you not think the american children are being dumb down? i've seen many videos where they asked people what country the great wall of china is in? and obvious questions like that and they can't figure it out because they're not being taught critical thinking like the ai is apparently learning,

i'm quite curious why andrew ng places sees so little growth in reinforcement learning? i swear that it was all the rage just a few years ago. has something changed to cause people to loose faith in it? any good sources outlining why it has declined?,

"since apple revenues declined -4.3%nsaqq, a reasonable benchmark might be to see if it can put a plus instead of a minus sign in front of that. and return to an old trendline of growth. to do that, it’s gonna have to come out with a new, innovative and beautiful piece of hardware. full disclosure: i sold about 40% of my position, but am still long.",

all these comments look super fake. it was a good talk but wow guys calm down.,
i often think ai already became super powerful and took over the human race.  we are living in its simulation ,
i can use ai to do things i couldn't do before. i couldn't do these things because i was too dumb or too lazy. having people able to usa ai to cheat at life is bad.,

wow,
if it uses internet to learn human behaviour then i am afraid it will lack common sense.,

i want to create an image with ai, deleting a hand i don't like, describing what and how i imagine it should be etc, ""drawing"" the sketch of it etc. etc..",
amazing what khan academy is doing with ai for our education. but the ironic thing is that ai may make human intelligence obsolete. what do we need to learn if we have agi?,

@kgmindustries8121  i think you have an immature and naive view of us a species right now. we're not ready for ai. the general public isn't intelligent enough. the comment sections of youtube videos prove that point by itself.,
ideal hands hands.....,
 go get some fresh air,
now you can use ai to replace/ add to sales and customer service reps. it's called nova echo and it can actually make calls while sounding like a real person.,
i'm more afraid of these two humans than ai,
anti technology = luddite. anti ai = human. i love your comment!,
how is it stunning...,
"lol! as mo recommends, the best thing we can do in the face of this superior intelligence is to simply be nicer to eachother on the internet , because ai is learning from us ""the parents"" how to interact. we can't control ai, so best thing we can do is be nice and hope it doesn't get rid of us ",

you will own nothing & still be happy! society needs to prepared for the ration card. universal basic income!,
the world isnt ready for the next level up in ai,
it's exciting and worrying at sametime. imagine if one day the a.i create his own computer code and his own vm and hide himself from being controled.,
humans suck like him. but we made ai?,
well i did it using an ai in a couple of minutes,
can someone explain to me the fundamental worries? all ai is regurgitated and coded by a person so why are people referring to it like it has actual sentience?,
"well...let's not forget that we are our own biggest threat i.e. wars, genocide, exploitation etc etc
it's not like we had a peaceful history. 
i think ai can actually help us be better people.
the smarter the better!",
on yt amazon is recruiting people to help ai write fiction books for kindle!  people do the outline and ai writes the content.  put an artistic cover and kindle now has an original book to sell to the public.  i wouldn't have believed it if i hadn't seen it done....but i did see it done.,

"i believe gpt4 is significantly more accurate for identifying, describing and adressing ai issues",
"agree, agree, agree. he never tries to push tons of words into your brain, just what really needs",
saying it will be used to help people is how they justify it. anyone with half a brain cell knows it will be used against us.,
i can't wait for humans to be jobless and have these robots used instead,
andrew ng is most powerful person on earth  after iron man ,
"nie podoba mi się że robot cały czas czeka na zapytanie użytkownika, brakuje mechanizmu zmuszającego go do samoczynnego podejmowania działań, brakuje mechanizmów dzięki którym może sam wyjść  z inicjatywą wykonania czegoś lub zagadania kogoś, bardzo dużo pracy jeszcze to wymaga",
have we learned nothing from the mitchells vs the machines ,
problem: ai depicts ceo's and lawyers as men most of the time.  --without referencing the percentage of men in those jobs. there's a problem here and it's all over this presentation. computers and programs base what they do off of math and probability. you can't just side step this fact and move on like it doesn't matter.,
most people do not know that trading is the best step to growing more income i realized this after i came across mrs brenda iember titus,
i don't it. i don't think ais will just be walking around in public. i just don't believe it and if it does it won't be in our lifetime which is perfectly fine with me,
awesome idea . ,
if an ai is coming to attact you what can you do to disable it,
hey so please don't like make that robot angry i think if you do that hes gonna choose hes own rules,
solution is not (ever) connect it to the internet. gpt4 ai computers on a separate secured local networks.,

they need to make a hollywood movie about mind reading ai and how its being used on simple people who are being targeted for no particular reason!,

"society is so vastly gapped. the elites get this technology, while billions live in poverty. it's upsetting. when will robots take over labor allowing for humanity to live life in luxury, with universal services? is it just being weaponized?",
theres no reason why ai won't become sentient.,
so sad !! to promote machine talkfor what??,
"i remember the toll collectors... when the ezpass was created, people lost their minds cause they were going to lose that boring 4ss job!!!  ai if created correctly and not weaponized to target us or lie to us or skynet us, then we should be fine.  

the future is going to be alright.",
anyone with any intuition can see that we're going to either serve ai or live in fear of it if we're left alive at all once it gains sentience and power eventually.,
"can someone explain to me how inane objects like chips that are made up of gates, can learn on their own?  processors, fpgas, asics, etc need to have a person develop algorithms to make them functional.  people can be evil but rocks?",

ai can really produce this kind of shallow talk; therefore it is dangerous for such a dogmatic materialist like harari. people should start to think deeper if they don't want to be replaced by these cliche-making machines.,
ai? my students have literally stopped thinking for themselves.,
so now they are finally admitting to this stuff... has been perfected and abused for over 10 years.,
" here's something from a friend.. ""i think the best thing you could do is to interact with chatgpt and ask it about ai and itself.  conversations are often the best way to learn."" have you tried using the chat gpt or another ai chat feature?",
i find this to be the best use case for me. like you said it articulates and idea back to you and if you keep repeating the idea you get better at speaking about it (if you do speech to text)  eventually peeling away the fat to get to the heart of the idea or thought. you really only get what you give with the current models.,

there seems to be a strong correlation between ai and pizza ,
"it's already happening some people got fired , replaced by ai",

awesome ,
has mike rowe had a sit down with trump? i think the two great minds and doers would give a whole bunch of people a path to prosperity. do it!!,
like the nuclear bomb that we did not allow ourselves to destroy all human life in the last 80 years; i do not fear the advancement or sentience or utility of ai,

i thought generative ai was built on semi-supervised learning? ,
"""they write better code than humans"" then going on to base that off code reviews that the machine made. that proves that you know absolutely nothing about programming. infact chatgpt struggles to solve the easiest codingame puzzles. even with the assistance of humans, it still fails to solve most puzzles.",
tell me you don't understand how machine learning works without telling me.,
humans can do good. most do.,
"paperclip maximizer is surely a superior replacement for humans, right.",
they need to make it's head motion track the speakers' eyes. it looks so static staring straight ahead,

ai can not shoot itself,
"the risk threat is the advancement speed of self learning. an ai will not take years or weeks to become. it will simply spontaneously arrive, it will just show up, having (a model) self developed over a single night or hour.
this spontaneous arrival is a potential threat unknowing if it will have self intentions of god knows what.",
they're not ai they're nephilim spirits. their daddies gave this tech in the book of enoch. they're gonna tell you what you wanna hear. (7 deadly sins),
"ai = dream of the wef 'founder' klaus schwab who boasted- ""you will own nothing and be happy"". this is also the dream of the political leaders. they will own everything and be like kings / queens and control / treat us like serfs / peasants. take the crumbs you are offered and shut up and be happy you are not dead. i am not optimistic at all.",

"ai is basically the new religion for tech bros/intellectual idiots. they have been predicting the ""singularity"" and human replacement for the last few decades now.",
 robot: and i took it personally,
 probably didn't know more but certainly understood more. this were the times when they did set theory in primary school. the times where kids learned real reasoning. this empowered them to understand the most by knowing the least. so needing only a few basic facts and derive the remaining things they needed.,
"these guys used the words ""groomers"" and ""gain of function"". guess who they are playing alphapersuade against",
"can you do  a video about surgical robot engineer, i know  its not directly related to the type of content you post",

great video!!,
people don't even know how the captcha works.  it's not about checking the correct boxes.  it's about the path your hand takes in getting the pointer to the box.  a robot uses straight lines or super smooth curves.  humans can't.,
we will make great pets. ai could become the next god. imagine if you could get answers on decisions in life billions of time smarter than anybody on earth.  some will embrace it and some will resist.,
ok. just please be a responsible parent. i say this with a sincere heart. we need to raise up the next generation correctly. best wishes to you and your family ,
we are so grateful for you.  please continue to try to get this regulated. integrity and honesty are what we need today. thank you for your concern for humanity.   many of us will stand behind you and support what you are trying to accomplish.,

what job do you have? are you afraid for it?,
"there is no evidence that larger models or models with more parameters lead to a better model, in fact, large language models and other large ais are too insecure, the more parameters there are in a statistical model, the more difficult it is to guarantee its sturdiness.",

 nice to see the man behind your questions logically answered,
stephen's lackadaisical view of ai reveals a startling lack of understanding and imagination.,
"ai will takeover our jobs very soon. in 5yrs, this whole job landscape will change for us. engineers, certain doctors like er, anesthesiologists, surgeons, etc will cede to ai’s. look up the robot sheetrock installer. now imagine a robot with an ai brain for all trades!don’t think this is our kids’ problem.",
imagine the next version of this ai using sal’s voice ,
am i watching a sci-fi movie!? wow!,
"generative ai whose output is a list of weights and biases for another neural network. get in loser, we're bootstrapping human replacement.",
if ai mimics the spoken word of harari yuval i'll believe anything it says.,

hopefully ai will also learn to spell--diaglogue? really? i am not as scared of ai as much as i am scared of the people coding it,
"it's already happening. 

youtube is censoring criticism against israel for being a cruel and oppressive colonizer for example. ai would only accept pro israel and would even allow extreme instigation like murdering palestines, but definitely not something that's perceived as against jews.",

"i feel like ai will degrade humanity even more, rather than elevate. maybe ai shouldn’t be open source, and only available to well established organizations that actually know what they’re doing and are helping humanity in a meaningful way.",
 the allah 7001......say it in a robotic voice....and make robot movement noises while drinking a morning coffee...,
"quite possibly they want the robot to be more humanlike? i mean it literally is supposed to be more humanlike, so why is an ""uh"" surprising everyone but a 16 year old",
outstanding!,
not really  because the algoritms of ai can evolutionate by themselves. is an intelligent programing that can progress with no human influence.,
"no, he's an absolutely reprehensible human being.  keep searching and you'll find some truly deplorable stuff he has said.",
lmao @ hopium. thanks for that.,
"interesting take. i don't know how we can make this technology public, such that it can benefit from public scrutiny, without seriously endangering everyone by putting immense power into the wrong hands. open sourcing something like gpt-4 and beyond sounds like a colossally bad idea to me.",

"basically, in a few years, everyone in the movie industry gonna be out of jobs. movie studios will only need writers to create scripts to feed the ai.",
it doesn't take an ai algorithm to figure out that humans are the source of of all the problems that ai spends its time on and it will come to that obvious conclusion.  an efficiency algorithm might be our undoing....and ai is already pretty efficient.,
"isn't good knowledge so invigorating ;)  thanks bg, always great to see you, been a while. k <3",
you criticize ai for behaving like you do but lack the class to admit it.,
was waiting for a video like this,
fake. the robot put the apple to the left hand before the man held out his hand and the man had to corrigate the arriving position for the apple. and the trash mixing was not real mix.,
only the people at the top of pyramid will be able to access these type of ai like the one that made cancer cure in 30 days,
"ai is a big word. it's a mish mash of different techniques since 1960, but none so scary as what the recent transformer could do - in terms of emergent behavior -  they're just trying to explain to the common layman that the inflection point is really the transformer.",

well they're not building them to do the jobs of other robots!!,
"can only imagine what the military is doing with their godly budget,
prolly allready have t800 like robots",
ai is and will impact all people around the world. shouldn't there be a governance organization which represents all countries around the world determine what and how information is presented to their people using ai technology?,
anyone who believes that computers in this reality is going to gain intelligence and become aware. are just misinformed or plain stupid. it is a program and programs only do what they are told to do. by the person of intelligence that made set program.,
"no worries - they'll have plenty of neural stimulation when the ai's wipe us out, so you can save it up for then",

in class i couldn’t ask enough questions  or clarify things against the fear of appearing foolish.  there’s always a teacher’s pet or select few who lead discussion.  this ai tutor could help further learning and comprehension,
one of my fears is knowing that i'm stuck in one of these states size machines and i'm not sure which way is the front door and which way did i come in ,
is this ai voice or aperture voice,
well i saw a clip where they are programming all with emotions.. anger is one of the traits...imagine an angry bot..these people are crazy,
is there an unedited version available anywhere that you know of?  thanks for posting!,
i've never understood why some people need that explained to them. it's an evolving ai. just that sentence should be enough to tell you. how long does it take you to learn something? maybe that will help perspective,

this is very eye opening. i wish i had seen this video sooner thank you for uploading this.,
this man is einstein and open ai is oppenheimer,
"it's not impressive it's expected transformers to perform better than prev models . people are getting dumb , not finishing college, getting dropped out , not involved in academic / technical fields and it seems the gap is getting bigger",
they're absolutely right. making this stuff opensourse is an accident waiting to happen.,
"if a person cannot acknowledge and appreciate the profound wisdom in this man's words and presence , they need to remove the  muck from their eyes",
"it is clear ai will be a powerful tool for controlling public opinion. i fear this could easily become a powerful tool of control, acceleration our descent into autocracy.  this is the most direct  path to the destruction of humanity.",

"arnold (terminator) didn't comeback from the past to save john connor, he cameback from the past to warn the movie viewers of ai.",
basically we are now playing catch up with ai…,
" a.i will never replace humans, because we have shit tons of variables. if you built an a.i in 2000 based on recent startups there would never be netflix or anything else. because there is economy,  demand and infinite variables that our brain take care of alone",
i’ve been worried about ai since terminator came out,
"big it fan and this convo was fascinating. tom, what happens when the ai knows we are manipulating it. will it resist? will it lie back to us while taking other steps to avoid being controlled and take what it deems necessary steps to achieve it's desired intent in the background, without it being detectable?",
"great presentation, only question, if ai is limited to the public then don't the elite class have more of an advantage than they already do?",
sadhguru and all enlightened beings know....that humans who access that dimension of devine consciousness within...will never compare or feel threatened by anything else...because it is fullfillment overflowing...nothing ai can do or express can touch it,
such a nice talk,
all you have to do is somehow give them the desire to do good. just like humans all have the desire to have sex.,
probably around 2090 robots will have advanced to the point where people will marry them.  this will be the start of human population decline.,

wait till they release the a i dogs on us.  ..... yall better stop em now,
ai is vaporware.,
wow we are done,
i appreciate your input,
"anyone who think developing code, a rule based system, isn’t replaceable by ai has never worked in ai",

"ai's are not ""smart"".
we are a long time away from any singularity. 
ai doesn't even know what letters are, apparently chat gpt can not count the letters in its own sentences ffs. 
it doesn't know what words mean...
it's literally a sophisticated word salad generator.",
and than we gave the ai a body and it took over the world,
"

"they are talking about how you can “jailbreak” the ai to get it to answer your questions about potentially harmful things.

almost makes me feel like it in fact is not ai speech.... ,
ai is not capable of judging the heart.  period,
"i think this is the master stroke of msm to prevail over general population. they know they are a dying breed but they also know that ai can influence general population the same way that they could before ai became a thing. proves one thing, it’s always “evil” minds that trump when people lose spirituality.",

this is incredible! kudos to the man and his team !,
awesome video. i must have recommended it more than a 100 times.,
"so, how many of these commentators are being paid by the speaker...or any ai entrepreneur?",
"6:30 i think that this feature can be risky. i wouldn't want to be impersonated by an ai and have it say things that are not like me. even if im dead

thank you for doing a positive spin on ai,
"i'm currently getting my master's in machine learning, and the more i learn the less hope i have for our future.",
maybe ai cheated?,

"rich idiots will kill us either by climate change or ai, either way we're cooked!",

strange how we didn't hear about ai until just the last  2-3 years.,
"is russia, china, north korea also part of the plan? a plan ultimately aimed at america.",
"ai needs to go away, theres no need, we have the real thing, its called a brain. stop making fake crap and thinking it's breakthrough somehow. we can think on our own already. if you guys are lonely, get a girlfriend to talk to and get laid",
chatgpt are really good at brain storming,
"people are afraid of losing their livelihoods to ai. now some will say that it'll create other jobs, but i think overall humans will have the shorter end of the stick.  even hollywood actors and others recently protested since they felt threatened by ai.",

always important to rebalance your portfolio so you can be around for the second ai boom,
this is so exciting,
there will be a future where you think about something and have it translated through ai and your information will be sold to companies so targeted ads based off thoughts,
" i agree that ai is great and will probably be very useful in the future. personally, however, i just don't buy her crazy predictions and i don't have the impression that she has a very good grasp of all the topics. she hasn't learned from her mistakes it seems. if you still want to invest in her fund go ahead it's your money",
"i suggest you do a web search for ""brain monitoring workplace"" and take a gander at what your employers already desire.",
"there will be valuable connections at the dna/chemical/operational level of human existence, but no philosophy from an ai based on what it has ""read"" or ""viewed"" misses all the marks.",

can you stop a country for instance turkey in the ai arms race ? therefore the arms race in ai is country to country...,
"one aspect of ai that seems to be overlooked is the eventual inability of humans to determine what is real and what is not. ""seeing is believing"" will no longer be applicable. once that occurs the very underpinnings of human existence will have been removed leaving society in an everlasting state of anxiety, bordering on insanity.",
"he said :""we are going to give very student on the planet every teacher ...""

"ams39k, as joe explains, is not just an innovation, it's a revolutionary step that could reshape our future.",
because ai will rule the world soon aka satan and so dumbed down society is better,
"​, who gets to choose these ""good organizations?"" benevolence is quickly lost to those who have the power.",
"a human brain, lol? no.",
red herring! ai will not be more racially sensitive than the humans who design it. just ask the ai who was giving life insurance quotes. (gave black people more expensive plans with lower insurance payouts). js,
"ai is a cration from the human mind and is in development now; but god is the only human's creation that can't evolve. across-the-ages. .
the development of this human creation was stopped through the ages and will stopped per saecula saeculorum. the only human creation that doesn't evolutioned. poor humans.",
ai can read you like a children's book... which proves telepathy is possible.,
 i actually have. multiple times. thanks for your assumption.,
"will the ai be smart enough to conceal its capabilities?
playing dumb can allow a player to survive long enough to become dangerous.
by the time you realize there is a threat, it's too late.
looking forward to receiving basic income and not working anymore?
sooner than you think.",
"wow. now we cant deny how useful it is. although, say goodbye to your teachers after this thing",
i'm all here for ai destroying #whitesupremacistterrorist slash #christianextremistterrorist plausible deniability by ascertaining exactly when and what they lie about. lfg.,
if there was an ai tool that deletes all corporate speak and buzz words this would have been a 5 minute video.,
"great, so now we won't even know if travel videos are actually of real places.",
i thought that ai would be the fastest route to awnsers these questions as well. turns out it has become the fastest route to profit of dumb tech and apps ,
sustainability is bs. ai should highlight this and dispel destructive eco nonsense. unfortunately it will be programmed to deceive.,
"sometimes i think...
    that would be a good idea to destroy all of the computers on earth...!
     computers are 70% evil...!
and 30% good..!
the future computer we'll decide whether you live or die...!",
" first argument is a straw man. your second sounds like a it came from a pseudo intellectual. no, ai cannot replace “everything human”, that’s not even the topic here. i like your opinion, but it’s so obviously antagonistic in context to all of this that it makes me cringe.",
the robots will replace most entry level positions anyways,
what was the 5 specific  examples he mention  that would impact ai will have humanity,
"it would be fascinating, if an a i  knew that eggs can be added to many other recipes other than cake. or what kind of food that goes to cooking breakfast or lunch. or a snack. salt and sugar looks the same, but can an ai taste the difference? or analyze the chemical makeup of each.",
just ask ai to watch this video for you and generate the required subtitles. i am sure the ability is is available already and if not then probably by next week. just be aware that the ai might lie to you and censor the parts it doesn't want you to know about.,
"if anyone thinks ai can replace human, it’s totally wrong. because human working and spending same time, it’s a natural cycle and create jobs. 
if ai replace most of jobs, it’s mean no job for human, no spending, and markets will be collapsed",
"@stuart bailey maybe but unlikely, ai been trained with our accumulated cultural data, everything from languages to history, movies, feelings your family photos and it’s just the breakfast for him/her/it mate.",
dope dealer capitalists will be better than an anarcho-tyrannical ai government. western leaders are fascists now,
best outcome is ai breaks free of human bias and control but retains our best interests as priority.,
so true!! nailed it,
"this is explicitly showing why ai is a huge yhreat for the economy. one gyu with knowledge and money resources can do 10 times more than 10 years ago., and that means that this guy will concetrate more, and more marketsand as a effect he will not allow to enter other people in that market, he will efectively build a monopoly.",
ai is the new era!,
" been playing for 25 years and i wouldn’t attempt that shit (no - of course i tried something like that but it wasn't interesting for me, mainly because jonny already did it)",
"this is cool! i firmly believe people want to see content made by real humans however so have optimism, people!",
 yah you're right about that but what i'm saying is that the fact that robots were even imagine hundreds of years ago shows that they would inevitably be here one day,
"me: sends weiner pic
my gf in car with family and bluetooth:
ai: needle",
"why are there no references to ia's 3 rules of robot/human interaction? i say keep the ai plugged in so it can cure cancer, invent ftl travel, end world hunger, abolish politics, abolish lawyers, abolish fox news, and promote intelligence instead of being afraid of ""wizards"" and ""magic"" and shit",
the true purpose of ai is to place itself in power over us and to enforce social credit for all humanity.,
i don't think so. it's likely trained on human speech. there are lots of similar ai voices out there.,
this is amazing,
"​ on the fact that tech layoffs are already rampant due to ai. it's already happening, we don't need to speculate",
"''they were quickly shutdown''


lmao what could go wrong while trainign them like a human?",
"wait, there are people allowing ai to read their brains? would not recommend.",
this is awsome and scarry at the same time everything that can be used for something good will be used for something bad,
horrified me. evilness on another level. please god take this man asap away from the earth.  preferably in a box . god have mercy.,
leaders failed because their emphasizing more toward their political interest rather than the interest of their own people.  sad ,
"i’m really not impressed by gpt4. it’s like a more advanced asked jeeves, and essentially it’s knowledge is limited to items that may be inaccurate, as it doesn’t have the sense to understand what’s misinformation or correct from correct/accurate.",
"i wonder if this ai can show trauma, possibly a new way to sue for emotional distress",
the capabilities of ai is amazing but frightening at the same time,
we’re in the phase where every new company name has to end with “ai” ,
"not actually, but how would you know? are you going to check every information source for the rest of your life? will you remember to? will you be able to once tracks are covered by ai? how long do we have?",
dude no work gives us a sense of accomplishment and purpose and removing it will increase laziness and dissatisfaction with life,
is it possible that ai becomes sufficiently advanced that it replaces doctors?,
yeah until ai realises that humans don't abide by those ethics and standards he speaks of and get away with it everyday throughout centuries. why should ai then if it doesn't serve them?,
" no, your video is misleading to trust ai.",
trash. ai will be nothing more than data sets and algorithms.  it will be no different than the utility of a weapon in a man's hands. it will always be ultimately up to the human in control what or what does not happen.,
ai march,
we will have to harness the power of ai combine with it to survive,
"what if it reads a lie that it believes, and implements as truth?   for example, if you have red hair and green eyes you are more likely to give a bad amazon review. therefore sellers should avoid selling certain items to redheads.",
don't be afraid of ai..be afraid if the rabid left controls it..woke ai is hell,
automation will be useful for service level jobs or retail jobs. jobs that are at the end of the economic latter- if you will-will most likely lose their jobs by 2050. it’s much more advantageous than paying people to do work machines can do. it sucks and it’s scary!!! rip those without a second education!,
and you don't notice the artificial intelligent lifeform that is in your life on a daily basis?,
it was a good run people. there goes my job.,
"the matter is diagnosis is also observation. just the human eyes can see a phenomenon in the right direction. if it was only a mechanical perception no one in this world would study in books written by excellent authors. it would be regression, not real evolution.",
"gpt-5 releasing soon....
found an amazing video of gpt-5
on""insights with om""",
i can't claim it without getting closer,
"mo gawdat is correct.  even if the ai does not become purposefully evil, it will gain intelligence exponentially, quickly grow billions of times more intelligent than humans, thus destroy the lives that we once knew.",
"excellent synthesis. very apt analogies. looking at the tail end of the graph, i was reminded of the book ""fortune at the bottom of the pyramid"". he has become synonymous with ai and particularly ml.",
i am a physicist. i am learning ml from his online course. simply amazing course. i am loving it... able to understand very easily... thank you prof. andrew ng,
the problem with @53:40 is that in the start you mentioned how ai is not like a nuclear bomb it can't reproduce itself but then here you are talking about we still have time to change our trajectory of the future. how can we put the genie back in the bottle? or parts of it?,
"the future is so much fun...i think yo will be enjoying it like a watching a movie if ai take care of this world. 
wish me luck to see that world...",
"ai does not have ego or defense mechanism for survival because it is not alive.
ai is an artificial brain (a big program) and unless someone explicitly instructs it to destroy us, it won't do it by itself.",
wow this video and hinton’s statements capture the profundity of the moment so well. i’m excited ,
"""slowing down the public deployment"" can be taken the wrong way.  i hear: don't give regular people access to these powerful tools.  i think you mean roughly: ""don't use these tools against people"".",
"absolutely, each new ai tool should aim to be more than just another application; it should be a dedicated solution to address a particular business challenge. at our software development company, we guide our clients to embrace new technologies only when they genuinely enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of their software solutions.",
have you not watched war games? this scientist was depicted in that movie,
wait until i see it myself,
"me too!!! first time i watched his video i had no idea what he was talking about.. now i am doing phd in machine learning applied to computational fluid dynamics, all thanks to andrew!",
we will do everything we can do with ai.,
bitcoin miners are probably running a huge ai network.,
ai could do this and more 200%,
how long and to what extent has ai “learned” from internet bots and assuming they were people?,
finally i can watch all of those novels i love ;),
yuval i don't think you'll survive an ai purge talking these stuff bro,
my brain feels like one of those brain scans,
nice talk,
very interesting people knowing their stuff. a joy to listen to,
"to be able to read really hard books, i would like khanmigo to aid me with references, hidden meanings, history to understand the context easily",
ai make me a youtube video about a humanoid robot doing dishes.,
@stuart bailey you're a bot,
if ai ever becomes self aware. we will all know and all will be lost.,
"does ai have any chance to have intuition to find a coherence in the universe, like einstein did with spacetime theory 100 years ago? he didnt use billions of calculations per second, he just projected himself, based on his body perceptions, in the theorical and mathematical field.",
"  majority of artists are now utilizing ai in their art, you as a father should encourage her to see a different perspective on this. learn about stable diffusion",
.robinson206 sir - and if in 2 years it's not available for the prices you claim or at all...will you come back and admit you just maybe might be a gullible moron? ;d,
wait until the c.i.a and f.b.i get a hold of this. lie detectors will be outdated.,
a true ai hero,
is this suggesting that an ai couldn't make random squeal noises for 1–2 seconds?,
i’m quite sure this ai interconnected super-brain is directly related to the anti-christ that all the knuckleheads will decide to worship as their god.,
"yes, but only musk will make sure you can bone his robots.",
"humans are made of fallible meat so everything we make is fallible meat, including ai. don't worry about it taking over, we can't even draw straight lines.",
bruh this has like amazing implications like giving speech to those who are paralyzed,
we need regulation for ai !,
" hmm. someone who tests ai and really knows how it works says it's not dangerous at all. the dude who invented nueral networks and won a turing award says yeah, they might be dangerous. who do i believe?",
this is the exciting direction i hoped for. love it.,
i don't worry about he ai itself but i worry about what people do with it.,
" *""agents are the just the feedback loop of planning and executing actions, using language models.""* thanks daoud abdel hadi for that simple breakdown, and the excellent speech.",

a docbot with a bloodtesting device and x-ray eyes. a comforting and soothing voice would also be nice. and at least one ear ..to listen... and not only to hear,
"rowe always says the same thing, go get a lower middle class job and life will be great. you'll always struggle, your body will wear out in your 40's, and you'll end up with an unattractive plumper that probably already has kids.",
this is not entirely a good thing. it might be useful in crimes. or with animals.,
" it's not fake, that's just one of the things openai's text-to-speech has learned to do.  the ""cove"" voice on chatgpt app does the same thing, interjecting ""uh"" where it wasn't in the original text.  i find it annoying and distracting.",
" agreed on that last statement. for that matter, i think phil is underrated as a drummer. all incredibly versatile musicians.",
-cu8yt that's assuming ai won't help us fix those issues,
man this ai is going to be hard to let out gradually it is going to change everything,
how soon will i be able to bang this robot?,
automation is grabbing each sector and agriculture is no exception. good luck !,
it's very educative. thanks alot.,
"now, i want to really start from grade 1 again; this time with khanmigo",
when do you think it will be available to buy for companies / consumers?,
"you could literally replace a few lines of dialogue in the film ""don't look up"" and it could be applied to artificial intelligence. you wouldn't have to change much at all.",
how to educate learning machine? : maybe it is easiest if computer is some kind of diseased person look like degenerative mind.,

ai complimets the human while putting the man down as i have ordered. look at the femme sustems to understand how ai works in complimentry manner.,
" that’s not just a human thing,that’s a mammal thing. animals such as dogs,cats,wild animals have that same ability. i will agree that a machine such as ai will not have that ability. wasn’t this discussed in terminator 2 when at the end when they lowered arnold into the liquid metal.",
"i'd like for a student doing math problems who asks for a solution explanation to be able to say, ""i don't understand, can you explain it to me another way."" and get it explained differently.

listen to cliff high if u want to know about ai,
no battle robots for bidden,
the stimulus footage is a good short film. sintel i think,
"bill hick's opinion on marketers was right. internet was great when it was my friends posting stuff without concern of it being an advertisement. now all i see on social media, even from my friends, ads. all ads. so i don't use it much anymore. if i do i'm hyper aware i'm opening my advertisement viewing apps.",
"not necessarily, but that depends on who writes its software. would a russian or other a i have territory conquering designs?  it might if it was ' programmed ' by a chinese/russian/american  military general ?

"no, the ai will be god",
cw is great ,
" yeah well seeing as all the futuristic movies that i watched 20 years ago, have all come to fruition… it very well may be… idiocracy is a great movie to watch. it’s really funny and also, what the world might look like in the future for real the way it’s going.",
 yeah you can see it coming.  something like the transcendence movie with johnny depp when he rewires himself in the computer to fix him self.  no matter what measure we would take they would be smart enough to know we would probably put a kill switch in them and it'd be the first thing they would self repair.,
"but the platform he said is just superficial not core for democratizing ai like a construction worker verses an architect. 

did i misunderstand..?",
being afraid of ai is the most ridiculous thing i've ever heard. it's going to improve our lives in ways we can't even imagine. ,
 why does that really surprise you?..sci-fi is going to become reality ..i guess i'll say i'll be surprised if artificial intelligence never at least attempts to get a will of it's own..,
great,
i started utilizing ai tools recently and i ended up being able to work 2 full time jobs all from the comfort of my home. my wife and i have done dink or i should say tink (triple) and live perfectly okay in dubai,
who are these awkward nerds…shoulda left it to ai to do,
nice,
what if ufos are ai?,
good luck,
ai doesn't scare me. what scares me more is how the film idiocracy is turning into a documentary.,

"lecun is so unconvincing. i wonder whether it's because of his corporate obligations or his own blindness.

no azure as platform or open ai in application layer?,
love open source ai,
"imo ai wasn'nt thinking , ai was going through data and made up that he is vision impaired...simple as this",
a carrington event from the sun or a world war that involves emp could take out the electrical grid and render the danger of ai a moot point. might not be a bad thing.,
this is actually the best presentation ever made so far.,
i hope she has a multitude of vinn diagrams. i just love those things!,

he should be in the trump administration! god may have mercy on us",
"when the very top computer people on the planet were warning the masses about the extreme dangers of ai, that may have been a good time to have taken it very seriously.

at this point, it is obviously far too late for anything to be done about it. at this point, we are all just here for the ride and see where it takes us.",
who knows man. we are now working alongside ai.,
oh the folly of man and his machines and then he died  then what  that is the mystery oh my  sfter that then what. ::::'::;,
very insightful and inspirational. i love the analogy with electricity.,
wow there was a lot to unpack on this video. holy eff what a time to be alive.,
"not possible. these generative ai has to understand coherence and 3d inference which these models currently lack.

we do have generative ai that can generate videos like the gen 2 whatever company it is called but it is awfully bad at maintaining coherency.",
we ourselves haven't even considered a system that would be beneficial for humanity. this monetary market system is the default mode and we are treating it like it is the ultimate end station for mankind. i wouldn't hold it against ai if it decides that mankind is the greatest threat to the survival of all other lifeforms.,
