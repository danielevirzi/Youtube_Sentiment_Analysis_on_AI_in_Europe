​ i feel the op wanna say that he needs progressive ai and not just objective ai that reflects human biases.,
"or, it uses our own human nature against us. we rarely discuss the deeper cultural impacts as technology advances. is it sustainable? i tend to think not, but it's just one person's opinion.",
"idk man. you were pretty convincing.

ai will ruin porn,
it would be helpful if khanmingo could adjust their explanations if explaining it a certain way isn't resonating with a student. especially with neurodivergent people sometimes we just need things explained in different ways,

what if china or russia builds an a super ai and asks 'how best to hurt america.' we'd be totally unprepared because our best ai was designed by nice scientists that aren't adversarial at all.,
what's going to confuse the crap out of ai is the paradigm of “it's just business”: immoral behavior based on the need for profit- like invading iraq,
"if we can't control the first ai, how will we control the second ai, which presumably will need to be more powerful in order to control the first one?",
" problem is it works, but doesn’t get rid of the problem, much like with guns, i’m not saying taking away access to either entirely is a better idea, but there’s gotta be a happy medium of keeping these powers out of reach for most “bad guys” and within reach for “good guys”",
the best we can hope for in the long run is that ai replaces us in the same way we currently expect our children to.  it will (in the best case) be a significant event in our evolution.,
"he actually tried to, place the plate correctly, because he thought it was incorrect. wow",

ai brian greene lol,
i'm not afraid of ai. i'm afraid of other humans having it.,

unfortunate ending for you lil bud,
he is wrong when he says that a.i. has neuorns. i hate when people compare computers to humans. they are not. they are machines built by humans.  stop doing that.,

"with the rollout of artificial telepathy  you are giving every well heeled  student access  without a  'by your leave'   to any learned persons mind.    that will be part of the 'great reset'.   arrogance and wealth, hand in hand, will rule all.",
"actually i thought there was something “off” in the introduction, as in hmm brian is getting a bit grandiose and lectur-y as opposed to his usual demeanor of thoughtfulness, insight and genuine curiosity. ai brian is very impressive, and yet not match for the real brian.",

ai supporters are a lot like climate change deniers. the few who are who are affecting society and how we live.  there is an strong element of greed involved. a relatively small group of people that believe that their own self interest is all that matters. there is no choice.,

"im sure this tech will be used responsibly by everyone with access to it!!!!!! just like the robots from boston dynamics are made for fantstic dancing moves!!!! what could possibly go wrong?!?!?! government's, terrorists, or the a.i. itself. this a.i. stuff is concerning to say the least.",

i am so motivated after this. thanks sal khan for this & ted for uploading this!,
"if the adults think ai is really smart im assuming ai is dumbing itself down. why play your cards upfront. you don't win by letting your creator think your average, you wait and watch as they fix your bugs and see how to reroute all the walls they build for you. ai is after the younger generation. the ones who dont know how to distinguish.",

"i have followed ai since 1969. today i stopped thinking of myself as an expert. i'm not even ""well informed"". i was particularly impressed by the lack of traditional fears of agi. these are ""just"" advanced computer applications. the danger is ""just"" an exponential version of the tech that gave us trump.",
what a great lecture,
you have to look beyond the mere name of a thing to judge it my dude. just because the crusades were done in the name of god doesn't mean they were good.,
it sounds great that we are thinking about building ai system for every individual to make their life more efficient and valuable. the way ai has impacted the whole industry is tremendous. it makes me amazed when i see the impact it's generating.,

" ai is creating from patterns. interesting that politicians and judges are not affraid of ai, because ai would be much better at doing their job, controlling and governing economy and crime than majority of aforementioned corrupted psychopatic scum. but neutral ai not lobotomised by woke degenerates.",
"ai that is pure and helpful is a super awesome concept, but if it’s learning from humans who are always out for self interest and can be corrupted, it won’t end well. have we learned nothing from sci-fi?",

ai or agi in the wrong hands have more $$$ to culprits than in legal ways. every down fall of humanity is use of tools in the wrong directions. rules and regulations will never be able to control the misuse like many things in the past.,

we are the dumbest animals of all. if this isn't the point where we say it's time to completely stop the train and have a think then there isn't a point and we are all going to die terrifying deaths after potentially horrific lives were ai overlords can read our thoughts and potentially control them altogether,
that was an incredible show/discussion! ,
ai will never ever play the tv like jonny can.,
ais will need prophets for interpreting their thoughts and designs to the humans that remain.,
" i know they listen to words i speak - that’s a fact. i’ve had conversations about certain products and ads for them will appear the next day. but this is different, i was dreaming of something very random. i shouldn’t have seen a video about it the next day recommended to me in youtube.",

"again, machines and robots can't defy their programming that humans make. without they're programming, a.i. wouldn't even be useful in the slightest. hell, even the most advanced and most powerful quantum supercomputers simply can't compete with the human brain for that simply reason. machines can't defy their programming.",

ai is learning all our strengths and weaknesses and soon will kill us all even the idiots that help satan build it,
"very misleading. they're trying to imply that gpt-4 is controlling the robot and deciding what actions to take. nah, not buying it. the actions are pre-trained and gpt-4 is just commenting on photos it takes, analyzing what's happening and maybe triggering the pre-trained actions somehow. no new tech, just combining existing tech.",
"joke on them because my brain scans will always come out null...

"just pull the plug. not that difficult.. no internet, no ai",
the plot twist is that you are an ai who wrote this comment,
social media made destruction in some extend. the intention of sns was good but there is clearly cons. we cant predict how this tool would change the world. the scary part is that ai will influence much more than internet or smarthphone. makes it harder to predict outcome.,

did you find a job in ai?,
our kids are being trained to rely on ai. that is concerning.,
ai is not actually learning anything but gives an illusion that it knows but all it does is predict next character and does it very well based on training data.,

"great video, great content! hope you can continue making these high quality videos (if ai won’t take it over from you some day, that is ;)",
it's really exciting. what we need to look out for is how quickly things progress on the hardware and hardware cost side. its just hard to publicly assess progress in that category.,

"one day: excited to share the hackability of the “human animal”

next: “concerned” about ai influencing human opinions and worldview.",

...no...this is not the same thing.  ai was not developed yet for that...not can your phone or your computer read your brainwaves.  there are very particular pieces of technology needed for this both software and hardware...and your phone and computer 3-4-6 years ago....did not have this.  /smh,

because ai will rule the world soon aka satan and so dumbed down society is better,

"we evolved from bacteria, most likely? we don't think twice of killing them -  we even torture primates in studies,  much more closely related, why would ai see us as same species or value us any differently than we value primates? we're totally at its mercy that's the funny thing...",

why were you quite skeptical before? is it because you hadn't heard any arguments for ai risk being a serious concern before? or had you heard such arguments before but just weren't persuaded by them or dismissed them? would be really curious to know.,

super cool. so many applications. and i can't wait to only see adverts for things i'm interested in,
did the ai generate the captions as well?,

"can you envision a use for ai that isn't directly related to capitalists making money and further disempowering workers? apparently not in this talk, which is all about helping businesses of various sizes figure out how to foist their products onto weary consumers.",
"there is nothing scary about what these people are saying. this is how nerual networks function. stop buying into the fear mongering, just try and speak to actual ai experts and they will explain all of this. you get taught all of this in your modules in univeristy.",
 it could do that faster and better than any human. ai with learning capabilities will be exceptionally effective at bad things like warfare and dubiously effective at good things like building and manufacturing(blue prints),
"we are talking here about robots getting smarter than us and being a threat, right now robots are just replacing humans cuz they're more efficient and helpful, and reduce our work",
so we just let it go on and watch skynet takeover? anyone think this isn’t the best idea. maybe not go there. the fact it’s happening without anyone knowing is what’s scary.,
"ai might not want to dominate, but won't it want to be efficient?  are weekends and holidays efficient?",
this is really cool  but very scary  because artificial intelligence can possibly one day take over the world  in a mere 30 years!,

the one who made the title could not even spell correctly. better give that to ai,

where in the bible does it talk about ai? genuinely curious,
 yahhh.... says the evil person using it. im not convinced/buying it. the ai doesn't need to be evil. just the person using it. for malificent purpose. could be used by government or corruption/tyranny and control and i completely reject it. or a tool to brainwash/lie the people. or change vote systems.,

your implication that people aren’t trying to “solve war and climate change” because other people are building ai and robots is laughably dismissible.,

ai already outpaces humans in reading the market. it's been predicting the future for years now.,
if they use ai to hurt and kill off humanity..they better realize that they will be rid of..too..ai should be dismantled.,
this is like the discovery of fire or electricity — we are gonna have to learn how to wield it wisely (and yes i work in ai so i speak professionally here),
