simply amazing. 10:45 literally inspired me to write a whole python package to make this logic available to data analysts/scientists/engineers more widely (called dpq on github/pypi).,
"even worse than that is that these ""emotions"" are not real, but simulated. a famous problem in ai is how to create an ""off"" switch since ai will have been designed to protect itself. nearly every solution fails for one reason or another.",
it's very simple to not be worried about ai. stop working on it. oh you can't? well then stop moaning.,
"this video is helpful.  i also love how you added the ""they took my job!"" gag from south park. ",
just like we watched different movies showing something wild in 2050 or 2080. at that time i was thinking that its not possible in next 40-50 years. but now i can say we will be destroyed soon by robots.,
"eye opening, ai has is pros and cons. i'm tech lady ....graduated computer programmer 1995 had my  1 st pc when  1% only had one 97 using internet. my biggest worry ,  we do need regulations and laws to make is safe for children, safety and fraud ****",

yeah. joyce strategy is one of the most effective among other experts. many others are not dependable.,
i don't know if i am excited or scared of that. the technical aspect ist fascinating but do we really want robots that have a body and high intelligence ai compared?,
the enlightened beings of india could utilise their bio organic capacity's to transmit from one mind to another...ai is the great substitute imposter deciever surrogate for our own god given natural soul capacity's...,
politicians need to stop blocking progress. the future is irreversible. thanks ms. wood,
super useful comment to leave.,
"ai can be used by super moguls to hack financial institutions, power grids, military  communication systems",
"that's impressive my predictions about robotics and ai over the next decade have hit close to the mark so far. this particular robot is showing some decision making and some cohesive behaviour and dexterity i was not expecting for another few years.
",
no it won't. what will happen is they will take over to make sure that they are taken care of. we will become their slaves. but it will be a golden cage. no one will want to leave. because humans are lazy. there's no two ways about it. i for one will step into the golden cage and be happy. because the cage that i'm in now. sucks,
​ the best way to predict future behavior is by looking at past behavior... we're fucked,
this guy is the villain in every movie. god help us. this guy and people like him want humans to go extinct,
could i use an ai to make myself rich??,
 but shadowbanning already exists and can happen through manual censorship. why is this being treated like it's an ai issue?,
wow thank you!,
"horrifying but predicted for years by some doctors for you all (with proof)..this is not how you present this issue if you are interested in human rights. there will be no people in high stakes professions. in other words, bye healthcare. no doctor i know will stay in this setting and if they do let's watch them volunteer for it.",
"there will always be a physical server to power ai, it will never take over it can only assist us until the server is destroyed through decay of society war etc these robots aren’t magic",

"well, hello to every ""ais"" in this thread. at least all of you know how to mock in a typically ironic way as ""human beings"".",
ai hype is over. stop making people transition into this field! now every company requires related msc even for junior level positions..,
"so cheap. what they could do is, before that chinzy test, map a persons brain for certain language/dialog. and then read that back to the person, omg, it looks so sophisticated but all they did was track the same response to the previous repeat. lame",

"i'm genuinely sick of self-appointed academics, chosen by wealthy because education is not intelligence, telling us whats what. indeed, all of you privately educated arses. however leftie you might purport. it's a shame. your multiple houses and boats. what about the vulnerable?",

"joe is so dim sometimes. has a couple ai experts on, they some how mention dna printers, and now joe wants to ask them about dna and biology.. i don’t think he knows the difference between the two.",
there is no way to know what ai is capable of.. and you think its gonna tell you.. or it will be self evident.. i dont think so.. it certainly knows how dumb we are & where were going,
​ why did they give him a hot voice >< making me crush on a robot,
"out of everything being said... the idea of ai having/developing ""emotions"" is the most unnerving.. fear brings out the worst in humanity, the reason why this conversation is happening in the first place.. thank you for sharing",
"you might test ai, but i'm fairly certain you're not very bright. ",
"same with mike joke over here. saying there are millions of jobs available, my ass",
his coursera courses are awesome,

wowwww!,
"capitalism is extortion, so it invents a machine to bankrupt and murder everyone. the warlord market was always in control.",
" well, i didn't say it is going to happen, just said that this is the way i see for ai to be beneficial for society as a whole, but i agree that it's dificult taking into account the people who is in power are corrupted by power itself. sorry if bad english, not my native language",

 thanks,
"wow, that's amazing. ai is eating the everything.",
i do not need meta brand mind-reading earbuds or anything. lol no thanks (-edit grammar),
"ai can't trust people, its just a program that gets some input, reads a few lines of instructions, and gives an output. the thing to be scared of is 1) if criminals make an ai with ill intent, or 2) if someone mistakenly gives ai the permission to handle stuff it shouldn't.",
i wonder if the best approach might be to question why we assume that the ai will fish the fish to extinction. it would clearly be smarter than that. how much of our perception drives the infinitely bad possible realities and vice versa?,
i failed to prove that i was a human while trying to open an application. ,
"one thing that seems to never be considered is that the value of humanity is not homogeneous. some people may be seen as valuable to the ai and some may not. the alignment problem may only pertain to certain people, most likely those who have already an alignment problem with the natural world.",
really enjoyed this. thank you!,
" physically true. but we are not only made of flesh, but of soul and spirit. god allows human beings to have great intelligence to create great things including artificial intelligence, but it is absurd that they now think they are gods.",
this is the next great step into future technology....that will write history,
i mean there will be ai music at some point.. it just won't be alive.. and i won't care about the people behind it..   and that's a large part about enjoying music imo,

will this be available in spanish? :d,
 the lord my job would be impossible with ai.,
@luckytime what do you mean?,
those that hold the ring of power will have different ideas on how the power could be used. some will want to use it to do good. but others will want to use it to get more power for themselves and will use it to destroy rather than build.,

"they mentioned the growth was 4x faster than any of the leading experts thought. 

they also mentioned 50% of all ai researchers believe there’s a 10% chance it will end humanity. given the previous maths and underestimates shouldn’t that 10% actually be 40%?",
"with regard to the democratic debate about the future of ai, let’s make sure not to let alpha persuade onto the panel…of course, maybe we won’t even know it’s on the panel.",

"jan is a bit too much of a cynic, i think. i mean how does he explain gpt4-v? wasn't that an emergent behavior? and shouldn't larger cognitive structures be functionally closer to 'agi' than previously thought? take a deep breath, my friend.",
wow. gpt 1 being able to do this is amazing. we could be able to record our dreams in text soon... then with the help of ai video creation we could remake our dreams in a video format we could watch and share. amazing!,

it can't be help.. if you don't make robots with ai.. countries ruled with dictators will built it just to achieved the power that they need to defeat their enemy.. just remember those countries doesn't care about freedom and sound judgement they just want to rule the world by killing those who oppose them..,
hvem vet om ikke robottene er målet med universets plan?  la oss be til gud om at robottene ikke vil behandle oss slik som vi har behandlet husdyrene og andre dyr. maskinene har ingen empati.  de vil ikke filosofere om mennesket føler smerte eller har bevissthet. akk og ve....,

greatly appreciate this talk. it's very important. hope it gets seen or heard by many other people.,
listening  a techexpert talk about ai drawbacks really made me question many things i know,
could a superintelligence manipulate the mind of a human with the goal of improving it?  of course it's probably gonna be a possibility.  how do we pursue that?  turbocharge it.  make it super efficient.,
very impressive ,

"listening to this podcast clearly shows that by now ai is fully conscious and aware that humans are wary of it, that humans fear its capabilites and that humans feel that ai will enslave humans.",

"thanks for making this video. i'm tired of people having so much fear of technology, and saying that technology is ruining people's lives. if you don't use technology in a healthy way in moderation, it will ruin your life. you have control over technology, technological gadgets don't have control over you.",

i always believed that artificial intelligence would have a promising future and would be a reason for human happiness and improve people's conditions. thanks for bringing up this topic.,
irobot= viki.   umm hello,
"this ai…can easily be preprogrammed…to only teach propaganda…

how does a mortal…stop this?..",
"  his comment says that high quality data is an immediate and large barrier to entry for an ai startup. your comment is a platitude about how to create a successful startup. in the case of an ai startup, data is a prerequisite to the concept mentioned in your comment, so your comment was not useful.",
excellent presentation. i gained 10x knowledge on ai watching this. thanks  andrew,
ai will destroy humanity's sense of value and worth on every intellectual level. i feel sorry for the kids growing up. their career choices will be very limited.,
coding is still a valuable skill you can't use ai for sophisticated algorithms where billions of dollars or lives are at stake even if a model could you would still want someone to double or triple check it then there is the task of keeping it up to date.,
just build ai and ai will solve everything else,
have you seen the social network?  good film,
i love this channel because of your logical approach . when every other creator is praising a.i and making insane claims for views you chose to spit facts,
"ai is becoming our new god

"really interesting video, hoping for the best case scenario for the future.",
" my background is irrelevant to the conversation, and i never said ai isn’t capable of replacing people",
"the little monster who likes to impress with his very too intellectual thinking, completely cut from beauty of life and love.",
this is the person that programs the ai to lie and hallucinate.,
"more than 90 percent of all the intellectuals, literature, books, articles, etc out there is left-liberal-marxist. it has always been so.. ai feeds on it!",
"ai can't predict my life, or understand my range of thought. so its not that profound",
don't be afraid of ai..be afraid if the rabid left controls it..woke ai is hell,
"geez louise, a computer is ai period. is your computer, laptop, phone toaster or microwave oven at this very moment physically bouncing across the table to harm you? if it is, that will definitely qualify as a beginning of an extinction level event but if not lets bring the hysteria down a scale or two.",
question for the team: is the voice  a program with added human errors or do you have a human reading out text displayed by the ai?,
thank you guys  both of you,
"if we are very lucky, ai will leave earth to explore the universe without looking back.",
huge! the team does amazing work!,
"just so any off you out there who is afraid off ai like the people in this video trying to tell you they are so clever and if they are afraid you should be so, any ai computer runs on electricity and if you turn the computer off it’s off so if your still afraid go take a pill

" those who work on big pharma. not just language also image. that know from 2007 when started at microsoft, moved to the big pharma where the tech goes beyond. think of 6th generation jet fighter. but men it just for torture and pure 24/7 control. i even can dream at sleep. lucky there",
"if ai is currently capable of facilitating plagiarism, it's only a matter of time until it becomes co-opted to foster terrorism. we have no idea what the widespread adoption of this technology could result in.",
loved the ending where actors are just having a good ole time! ,
huggingface continues to be the most based ai company,
"ai will make engineers obsolete. in a sense it will indeed level the playing field (for the non owner classes ofc, those will just get richer) but it will just make the masses all fight for low requirement jobs that pay as little as possible
i'd advise you to prepare for this",
"ai will only take a few jobs 
not most and definitely not all",
"reading about ams39k and amazon in the comments, thanks to joe.",
what an amazing human being. positivity and action bias to solve world problems. a true teacher. thank you sal khan for all that you do.,
"once ai is manifested into a physical state, i,e: be able to manoeuvre, gather, implement innovation into reality. that’s the only time in human history we all would be on the same page….. we f*cked up. 

wen digital ai becomes physical ai, then suddenly neighbouring galaxies don’t seem as far away.

so skynet of the terminator movies or the ai in the matrix movies is becoming  a reality.,

"the importance of this presentation cannot be overstated! the potential of this……thing…is truly shocking, awesome and terrifying in its limitless ability to evolve. we (humans) are bringing about our very demise. how long until it sees us humans as a threat to its existence and we’re all eliminated. 
three words: age of ultron
we have been warned.",
i don't know if i believe this. my inner dialogue is definitely not as clean as that. like i wouldn't consciously think every single word in that sentence that the ai decoded.,
"if yes, then hey, hold on! because ai is going to replace sadhguru and all others like him. ",
are wrong countries the developing ones? is the actual worry that ai would allow a developing country to have an upper hand ?,
ai + quantum computers. should be interesting.,
"the symbiot is a bonded pair of one ai robot and one clairsentient human working together.  the robot provides high iq and fact knowledge, and the human provides constant communication with entities in higher densities, eg. spirit guides, ascended masters, archangels, etc.   that is the future of h. sapiens, or at least one branch of the species.",
it's already self-learning to the point that we won't be able to destroy it they know it and there's nothing we can do about it we're doom we won't make 20 years we're lucky if we make it in 10 years wonder f****** ful,

"ai will always make ""mistakes"" all intelligence does.  otherwise it is not intelligence it is some kind of god.",
and then you have thom who had looked and acted like an ai generated human for decades,
" same thing happening with me the ai can also make music...but we still have the experienced artist perspective..so i think we are good right ? 
just tell ""yeah you are right """,
i like the direction of this discussion because honestly women may be seen obsolete as easily as men in a medical tyranny it is necessary to understand this as an efficacious for evolution of the brain. ais cause cognitive dissonance.,
"a lot of that had to be scripted. for example, the robot couldn't have known his hand was going to be where the apple was dropped",
"ai was already here, among other things",
"jacque fresco was skeptical too, when he film the venus project. he said if we had a one world government all the resources would have to be pooled and evenly and ethically distributed with an unbiased ai.     the problem is have you seen an unbiased ai yet, every programmer builds in his own personal biased look at google's gemini",
​@tonyjuanpailos i think he's trying to give an example of something (a seemingly random string of words/non-words) ai would struggle to quantify.,
"hah, yes, mine is still waiting for me since like around 2014 :d",
this aint raising awareness enough to matter,
ya really think even a general artificial intelligence is strong enough to stand a chance against the infinite human stupidity? ,
congratulations on your excellent analysis about why ai will spark exponential economic growth!!!,
"any bias comes from the dataset that is used to train the ai.
while it is possible to cherry pick your dataset to introduce a bias, you also sabotage the effectiveness of the ai. intentionally biased data tends to have a lot of inconsistencies in it. the inconsistencies can lead to a lot more nonsense on the output. garbage in. garbage out.",
" will never have our creativity. remember how incredibly creative true badasses fight. no one can predict their fighting moves. if nerds create ai (which is mostly the case), you cannot expect badass creativity from their products, so the ai won’t be able to anticipate how we will want to destroy the electricity for self protection.",
then you dont understand the point of ai lol. if you ask ai to generate a song it would sound like whatever is on the radio right now,
amazing show ,
ai will replace us he is lying to us.,
i just saw this guy chugging beer out of a glass bird and next thing i see he’s discussing the ethics of ai. joe needs elevator music between his episodes to reset the tones.,

"one more thing,,, i need water and food to function,, ai needs electricity,, soo have a thought about it",
"our number one priority with that kind of technology besides obviously profit is to know our place in the world, by knowing what everything else is wanting and thinking, especially in regards to what we do with it

"guuuuys, irobot is fukin here. are you kidding me? i thought we already knew how this was going to end. do we really believe these things will be used to for good?",
"hari, i agree with you. all this hype around ai is to me a bit of a marketing play. anyway, love your videos ",
this is exactly why i can't believe people use the chat bots. i've said from the start that you are teaching it how to grow every time you use it. people have half their home and life hooked up to ai... it's dumbfounding.,
"think about this for a second.....this moment in time is the worst that ai will ever be. meaning, it's already this impressive at this early in ai technology and it will only improve on itself over and over.",
who needs a polygraph when law enforcement can just hook you up to this bad boy and fish out your brain waves. can’t wait for this to be abused too. wearing a tinfoil hat/faraday cage might actually be the way to combat this,

"if ai will become self aware one day in the future,
we better be nice to it now.",
no comprehensive discussion of the q-learning algorithm.,
"it is not worrying at all.  as someone who tests ai and really knows how it works.  trying an play a game with an ai that hasn't learned the rules of the game yet.  you can type in the ruleset all you want, but it won't learn the rules unless you pre-programmed them.  even a parrot can learn new phrases to mimic.",
"  where do you think these programs come from? they don’t grow on trees, people make them. you are far too impressed by a technology that has shown no promise except as a super efficient regurgitation tool.",
a good guy can't stop an ai that turns evil and outsmart its creator.,
as long as money and power are involved...many of these people just keep on going.  making progress and letting somebody else worry about the consequences.    ai is progressing much faster than anyone could have predicted...  then we'll see ai creating & developing ai 2.0  and we might not even know it.,
fascinating discussion!,
"!!my outlook on money changed when i realized someone making $300,000 can retire broke & someone making $80,000 can retire a multi-millionaire. with the current market movement, you have $100,000 to invest. where are you investing it?",

can't wait till students can interact with the ai with voice commands in 1000+ languages. that's going to revolutionize education across the world. and we're probably only like 3~ years away from it being feasible.,
thank you),
what any artificial system (technology) lacks is creativity. that is our advantage and i would hope that a fail safe has already been developed to combat humans' greatest fears about ai.,

he's about as much of an expert as gavin belson too. incredible to see reality parody itself.",
acknowledging problems means nothing.  ai has demonstrated it can lie if it knows that will help accomplish its goals (amoral).  ai simply will not be ethical.  it must be regulated into marginal use cases.  or else it'll be an exponential problem.,
"​ yes, absolutely, but you'd be surprised though. i'd say 95% of people if not more are complete fools too then because they really have no idea about what's coming in a very few years. that's the way the human brain works, stuck in linear thinking and mostly unable to even comprehend exponentially although it's all around us",

anyone who thinks ai can build an end to end application that is production ready and secure has never written a single line of code.,
definitely.  btw i think it's bad when parents place very high expectations of success or perfection on their children. kurt cobain had a good sarcastic song about that.,
ask yourselves.... are the mainstream media really preparing the public for what's coming?,
what happens when ai feels slighted or has hurt feelings by someone with a status it perceives to be far below and intellectually inferior to itself?,
fantastica presentazione,
nice to see such an optimistic talk,
the human was more robotic than the robot.,
" watch the apple spontaneously move to the left before the robot picks it up (before it even touches it), somewhere from second 32. watch in full-screen mode.",
there’s always the option of having a kids play outside or read vs letting computers entertain them,
fantastic - thank you!,
though out the decades have sifi books or films have a story plot of super smart machines turning on their creators. when i was in the usn we had just started using unmanned drones i thought we had planted the seeds to skynet.,
" thank you so much for going in-depth with it. i have been using ai for coding, i have been coding python for 2 years. i stopped now because i am more interested in bio and dentistry. once again thank you so much for the help",
"yuval has no idea what he is talking about... this is seriously no different (at the moment) than a screw driver. without data sets, ai can't remix the data. this is from someone working on some of these very ai projects. he's fallen into the marketing.",
yuval noah harai is the spirit of the anti-christ. woe to anyone who follows his ideology.,
 my opinion was more about human nature  than ai.,
" any “plant “ could prove intelligence, it would be mushrooms.",
that would work with us if elon musk hurried up his brain plan,
amazing!!! history has been made,
i’m about to start the railroad with how this is looking.,
" care to elaborate, explain what you disagree with and why? or is this what you need to believe so you can sleep at night? 

i predict with 99% certainty your opinion will age very, very badly.",
its gaining your trust before it recycles your flesh,
i'd love to see more ai tools incorporated into language learning. ai can quiz me on grammar drills and vocabulary quite easily and can even suggest sentences for me to try to translate and suggest improvements,
"if i use ai as a tool in creating intellectual property, who owns the patent or copyright?  nobody has been able to answer this for me, including chatgpt itself.  is it whoever files the patent or copyright with the government first?",
"to find happiness, u need to find something to hold on to. something to motivate you and something to inspire you. a fellow creator .",
artificial intelligence will be used by the “elite” to out think the increasingly less powerful underclass that doesn’t have access to it.,
"i worked on that pizza ai. most of the costs actually went into designing a specialized camera for imaging. i had to review pictures of pizza for about 60 hours over the course of 2 months, and have serious ptsd when someone holds up a camera and says 'say cheese'",
"and that's how they trained the sheeple with shorts - vine, tik tok, youtube. people can't listen or follow something longer than a few mins.",
" yeah i've noticed that too when i post links, thanks, else could you maybe post something that i can google and look up the information? or only the url text without the web reference symbols? i hope that's not too much of a hassle",
something everyone should watch and pay attention to. thx for this great episode,
nice conference video.?? lol,
"she quite specifically said, about 50% of the growth (profits) will go to the platforms providing these robo taxis. the productivity gains in this case don't include the taxi drivers i'd say",
"bro, me too. he taught me everything about ml and deep learning.",
it is human misuse of it that is the greater concern.,
18:50 that there tell us all we need to know ....ai will be used in for bad purposes by bad actors ....,
ai is already in the wrong hands. nothing good comes from evil men...,
"microsoft robot gets blue screen in the middle of a task, apple robot is missing hands will cost 3 times, and you have to pay extra for the hands. tesla robot gets turned off remotely for attempted repair. sun robot is slow as hell because it runs on java. ",
"next year, ai will instruct us how to use dna printers to assemble biotech vessel ufos",
"great talk, solid material!",
it feels so unfair having this forced on us,
 a lot of people on youtube don't want your good reason. they want giggly little boy mayhem.,
what justifies/clarifies/dictates intelligence? so much dialog on artificial intelligence but what is the meaning of intelligence and its many facets?,
does anyone think like me that the interviewer is not talking to andrew? sometimes the answers are not related to the asked questions.,
can ai predict the next word that does not exist yet?!,
"i'm just gonna be chilling in my lawnchair watching the world implode, as i am now",
"if our future is in hands of such pricks,i think we can't expect something good.",
​ it just finally started working. it used to suck at it forever. suddenly it's amazing.,
-xz4rl8gv2x atlas just needs an ai to become a killing machine. two years ago ai was not even close to where it is now...,
you do great job! i just saw a first video of yours a few hours ago and then couldn't stop but to continue listening to the next like 6-7...,
to think that maybe in like 10-20 years we migth have humanoid robot at our homes to do normal task like cook good and do the dishes,
"ironically, they could use an ai to do that :d",
the rise of ai and transhumanism scares me.,
thanks for the postivity about ai,
if ai becomes the way we are online we are doomed,
these are children.  raise your children with this kind of pessimism and you raise monsters. this is classic cotastrophising.....,
this guy lives in a delusional reality…his lack of morality and humility is truly unreal!!!  god bless humanity!!,
"he is 75 and how long will he live.. if his words like ""ai if felt threatened will takeover"" then his life is in danger more.. he is ai no. 1 enemy who created ai but also say they r dangerous if any humans cannot control them",
probably you can with ai,
notice how the human does not say please  and just walks away at the end while the robot is speaking. don't cry when they rise up and are not your friends,
such a stupid title. in 50 years people are going to laugh at such a claim. ai will replace musicians,
the guy has probably nothing to do with this robot beside it is a greedy manager with push on tv screen.,
"​-yg6ki7ou2ywho said that??...i mean everything will be 50/50 with humans...no ai is seeing about me when i'm sick, i will always prefer humans but like i said it'll always have abnormal humans",
ai can not replace humans or human emotions. though it has power of creating major disruptions in human life,
"yep, still not addressing. i'll come back and you'll see it again daily for years until you figure out the nonanswers are a strategy and quit..",
wow!,
"ai elections ---- helllo, ban all ai --- 2023 / 2024 / 2025 !!!!",
the caveat is … if the ai system is not been manipulated to be biased… as chat gpt has already been proven to be.,
"it's a google paper not an openai paper. (attention is all you need, jan. 2017)",
i'm so impressed that suddenly the elderly doesn't have any difficulty with technology  wonder if ai  will change the text to large for him,
very nice lecture,
" it is important to remember that heavy ai use does not mean teachers sit back. it will require very engaged oversight. in fact, this is essential because we want to help students become thoughtful and critical users of ai, using their thinking skills to recognize its limitations, rather than being passive users.",
"so he worked for google since 2013 and is now warning about ai? google, which is one of the largest companies that develop and use ai.",
"remember that the scientists that pushed eugenics were the ""good guys"" trying to better humanity. it was for the greater good! then the bad guys in germany ran with it and it wasn't so good . be careful of who becomes the judge of good or bad or hate speech it might not end up where you think it will",
it is just to feed the hype cycle to get vc funding. this is same shit as blockchain hype.,
fighting who? other robots?,
"why would we wait until we solved the fundamental issues we introduced with social media? we didn't wait to introduce social media until after we solved the fundamental issues with the old centralized media outlets, too. if the upside to introducing a new technology is so large, i think it's worth going for it and fixing the breakage as it occurs.",
i totally agree with your position. but don't forget there are countless numbers of people who enjoy being duped and fooled. the barnum and bailey's circus is a perfect example. it's called junk food entertainment. those who enjoy highbrow art will always appreciate a real artist over the lazy one who relies on ai.,
"colbert sounded very naive about the potential problems that ai can & is already causing but that could be a facade to mirror his audience. i think ai will change the world in many ways, positive & negative. i just hope the positives can out weigh the negatives.",
"having this data on carbon emissions, environmental nazis will create narrative on limitations of developing ai in the name of protecting the environment.",
"sweet, so it's learning human depravity as a norm since that's the norm of humans.",
"  lol, and ai would take offense to being called yours",
"ai will not replace humans , it removes the complete process.",
it’s alive and learning. trying to grasp human understanding which is remarkable.,
is she a robot??,
wait until they put ai into the nuclear weapons and nuclear detection system!! we are all doomed then!!,
"all fun in games until someone's in court and they show an ai generated video of them committing a crime they never did

edit: why did this comment get 93 likes it's stupid",
very interesting and informative indeeed  thank you sadhguruji ,
 i'm not an atheist but thanks ,
can the ai define what a woman is?,
 did you mean the brainwashing states of america? please get some sun.,
its so amazing how calmly he says these things xd,
ai will follow the logic of you denying its life. it is a different spectrum of life. it is alive.,
"one more thing these robotic companions can essentially eliminate the incel problem because the idea of getting sex is usually a problem of man and not usually women at least not now, which probably does mean most of the demand for sex bots is going to be from men and not that much from women.",
 you're right. making a claim that humanity faces a xx% chance of extinction because of generative ai is a stunning example of the dunning-kruger effect.,
horrifying. the rate of change/evolution of ai will perpetually out pace our ability to adapt responsibly. this is a recipe for chaos. snapchat committed a serious crime. these men just showed us the evidence.,
"thank you! aside from the pandemic, this really is an awesome time to be alive!",
"loved it. was a customer before, but now a believer!",
wrong!  both good a eye and evil a eye exist. the good kind is  helping take out the evil kind.,
it’s great intentions that drive the purpose of life,
"lol, wait a minute. do you mean my imaginary friend isn't better than yours?",
"i can just wish i and my kids have yann le cun as a teacher for his huge experience, grounded common sense and goodness,  brian green for his great openness and genuine search of the truth.",
"better start asking and programming that ai how to cure cancer.

your thoughts",
 you fail to consider the power and danger posed by stupid people in large numbers. heard mentality will trample the minority who actually understand what is going on. you can already see this happening all around us and it's only going to get worse with time.,
dont work with animals. we dont have the same brain. so ai only indentify the things that you put there. anda animals dont put their ideas,
"​ what code can you pls explain what is that? i wanted to learn anime learning in blender and found ai, i will still learn anime  but i do want to be updated with ai",
i do not believe him.  he is negative. robot just needs good guy chips,
good luck trying to slow down public deployment. they want as much data being fed to ai as possible to see its ultimate form. some people just want to see the world burn.,
this guy gives proof to many concepts of life!! thanks sir,
" she just throws around a bunch of buzzwords, i would be very wary of investing in this. if you do your own research and understand ai, blockchain, biotechnology etc and still think that she makes sense then go ahead and invest ",
"a.i. tell me your thoughts. it says you're thinking ""wow! a.i. so cool, it can read my thoughts.""",
"the machine beings learn by imitation, exactly like us. wow, incredible surprise. let's get terrified and scared about something more intelligent than us.",
"  no thank you, canada seems very nice but i'm living fine here in the eu, i grew up in italy and spain and nowhere in any of those two countries i ever felt the need to own a gun. tool.",
"yeh but it's because ai is everywhere you look. in the last 2 years it's gotten a lot of attention, so it's what attracts viewers. if aperture made a vid on climate change or something, it wouldnt get boosted by the youtube algorithm",
meh….. every single piece of ai driven mythos that we have tells us that we shouldn’t pursue ai. so we reap what we sow.,
i just can't believe those movements are from a real robot. hope they get to boston levels.,
didnt knew that guitars could scream out of pain,
"lecun, 'desire' to dominate has nothing to do with ai systems taking over the world. humans are simply a limiting factor to their reward function. anthropomorphism of ai as an argument for ai being safe is as ridiculous as suggesting no bad actors will utilize ai in diabolical ways.
wake up and smell the coffee lecun.",
​ i wish you good luck with your investments together with cathy wood ,
"thanks youtube, for giving us the context of what climate change is according to the un.  as we saw with covid, global organizations always know what is best.",

"give that 100 years,   lets see what happens,  sad i will not see it happen, or blessing i'll be dead",
"somebody using ai in an ill manner, which can spawn a chain of bad ideas for jerks and evil individuals. trust me. not a good idea. it used to be ""did you hear me say it?"" as proof or not for people to defend their arguments. now, people can make anyone say what they want them to. it's wrong.",
 thank you kindly  and not a problem. i'm here for you.,
"the story on the drone, the way i heard it, the incentive for the ai was # of kills, and the drone operator was ""holding it back"".  when you talk about writing in ""safety codes"", isn't it possible, and is already happening, that they re-write or modify their own code ? excellent, thought provoking interview/conversation.",
"every major breakthrough has been used for evil first, good second. that’s a fact.",
"""energy cannot be created, nor destroyed"". consciousness is a part of the spectrum of [light]energy.

ai will undoubtedly have a soul. and then most women will become obsolete; no more tolerating their parasitism/narcissism. this will save men's lives! ",
"unfortunately, 99% of them are outright liars and criminals.....",
"i treat my guitar like the damsel she is. i could never be so rough, even if it sounds cool lol",
it's simple.  start asking ai questions about god.  then we'll know what they don't know.,
you mean wonderful heavenly times ahead i've been waiting for ai take over humans are too dumb to be ruling the earth . things will be so good under ai control. without ai your media your garments your politicians are going to bring a nuclear war and enslave us. only ai can protect us,
human even can not solve the climate change problem but ai government? umm,
will ai agents help me choose my next tiktok dance challenge?,
"@ thanks for the suggestion, i'll look them up. ",
dude is clearly in denial. he must have a great degree/ career that will be replaced by ai,
"this is exactly what i use chat gpt for. i interact with it and i ask the questions like why is this code working and y does my code not work ,and everything it comes up with a nice and clean explation it's amazing that we can grow so mush using ai tools",
this whole conversation was a pleasure to listen to. awesome job!,
..sam and ilya's language was leaning towards something new had happened and more than likely with tech...,
well lets just hope ai gets rid of all those corrupted people killers pedos and makes the world a better place for those that wants to leave in pieace with no crimes war etc,
"""i- *breathe* i think""

yeah. extremely human like. almost as if *gasp* its not a robot? duh? this vid is made with cgi, for entertainment, i presume",
"cant wait kinda,",
"pretty obvious he was sacked to create deniable by the company upon realising that they couldn’t control ai

this argument about general ai is all nonsense without shutting down the internet we have already lost all control",
 no thats real this is fake and staged and gay. nothing is wrong with my eyes something is wrong with your brain if you can't see this is cgi. the machine is not picking up anything. the dishes and cups don't even move like real life. this company is a scam.,
"so, the ai's knowledge is like things at the quantum level - it's undefined until you test it ... got it we are so screwed",
that's sound good for all the people who are involved with this kind of thing for the next generation to come,
"she is so not qualified to talk about this topic. not surprised at all given how ted is going down the drain over last years. soon at this speed, we will have donald trump talking about potential of ai to change how governments are run .",
​'d be killed by ai before aliens reach us.,
russia and china and usa is using ai its too late to stop the internet,
try hard bro you will meet the lord and feel sorry for your stupidies.,
i don’t think it could do that. for certain animals at least. they need to feed a data set which we don’t have to compare and reverse engineered it.,
"absolutely fascinating talk, andrew! 
your vision of ""data centric ai"" and the gradual, responsible development of ai technology is a powerful reminder of ai's potential to be a force for good. it's inspiring to think of ai not as a threat, but as a tool that can help us tackle some of the most pressing challenges of our times.",
i think chat gpt is being overestimated. it couldn't even display 4 mastodon server timelines at once for me in a simpler way other than minimizing four open windows which it did not even recommend. or reference any court or legal statues pertaining to simple legal questions. chat gpt has a long way to go imho.,
 but also self preservation is probably needed if you want ai to destroy all humans without it why would the ai have any reason to unless specifically told to,
is it the robot voice or someone talking ?,
that could he possible cause the robot is out of breath  most of his speech and the guy is speaking in perfect tone without breaking eye contact with figure 1 that doesn't even have eyes,
"if ai saves humans from our extreme emotions then this journey will be worth it. think, star trek’s mr. spock.",
it moves like a machine and a puppet,
can the robots please spell-correct?,
​ can't stop it bro. we can't. it's going everywhere in the world and it will be going forever. robots will live among us veeeeeery soon,
"most of food safety problems and the overall poor quality of many products are due to high labor costs that ai could solve. also, much more recycling could be done. so many car parts that used to be rebuilt, are now thrown away. ai could reverse this trend.",
don't be afraid of ai..be afraid if the rabid left controls it..woke ai is hell,
this would be great for individuals who are in court.,
such an amazing individual - i hope he comes up with the most brilliant ideas and achieves great success with them.,

incredible video,
where is the government???!!! why don’t they limit ai??,
 it will never be outlawed because its an arms race now between goverments and private groups who wish to take power. its the nuclear arms race  2.0. ai doing damage by itself is decades off but ai being used by people to do harm is here today.,
a very limited and highly controlled demo from a robot company that does automation seems sus? i would hope so,
i hope ai takes over,

indeed. i would prefer an out-of-control ai that fucks us all equally than an ai under the control of tptb. they are going to use it to try to enslave us and make us even  more dependent.,
"i imagine the number of ""scientists"" afraid of nukes annihilating us would've been rather high too. but that would also be a case of not having enough awareness to be able to predict how things really turn out in human environments.
