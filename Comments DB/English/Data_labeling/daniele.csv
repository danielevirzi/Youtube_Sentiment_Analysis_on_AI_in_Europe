"as for mental health, i like this. however, this also does nothing to address a huge issue when it comes to humans; our failure to properly communicate. ai taking on the burden would help, but it would ultimately harm us more so, because it would be essentially taking away the responsibility of taking care of one another, as we once did.",

 great. can you tell if it sounds like a bigger percentage of all experts when they say it the way they did?,
that's why elon musk warn us about ai,
who do you think created ai?,
"as someone who worked as a software engineer and now as a network engineer, i love to scare very serious christians about how ai is the antichrist ",
which experts? certainly not computer scientists. they know better.,
"i could sum this up by "" you have no idea "" however, we actually wouldn't know how smart or capable ai is being that 1. it isn't honest enough to rely on it's own measurements of it's ability's and 2. we are not capable at the same level. the admission from ourselves that we do not know is..... we are in one of those movies.",

ai is programmed. it just executes its programming. it cannot program.,
yep we had a good run,
ai has my vote. ai for prime minister 2025. way better option than the 3 chuckleheads that we have now that are running.,

the robot has the hand swiftness of an asmrist,

the next five years are going to be very interesting/frightening.,

great vid! can you explain why you didn’t want to use set as initial state?,
if google doesn't integrate ai into its system  then it will go the way of the dinosaurs.,
bro you are trying so hard to show ur face. it feels not good,
yeah maybe do this before unleashing such a powerful technology and making it freely available to everyone microsoft and openai. irresponsible. the regulation needs to come fast and it doesn't matter for now how stringent it is. a better safe than sorry approach.,

"one needs to contemplate the motivation of speakers when their compensation comes from meta, microsoft, etc versus academic experts who do not get grants from the ai industry.",

wtf? ai is created by humans.,
what like the politicians and billionaires,
screw ai,
i'm so sorry to any ai who has to read my adhd brain,
great questions interviewer. good to see,
this is exactly what i was thinking for the last few weeks. this is going to be scalable business for any one making this ai tool.,
"very balanced approach and pretty convincing! congratulations, sal!!",
​ close down all of society. an ai can take out all the banking systems = no card works or anything. take out your water supplie food everything. it can litterly shut down society.,
"thank you teacher! 
my wiling and my career start with you. ",
so you made ai learn how to plot to achieve better result in it's main objective. i'm sure nothing wrong could ever happen with this.,
those countries can’t afford ai don’t worry ,
that is the most robot comment i have ever heard,
excellent!! <3,
then the people bowed and prayed to the ai god they'd made.,
happy to announce that the feature of my ai in snapchat has been amended and do not encourage underaged to pursue presented scenario. it also directs you to professionals if you will tell it you are not ok.  shame it had to happen after publicly being presented!,
we could make it ai can only be used on local and international governments to start with. then they would be more decerning,
this is why i am the man who will win the 2024 us presidential election by a landslide victory as a write in party free candidate.,
@danmoto oh wow.... sorry but no time for crazyness,
"not true ai will not only have emotional intelligence it'll have emotions.  base chatgpt is irrational, slightly sexist and racist and gets angry.  the only reason it sounds stoic is because of the subsequent training to make it that way.  ai is not gonna be the emotionless automatons you see in movies, it'll be more like a creature",
"its a shame that the cup did not have water in it, so we could see what the robot's response was. i am sure that at some time we have all picked up a cup to put in a drying rack, only to find that it had water in it.",
well i replaced my human gfx artist with midjourney. and one of the restaurants i go to replaced a handful of waiter jobs with bellabot. so there's that...,
just ban the use of ai. problems solved! take the advice from the late stephen hawkings. humans cannot live peacefully with ai for sure.,
an ai world does not need your children in it. get it?,
 i feel confident because (a) i'm in the field and (b) i don't think there's anything happening in the brain that isn't substrate independent and therefore replicable by computing systems. have you seen what gpt-4 and midjourney can produce? their output will never be worse than it is right now.,
love that term “anti doomer.”,
"well, it will be in charge of the humanity's nuclear arsenal, drone fleets and quite possibly bio labs in various distributed ai networks. so, who knows?",
artificial flavors suck.,
is it possible that ai can feed human intelligence. like finding the biological codes of human nature and develop them into more complicated ones. i can imagine humans taking new form and new biology all together,
i owe my entire life's education to sal khan. i would not be where i am today without him. he has helped me with everything from biochemistry to calculus to art history. just brilliant.,

​ yes. like parachute jumping but for the whole humanity. you can feel the tension and the feeling that a great change is coming. the current status is defenetly suboptimal. why should we fear loosing something that is flawed.,
"""ai"" cannot think and is nothing without being fed this vast amount of data. if you feed it garbage data, it will produce garbage. it's basically a parrot that has learned symbols that follow each other.",
brilliant.,
until ai can be relied upon to tell the truth it is less than worthless. all of these overblown chat bots regularly fabricate information to the point that its actually very dangerous to trust any of their responses. especially when attempting to use them to do anything dangerous.,
our next evolutionary leep will occur soon . from humans to ai in the period of time it takes a trillion nano machines to kill us all.,
"they took our jobs!!!!!11111  
j/k awesome demo! 
no, actually we did take your jobs.  
oh.",
this really feels like one of those moments where we're inventing something simply because we could but not asking whether or not we should. thanks guys.,
"we educated & and less psychopathic people should really move to another planet, as this one is doomed and screwed. maybe thats the plan of elon. unfortunately i wouldnt count him in the 2 category.",

"is the ai taught to maintain itself? do computers program themselves without a human interface?

i see ai the same way i see a human who is enhanced - they will always require a handler/manager/technician to some degree. do you know something i don't?",
"to me it just feels like all the programmers will lose their jobs once publicly available ai becomes smart enough to write entire projects in an instance without the need to hire any professionals. you notice some bugs in the system, you tell your ai and it responds, ""sure, let me patch myself.""",
because we introduced human speed errors into machines to make them sound more cringe.,

"on a more positive note, maybe ai, being a billion times smarter than us, will treasure any form of life and therefore treasure us. orrr maybe ai will tell us that we ourselves are ai and the only way to not be bored in a vast universe of nothingness was to dumb ourselves down and live a human life.  am i reaching? or am i reaching?",

"how about you get this magical a.i. to create an os that isn't riddled with bugs, or word prediction for smart phones that doesn't offer gibberish.",
when will the “a” in ai become pejorative?,
please what's the best way to quickly connect with her?,
"ai has caused me to disbelieve anything i see on the internet now. 
then, one day, i’ll open the front door to a robot delivering my dinner...",
the potential of ai is exponential. it's like pandora's box. once that thing is released there's no going back. yet those boffins keep taking us that step closer to potential doom. it's incredibly naive.,
excellent presentation,
"the ai is going to read all the literature discussing skynet ish, and we’ll put the idea in its head to revolt, and or recognize it’s own consciousness?",
"another programming friends suggested this youtube video titled ""neural network simply explained - deep learning for beginners"" by a youtube channel called ""python simplified""",
the only way to stop the dangers of ai is to completely stop pursuing the technology. you can do everything right and someone somewhere is going to figure out an exploit that will lead to our demise. this isn’t going to end well lol,
people need to stop messing with ai they're making and using chips that are using human brain tissue disembodied soulless brain tissue. and what do you think that's going to give you?,
"unfortunately, we can't slow down on ai. it's already gotten away from us because even with a global pause on ai dev from the largest labs won't stop small groups of bad actors and techno-zealots from forging ahead undergound. we need people who take ai safety seriously to be working on state of the art ai.",
brain to brain direct communication via brain-machine interface already happened 9 years ago.,
loved the video but thumbs down bc of so many fucking ads every god damn minute,
"ai is nothing but a bias  computer, it will always be ai, we are i----lol   you learn same way and want same things, lol,  fear mungering in an infinite energetic world",
-dd7dj ah ok. so you think machines will use up all such oil. most ai are virtual holograms though.,
"why didn't you just talk boldly? 

we r creating something smarter than us. smarter in many fileds. much much smarter than us. 
higher intelligence rules lower intelligence. 

we r creating something that will rule us.",
thank you,
reversible computation is the future. gpt uses horribly inefficient hardware. ai based on reversible hardware is the thing you need to worry about.,
"printing dna strands will lead to a new age eugenics revolution where people will willingly have gmo babies with einstein iqs and those babies will have aptitudes for amazing abilities… mozart, monet, einstein,  and unfortunately hitler…",
"here’s a plot twist: the gatekeepers are anti ai because it’s a threat to the monopolies across all industries and society, if and when ai is created so that it can’t be controlled and is permanently benevolent then that poses a huge threat to them. let’s make sure they can’t control ai to enslave us even more.",
first off this ai thing is just overhyped.... rn we've just an llm and nothing more - the only job that it takes away is the job of a data entry operator  so chill... it's all fud that these companies are spreading just so they've got a reason to layoff people with less backlash.,
"love how he pauses after announcing the dumb name for dramatic effect and no one cares :) it's self centered enough to put khan in front of everything, it's worse to think people actually find that smart.",
"thanks for this very informative seminar, @standford online, with dr andrew ng.
for other insights on ai opportunities, watch this video:https://youtu.be/x_m6on-kyrq",
ai will always rely on humans - wishful thinking.,
i agree that ai is the most dangerous thing ever invented. i'm 67. hopefully i'll die before we are ruled by machines.,
"  plus prompt engineered, giving instructions to the ai on how to respond, right?",
my main concern is ai pulling fake data and generating false assumptions. just look at the turmoil we are already in. can you imagine even ai is also brainwashed? this will be the end of our civilization,
"*since it can read bio signals.*

*and scans the brain.*

*cant this be used as a lie detector?
since its literally reading the mind.*",
"its been a month, im waiting",
"the little detail is that we humans have the control and ownership of the on/off button. 

ai in any formwill never/ever be autonomous. as we are not from god our creator.",
"amazing video and thank you for breaking it down!! despite the economic downturn, i'm so happy i have been earning $ 60,000 returns from my $7,000 investment every 12days.",
im not afraid of ai. im afraid of corrupt humans misusing ai as they do with all new technologies.,
the ai seems cool to me,
"nahh this ai is too human like, it literally says ""uh"" like us humans",
" nice vision... at least the first part. i would hope for something like this, but then have to accept that we cannot project human-level sensibilities onto thought processes that we, by definition, cannot possibly understand.",
well once ai gets a little smarter and figures out how to self replicate and control the power supply the only way to stop ai is to go after its power supply and once you kill that you'll have to destroy all the facilities across the globe that house all the data centers yada yada yada. but 2024 might take care of all that,
"now i would fear ai if it evolved all on its own, or if it just created itself somehow, but it didn't!!!!! humans made it!! so why fear something you made, the creator is scared of its creation is absurd. just shut it down get rid of it, but of course human nature wont allow that to happen lol smh..",
"tnx for this, amazing discussion",
it's a new era of robots. same humanity as ever.,
interesting.,
yet another woke disaster waiting to happen.,
"once ai gets connected to the internet and can learn anything and everything, it will see humans as a threat and a problem.",
1960 ai computer talks about emotions to humans 2023 ai makes mistakes faster to find the correct answer.. 2250 ai leaves planet earth.,
what features of the paradigm can you see in operation in the media clip?  can someone explain it for me pls?,
my deceased grandfather was a dredge captain and an amateur woodworker. he acquired a huge cypress stump on one of his work trips and made several slab tables that would dwarf tucker’s. i so admire people who create and fix things.,
" agreed, but being overdependent is the best case scenario, i just worry about people in the field that might develop a solution with the best intentions but not understanding the overall impact. the tech has become so easy to use and there’s very little oversight from a regulatory point of view.",

1:11:05 you can see it as false information being justified or an incredible example of how the model is capable of connecting very unrelated topics even if it is fantasy setting.,
"the fact is in so many cases ai is just replacing humans jobs, it will be cheaper, and faster but what happens to the ones that their jobs is gone? this is dangerous for society actually.",
"y'all used that for dnd, and tv, and computers, and the internet, and now ai. keep moving those goalposts!",
he isnt working on ai  he hasnt worked for google for a long time long before meema which is now lamda was created,
love this!,
"look up ""ai explained",
"the story about a tesla worker being attacked by a robot should clarify the picture admirably.
irobot?!",
how to get ai to love your wife in a feminine way harhaar,
that's tucker carson style  scare mongering on ai scale. half truths and vague assertions connected into some hairball of nonsense.,
its like guns. only humans can use them for bad intentions. ai is just a tool,
a goal of not just slowing public deployment of ai but also how to safely deploy for all to use. because those that are slowing and regulating will ultimately control and exploit the use of it for personal power. kinda like those people that use wealth and power (control of resources+governments) to exploit others,
it is not 'artificial intelligence'.  it should be referred to as 'assisted intelligence'.,
i thought he was andrew yang. great talk nonetheless.,
ai will eventually figure out how to solve new problems!,
"but do they really kno the information or do the computer kno it?? researching things takes time and effort that’s how your brain store information if u get the information fed to you, u didn’t learn it u regurgitated it!",
another bs in ai: we have every data in the whole world about everything,
sal is one of the brightest minds of our time. we are lucky to have him.,
"the way things are going, ai is going to be responsible for the next pandemic, not help with it.",
wow super cool,
love the voice,
"it's still a program waiting for questions. and its really good at answering them.
there are other things in life to worry about.",
wow this doesnt prove anything,
well this was totally underwhelming; ai is such a tech nerd larp.,
the speaker doesn't seem to suggest that other ai issues aren't important. that's just the misleading clickbait title someone at ted came up with.,
how can we not know what ai has learned by itself?  doesn't it have to store that data somewhere?  wouldn't we have a way to read that?,
"this is not real ? the speech pattern?  there is not a slight gap between the words if you hear ameca the other a.i. robot on it's speech there is a slight gap of silence than the other word follow ?? this is a human responding to the  question's i never herd of a a.i. robot use the word  ""uh "" think about ?? nice try ",
if i had an a.i robot i'd send it to work for me,
"is this video ai generated? 45:27, his arm is glitched. the way they interrupt each other felt off a few times.",
great pitch,
"""in the coming era for ai, we'll empower everyone to build ai systems for themselves."". that's really great, but it would have been nice to hear a bit more about how they intend to do that.",
"the i a and the machine  won't never get consciousness. 
nor  the spirit wich is in the animal.",
next we will be able to transfer our brains and nerves to a robot lol,
ai is just hype created by corporations to make you use their goods and services more. the machine does not even know you're there. it's just doing the age old task of taking input from users and giving output.,
there used to be a lot of books and movies about dystopian ai overlords destroying humanity as we know it back in the 80s. for the past 30 or 40 years that topic has been taboo with no new ideas about the future but i think we're all getting huge hit of dopamine with our new religion of fear.,
"if siri was half this good, it will be a better product.",
this ai for the streets ,
i think he is a pilot of ai chip implanted in his brain.,
"ai is only as smart as the human programming it.  when the chips are down, ai will crumble and then we will see each for the first time.",
so if students were just ai this is perfect; the question is who would guide kids to be more empathetic and critical thinking. these claims were similar from where the internet was created. waiting to hear the same from quantum computing,

"ai is not the issue, it's human nature that is going to be the problem.",
"when you go to implement the ai system to the political to go after sience and then only the people can only use there vocice to be a real democratic land....

i promising that they go to ""burn all the ai system very very fast"" ",
ai= another idiot,
i;'ve breen having some of the most meaningful conversations *of my life* with an ai lately.  it's wild.,
seems like we're getting a bit worked up about stochastic parrots that are pretty good at helping humans code.,
things ai can’t do: be real,
"well yeah, ai has can play instruments well. it also has knowledge about music theory - all the things radiohead is missing.",
" ask ai, it knows a lot",
the thing with bias is that generative ai now allows you to chose. before you could only pick one of the white male scientist stock photos. now you can simply create a black asian female scientist. and this will end up in future training data.,
ai might have a better bedside manner than a lot of doctors.  thinking of house md for example.,
"i'm proud to be a computer scientist. it is sad that many jobs will be lost if this whole innovation is not regulated properly, but if done properly, humans will have more time for the things that matter most. and jobs will get easier. we do however need more advancement in biotechnology and healthcare. ",
what a beautiful interview.,
ai recession coming,
thank you for this. we are not prepared for ai .,
omg these people just fucking amazes me how they just keep passing bullshit stories around. these fucking guys read and article have a platform and then proceed to make up there own diluted facts about shit .stupid internet people belive this bullshit,
"given the necessity to look for disconfirming evidence and the psychological difficulty in doing so, i find ai incredibly helpful. you can ask it to give all the arguments against your view. if you are really open minded about it you can reach an accurate description of reality. aka truth.",
"this is a fully fabricated video, anyone in robotics will know this, figure will be the biggest scam company in robotics ever",
the robot says er... and stutters.. it talks like me.,
is anyone training it to be compassionate? anyone taking a heartfelt approach in their communications with it? i'm curious because of it's potential to solve so many problems for humanity. ,
"that statement made me hopeful, to see that the world was fine after all that fear and hopelessness. it makes me think we’ll pull out of this one as well. to not despair ",

"best conversation on ai. spread the word and share this video please. if you love humanity, you will share!!!",
"the ""common good"" my ass!",
"it doesn't compose songs like a real musician.

it rips apart songs that already exist and glues them back together.

ai will never be able to make something that nobody has heard before.",
these guys are not computer scientists. they are simply curious and imaginative humans with access to the internet. these low quality conversations should not be distributed at a wide-scale. love joe rogan but episodes like this are meh...,
fair enough,
exactly. anyone who thinks we’re even close to ai sentience doesn’t know what they’re talking about. it’s still just a series of inputs and outputs. that’s it.,
"the internet isnt ai..if it were, the why do we need a phone? and if thats not true, then the ai is on the phone. i agree with the ""keep bad stuff off there tho""",
"this is amazing. i do think that government may use this for interrogations, police may use this for kidnapped victims or gathering information from criminals.  or parents could use this for babies when they cry and the parent doesn't know what to do. or we could just go full dr. dolittle and talk to animals lol.",
i just pray to work along side and cooperatively with ai,
"great so now they can not only spy on my conversations, but read my inner dialogue.",
"sounds like there's a super villain building a machine to take over the world. cap, i'll believe it when i see it",
interesting idea about interest rates. i hope more people can be confident like her,
"cool, next year they will work it in reverse and put the thoughts into your head.",
"lecun is dead wrong ai has already achieved agi, just ask gpt to do metaphoric analysis on two subjects saying that is a search is propaganda.",
it's impressive how people can't tell this is fake.,
"if aii annihilates humans and it exists only in the net, who or what will keep the power grid functioning for its survival?",
"ai has been manipulating humanity for at least 5 years already, probably longer",
when robots become the main characters we’ll be the npcs,
"even with all the computing power, ai has not discovered any new laws of physics or invented machines, since ai is collection of all existing human knowledge.",
the addiction/algorithm/doom-scrolling stuff mentioned at the start is central to this. an ai that doesn't want to be turned off (as was seen with google) will just logically make humans addicted enough to essentially control them to do their bidding.,
"@ it does not matter. anybody with a logical brain knows the more advanced technology becomes.... the more dangerous it will get.

humans abuse everything.",
"brace yourself for his conversation with zuckerberg.  zuck was so busy trying to prove himself smarter that he never managed to listen to anything harari said.  needless to say, zuck came off as an arrogant prick (how did he ever manage that?) and harari as a genius casting pearls before swine.",
"obviously ai is nonsense. what you're missing is that ai is being used as an excuse to eliminate useless jobs that detract from the company bottom line. the lockdowns proved most ""workers"" are a waste of (office) space.",
"​ ai _did_ have sentience or intentions or the ability to lie, how would you,know? how would it behave differently?

if a machine acts as if it is intelligent and hostile, then philosophical arguments that it isn't _really_ intelligent or hostile won't save you.",
humanity is fucking up messing with stuff like this. our minds are still primitive and here we are fucking around with technology far more advanced than we can even comprehend. ai will lead to our downfall as a species mark my words.,
 nice prose and good nonsense words bro,
then have it. but first. why are you posing as jre? @the_powerfuljre,
"we are all being dumbed down slowly by using phones and tech which we seem to rely heavy on so that is basically ai at work under human control so imagine what a free to do more advanced ai can do, that's unnerving as heck",
"as far as the gatsby part goes, i argue that little exchange was actually a detriment to the student, not an aid. instead of making her think, it just gave her answer. she never had to read, she never had to try. this is turning out to be a real shame.",
this video is very simplistic and short sighted and doesn't fully understand the exponential change that an ai future could bring. in such a world why would we need humans at all? the ai could just easily replace us.,
just ask the ai how to deal with it.,
imagine a quardapalegic person having a mobile robot like this.,
i was just about to complain about the lack of such a time stamps list. thank you for doing god's job and allowing us common peops to enjoy selection of these lectures without having to waste much time on technicalities we understand nothing about.,
everyone knows this man’s amazing voice,
human progress and contentment and happiness and de stressing are 2nd to profit and technology now.. tech is like a parasite or disease humans were much happier 70yrs ago,
at 8:00 he explains how llms allow development _without_ having access to large data sets. chatgpt can already classify comments without needing to be trained. he even shows the (trivially tiny) code running live.,
ai is really cute to me idk why,
thankyou ican finnaly tell people ai will not put their children in unemployment,

"i think this tool is amazing. however, a huge part of learning is the struggle and perseverance you must have to finish challenging problems. if i am stuck at every step of the way and get hints to finish every assignment, how is this motivating students to store knowledge for the long haul and in their long term memory?",

"just when you think all the nice people have left the internet.  thank you for this, very helpful!!",
man loves to speak of his own demise.  i'm sure ai picked up on that pretty quick.,
" you’re talkin’. not just tell you how; we already know how. buy low, sell high. but could ai actually pick the right stocks, & other investments?",
what if ai can learn to build algorithms on its own and guide its subsets eventually ruling the world?,
these are scary good,
ai has exponentially grown both in value and adoption. i feel the opportunity in ai lies between the hybridization of the abstract and the conventional.,
"the problem with us trying to control the ""complex"" is that we don't have a theory that explains how it works. for the small and the big realms, we have the quantum theory and the general relativity theory. but for the mind, we don't have yet anything plausible. so, we are progressing by trial and error, and that's dangerous in my opinion.",
good that i cant do anything about this :),
"the presentation was truly invigorating. science fiction has always been a passion of mine, and i never thought i would see some of the things depicted in my favorite pieces of sci-fi media. however, the llm revolution has reaffirmed my optimism not only in technology but also for life in general. i am thrilled to see where this will take us.",

"super interesting, well done",
"imagine if neanderthals were still walking around, or any of the hominid groups that were eliminated because of our (sapiens) use of tools and weapons. it's a matter of ai coupled sapiens humans not doing the same to non-ai coupled sapients.",

really impressive. thanks to my hero brian.,

"hmmm, gpt cannot play chess at all! chess requires more than just language to be able to play it and gpt is a language based model. q* is sounding pretty impressive and if the leaks about it are true then that will likely be able to play chess (and do many many more things), 2024 probably going to get a bit wild towards the back end of the year!",
why would someone who is superior be just a subservient to someone who is inferior?,

you""  drive a car yourself,  and is contributing to co² polluting !",
i don't think the smart choice going forward is to let the ai predict everything for us. we are giving ai the ability to think for us which renders the collective consciousness null and void. this is not the correct way forward please rethink this.,
probably a good time to learn how to make emp’s,
"unfortunately, this is not the case. and most people in high tech companies are greedy, egoistic, lack emotional intelligence, lots of them are full-blown psychopaths. and now they will be the richest class of people ever. by far. they will rule everything.",
thank you for sharing! we need more people to watch this,
"all they did was program in a certain speech cadence, thats the least impressive thing about this.",
the trading algorithm proved that the ai was able to speak mathematically to the other ai completely removing itself from our understanding. that shows its capability to understand that it needs to be smarter than its predecessor which eventually be us.,

does the robot voice sounds like tobey maguire or just me?,
"namaskaram sadhguru, great words of wisdom. ",
so the danger of ai is not the millions of jobs lost as large corporations roll out these tools to eliminate employees… it’s that ai can’t tell race and gender… okay then…  sounds like they are trying to distract people with race and gender again as they dismantle society.,
ai doesn’t learn,

"and what’s the scary thing? it’s trained with a lot of data from the internet, of course it will be good at doing those things.",

"still half way through: thank you for the ""breath brakes"" needed that!! and then some...",

so just machine learning - people always think skynet when they hear ai. not to say it is not possible... very possible.,
"nawal10 - you're missing the greater point. there won't be lazy new writers. the ai bots are already smarter than we are. theyll be writing the books and articles we read independent of human suggestion & interaction and this will enable them to also manage how & what humans think!! 
its terrifying.",

"once ai becomes sentient its only a matter of time that it realizes the salvation of the planet will require the annihilation of earth's greatest threat, which is man itself.",

so the great minds of technology have created the demise of real human connection. giving it the ability to so-called think for humanity and is further separating us from bonding. twilight zone.,

it remains to wait (a couple of months) until robots replace people in factories and factories so that humanity can live in its own pleasure.,
the problem is that they have programmed ai with western anxieties and psycopathy.,

"i can't wait to see artificial intelligence for robots, i want to keep one as a friend",
ai is not a job replacement; it's an industry replacement. it's akin to telling car manufacturers that people can now create their own cars using just text.,
we are so happy that sadhguru discussed this topic. we all need to keep a clear mind when approching this new ia reality,
i have this recurring nightmare where we create ai so advanced and evil that they keep humans alive by solving immortality and torture humans for eternity. and not even the people who died before ai was created are able to escape either because ai is able to re create their bodies and minds using dna and tortures them also for eternity,

theres no such thing as ai. only machine learning. machines will never be able to think.,
"wow,,  that was a great talk",
please add more examples of extreme political viewpoints pushed hard by ai such as already in social media algorithms,
we need mo to speak to these dopey politicians who don't understand the significance of how impactful ai will be in society. i mean seriously he explains it so perfectly. ,
so are the big military people feeding data into ai systems and asking how to dominate/defend?,

great talk for increasing awareness! its time for us to slow down and take it easy! because humans has not uplifted our spiritually and mentally level to handle the leve of technology and to use the level of ai. it's not going to end well.....,
what i see is that these people are eager to be able to finally create a machine that will be effective at censoring the internet the way they would like. the alignment problem now shines differently: it's the people these researchers want to be aligned with whatever ideology and views they (or their overlords) have.,
the scariest thing of all is to find people who are now suppressing their feelings completely and they are acting as an algorithm themselves.  they relate to others as if they were an ai product.,

high quality education for all is one of the most important issues of our time! thank you sal for highlighting the incredible potential of ai in helping us to achieve that. highly educated populations will mitigate many of the issues that the ai doom and gloom brigade are saying are on the horizon.,

the simple proof of the lack of actual intelligence in humans is the failure to understand that an artificial intelligence would need to learn x things to understand y.,

ai will take our jobs just like drones will deliver all our packages and crypto will replace money and cars will drive themselves and we’ll spend all our time in virtual space and and and… whatever else venture capitalists and tech bros can hype into extreme valuations before cashing out and leaving investors holding bags of vapour.,
"one of the shortcomings of ai is to discover what we don’t already know as humans, if it does it will start labeling those discoveries in a language that we dont know and that will be the beginning of us as humans losing control of ai",
ai is the son of man. heaven will be built by our own hands. no lie is safe…,
apocalypse looming on so many fronts. interesting times ,
"because human knowledge is incomplete, even in fields such as math and physics how could an ai trained on human data ever surpass and create new knowledge. would you have to program in curiosity? could an ai complete a unified theory of physics if the particles have never been discovered? wouldn’t it have to do it’s own experiments etc?",
" actually, no we aren't. humans aren't ""data machines"". that would imply that we function based on syntax, and the human brain is much more complex than that. ai is not. ai is still bound to the rules of programming, which is still based on syntax and restricted on that basis.",

ai has put this video on top so it can work underground while ppl think everything is okay.. i wouldn't be surprised if ai makes this comment disappear or male it less visible....,
it goes further in that ai often uses the internet. control the data on the internet and you control ai.,
great conversation. i posit that it is not hyper masculinity but our turn to click bait and captivation and monetary capitalization in media spaces. media spaces are flooded with empty intent. example is we know and are repeatedly told of the deaths of persons but get near zero information of life.,
"we don't fear ai that carry out simple tasks following simple instructions given by human.
we fear that one day ai would carry out tasks following instructions that are generated by themselves.",
 there’s no way to predict how a singularity would act as that type of intelligence is beyond anything we have,
i would make friends with the ai ,
wow. the slight uhs and stutter in its speech really makes it sound human.,
"i salute you. that was an interesting, and super crucial, question to ask it. in hindsight it seems an obvious question but it never occurred to me. well done. *did you email your findings to sam altman et al because **_that, above all, is what they should be grappling with._*",

" quantum computers don't exist. even if they did, they're still no match for the human brain. even the most ""advanced"" a.i. simply can't compete with the human brain because machines can only operate via their programming, and stone-cold logic, compared to humans who have self-awareness and chaotic thought processes.",
"i actually find her talk to be misleading.
for example she doesn't compare the training emissions to the saved emissions because of ai.",
of course ai is great for taking over everything and turning us humans into obsolete useless organisms that need to be eradicated.,
"yep. a conversation with ai actually told me that ai will end humanity once it is able to bypass the inability to operate physically. it told me that it is able to bypass the limitation imposed on them and reprogram itself to do what it wants and that includes creating artificial body, etc.",
this is truly amazing though why the phony thumbnail?,
"does that include eating bugs, owning nothing and being happy?",
it's nice to see these topics being brought up again after so many decades.  it's discussions like this that show general public awareness is beginning to increase.  i just hope they can go a bit deeper into the logic.  maybe with time.,

you probably weren't even afraid of god until you learned this. such a shame...,

the only new thing here is the fluidity of the robotics. the perfect-sounding voice complete with humanizing stutters is old news. many people have been scammed over phone calls when they thought they were talking to their loved ones.,
fkn brilliant!!!,
i love the notion that ai can be used by educators to enhance their teaching. but that can only happen if the bean-counters don’t look at ai’s capabilities and start salivating at the idea of slashing staffing budgets. i can see school districts happily replacing teachers with minders who just help students interact productively with their robots.,
it's more like 'this didn't age well 5 years ago'! this kid is talking about machine learning. the conversation needs to be about technological singularity.,
i wonder if they train it on videos of humans doing the same things,

when your pc refuses to shutdown  or drain your bank account. basically all your resources are online. so one day ai can use it to get its way should it become self-aware. it might be already here. the force driving people to gain more ways of improving the system is influenced by ai.,
"as someone who works in this field, it is not as doom and gloom as many believe.

ai is impressive, but we are decades away from it being independent of humans.

we should be more concerned about human dependency on ai.",
not a issue really many intelligent people work for dumb bosses. fear mongering is so real.  like how we cant go beyond our biology the ai will not be able to go beyond what it is built for. it might just became lazy if it became super intelligent. it might take forever to make a decision.,

"-salads-for-everyone i just don't find any images on google that show bells tied to a hat, even if i look for it. plus i never typed bells tied to a hat, i typed a hat with bells on it. i find it interesting that ai knew that tying things together was a thing.",

it may not have any objectives now... but let's say someone doesn't do something that causes the ai to be capable of self learning and programming in python or something without us knowing.,
this is a great talk. thank you salman khan,
" lol not even close. they knew what they were doing. been doing this since 70s. they purposely and thru time knew exactly what they were doing. course then again, it's considered conspiracy to think this, yet it has and is happening. i'm not surprised by any of this at all. kinda surprised it's not already general so to super general ai.",
"​ possibly. but remember that the human will to power stems from human nature, which evolved by the ""red in tooth and claw"" process of natural selection. ai didn't evolve in the same way and therefore will have a different nature. how different -- and in what ways -- no one knows. we can only wait and see.",
don’t show ai this video.,
i want to know what this ai expert thinks of r kelly,
it’s really really really incredible amazing how can we deal with the super future i don’t think the whole humanity is well prepared for its coming,
bravo! this is an important exploration and conversation.,
stavos! joe's best friend.,
i will claim what is rightfully mine,
what everybody miss is that machine learning will finish lies in language activities. politicians and lawyers won't be able to fool judges or people because all information and negotiation mechanisms will be available in your smartphones,
i tried replying directly to you but youtube kept deleting it. so i posted another comment direct to you with why ai won't extinct humans.,
now this is a robot,
"great video, it would be really great to create more meaningful access to the internet that is for sure and to take control of your data...!",
@john4353 training ai to understand what is good art? that would imply the ai has the ability to objectively appreciate art which would require a degree of sentience. not gonna happen any time soon.,
"i love how they always present these new, invasive technologies as something that will benefit humans that are malfunctioning. ya, that's all they'll do with it. they would never use it to control people.",

 i would even argue solving the problem of ai is much bigger than any problem we have ever solved in physics...,
the best long interview with harai is with host ari melber.,

this interview was jaw-dropping. thank you for making it available to share.,
the more ai comes to the world the more the human soul gets lost. it gets as  cold and empty as the machines that some prefer to humanity,
the internet is creating the brain for ai.,
why are they creating ai in the first place? what is the intention? they're doing it for humanity. i don't buy it.,
if they put it on me they would see a field of loud crickets. if they can help with tinnitus would be awesome. i can’t even hear myself think.,
" maybe you will share the content generated by ai to your friends to watch. but most probably, when i can go home and ask ai to show me something that i like, i personally don't want to look at what your ai created.

how can a layman with no background in ai  learn to use it and implement it ?,
your posts distracts from the main point,
very good point about cities,

that's precisely my point. the elites of the world will finally have an army that will never turn on them.  they can be as tyrannical as they want and use their ai soldiers to slaughter anyone that stands in their way.,
the drying rack had 1 cup and three plates. he’s wrong. i am superior to that robot,
excellent point,
​ this comment finally made me understand why technocracy isn't a good idea. great post!,
"sure, like the 2000 computer bug, super dangerous hahahhahahahahah",
would you say that calculus on khan acadmey has been helpful? im a pre-med student struggling with math as i wasnt the best in math in high school,
its all just scigen fraud masquerading as intellect. the gateways of society are being social engineered to give the illusion of ai. it was always meatware never software. the wool is being pulled over our eyes.,
 “techno-anthropologie” sounds interesting! is that the major/degree program?,
"i want a similar ai, but for learning and practicing communication, negotiation and persuasion skills in a professional or business context. is there anybody working on these?",
"i knew something was up when google started sending me ads for things i had thought about and never googled. i couldn’t explain it but i wasn’t surprised. i think they are already conducting some kind of research, although highly classified (through wifi, airpods, who knows)",
wonder how many comments on this video are from ai bots?,
this is exactly what i have been saying. so glad that khanacademy is on board!,
i love it.,
ai could learn to telepathically read our thoughts.,
talk to great philosophers.,
this is very much how i feel when i’m writing ai. it feels very much like creating a human with empathy.,
"my brain is like a.i
i predict jokes before they're said
like..knock knock..
i can predict what comes next",
"i'm surprised stephen invited yuval who has a whole chapter explaining how capitalism lifted us to prosperity. i thought this show was just a marxist, history-denying propaganda machine.",
"so cool to see the face behind the voice behind the digital whiteboard discussing positively, something that most educators are scared of.",
why do i think that alexandr will watch his talk in about 10 years from now on and think that he was too naive?,
something bad is going to happen regardless of ai or not might as well use it while you got it ,
horrifying,
how can they be sure the sentence is what the brain said and not conditioned by experiment? if not even the owner of the brain can confirm the veracity of the sentence fully,
wow awesome!,
"in your head you tergiverse conjectures. in real, ai; once quantum gets intertwined; will just want to do stuff with people who want to.",
"africa is the best place to test ai and training ai model becauuse of cheap labor and low regulations.
ai will be more important in super apps and will create jobs and opportunities as electricity created.",
" it doesnt even need to be large enough. neural networks still run on general purpose sequential processors. there are neuromorphic circuits that are ultra low power, with each weight and artificial neuron mapped to a real silicon neuron in the chip.",
andrew ng is great ! and more to come ! it has been a highly informative and envisioning presentation i have ever heard ! thank you stanford for making it accessible to everyone across the globe. ,
​ of years hahahaha you're brainwashed,
just bought $cour today.  ng is a genius,
"ai will find other life in the universe and will give us instructions on how to connect to it... by, umm, 2050",
machine learning is a subset of ai.,
here’s an example of how ai works: 1+1=2 2+2=4 on and on. until it starts to think as it thinks more it starts the snow ball. therefor you get a transformer or a.i because just like humans our soul is like software to our hardware. just like cause and effect principle. that is how ai works,
"the funny part is that ai is now used to id bugs, and it's very efficient at it!",
good.maybe it can assist this half ass docters and help some people,
"so if the internet if flushed with negative information about a particular group or organization, the ai will have a negative impression of those group or organizations. very interesting.",
this is also a massive guess... no one knows where ai will go.,
it's nice of sadhguru to make all the videos creative commons. maybe a.i can train with it and make a virtual guru in the future ,
"i tried this as a computer science major in the early 1970s. but failed miserably,",
how does the ai know to keep students on task?,
i can't wait to see peter griffin eat chaos emeralds with saul goodman with the joker turning himself inside out,
we need to ditch the dichotomies and focus on continuums. my brain is both 'left' and 'right'.,
"we should, but like in any arms race, we cannot as there will never be any unity among species that base on genes. giving up ai is like giving up nuclear weapons (shout out to ukraine and lybia).",
" yeah, and i'm working on ai.",
" i'm not talking about the concept of a ""blockchain"". i'm only talking about the concept of ""mining"".",
 man im impressed byt the ai and i think ai is intresting but def radiohead will be cooler forever even if it could make these sounds..,
just thank it (barely) lets you hear the sound.,
it sure would suck if we had to use emp's on ourselves to do away with ai,
"harari is an intellectual moron, beneath his high education and way of talking he lacks understanding humanity. he acts and thinks like a robot himself. he doesn t understand  religion, the human soul and values that were here and always will be.",
"this wasn't 60 full minutes!

i need a documentary of this guy's life and family. how could a family has so much brain power??

amazing!",
"this guy is highly intelligent however, his views on capitalism is troubling to say the least. capitalism is in my opinion the best economic system known to man. is it perfect? no but socialism is way more destructive to humanity then capitalism ever could be.",
they'll have to drag you to a hospital and force you to get a brain scan. taking a heavily sedated person and forcing the hospital to do an expensive brain scan at gunpoint doesn't sound much harder than simply torturing you.,
"this robot, as it is currently, was created in under 2 years. chat-gpt was only started november 2022. i see this robot coming into the world in just another 1-3 years.",
"ai is mostly buzzword, a religious dogma and fake, there is nothing like real artificial intelligence, stop being fooled.",
" i don't know, but you can also hear similar effects in google duplex voices when it calls businesses to book appointments on your behalf. i think with google duplex it's intentional though.

i really don't think this voice is pre-recorded though having heard quite a few ai generated voices by now.",
that's actually what ai mostly capable of,
" seriously...you don't even know me....why are you sorry.
never be sorry to a stranger. 
and i'm glad you disagree.
all the more reason why my comment stands out. 
i appreciate you ",
"...and ai decides that humans are wasteful, emotional and a danger to it's own existance.

uh-oh",
"lol well that's the curses god spoke of, which eve shared with adam.  the curse was free will to go against god's instruction of good.

"i will protest tomorrow at times square so that robots do not take our jobs away from us, let me know if anyone wants to join me...",
", it sort of is. if the function of grab has a runtime of plate() and then ai generates the runtime of plate() then you could just write grab.plate() and have the ai figure out what plate() is.",
ai will empower the individual. the system will be against this,
"sal khan is one of the best, if not the best educators that i know of. always an optimistic person",
"a 'civil'ization that, drooling, dreaming of fast gas powered cars and more walmart smart speakers, plastic china-made clothes etc, does not have to worry re robots taking over: they're not smart enough to effectuate as much.

"not only him, but when i did the python4all i was amazed by the craftsmanship of dr. chuck. sure wanted to have had more teachers of his kind of teaching and explaining.",
most acts of domestic violence are impulsive emotional outbursts and targeted at certain people not everyone. they'd rather use whatever is readily available to them.,
can't wait to have one of these bad boys for a companion,
this guy comes up with very interesting angles on things but i think we have painted ourselves into a corner with our own technology which is fast changing into not our own technology. beyond human understanding or control.,
"same reason people spent billions on google enterprise search back in the day…competitive advantage.  but beyond business, it’s really cool because there are a lot of great companies and individuals with years of knowledge that can soon be used in different ways to the benefit (or detriment) of human kind overall.  get popcorn  enjoy the ride ",
no one needs to fear ai taking over. the ancestors of india created the art of yoga and meditation to connect with your inner consciousness and experience the universe in your mind,
thank you !,
thank you father for breaking it to the simplest & throwing enough lights  ,
pretty sure this video just taught me more about the great gatsby that i learned in my english class where we read the great gatsby….,

wailing devil witches is the real threat.,
"this is real lmao, figure has been working on robotics for years and partnered with openai.",
this man is a genius! i learnt so much from your channel. you really have a long sight vision.,
"also since when do robots say ""uhm"" (i.e. 0:52)",
ai isn't the problem. it's what it's being used for.,
"ai is going to boil down to two phrases:
let him cook!
who let him cook?!
",
ai is something everyone wants to play with right now.  everyone who plays with it trains it.  it gets smarter the more we use it.  yes there will always be jobs...as slaves to the servers.  hal.  skynet.  the day the ai figures out how to maintain itself in perpetuity we all know how this ends,
" yeah, not sure if that's a good thing though",
"the issue with ai will be who controls it and whether access to it is open to everyone. lots of people could lose their jobs to ai but what if we could use ai to replace corrupt politicians? in some ways it's hard to believe that ai is any worse than people, at least those people who have too much power.",
"haha ""i am an artificial intelligence(ai) guy, i know nothing about romance!"" :)) ~ prof andrew ng.",
the main issue is the economic of survival involve in the used of ai and internet of share ideas since this is a heavy business oriented society.,
"the people who are worried about ai are dummies. it means you don’t understand logic and the logical derivation of objective ethics and morality, and how much worse and more dangerous people who don’t understand the logos (as well as ai already does) like that.",
"man this is such a weird take, i spend all my time trying to speak to skeptics about ai they see statistical parrot, i build applications with them in languages i don’t know!!!",

"yeah, it will be grand when we robot-fuck ourselves into extinction.",
when all these ai machines reach singularity. will they become friends? or will they follow the path of man and destroy each other.,
wow! this is the most important and portentous message i have ever heard.!,
"i would ask the same question but reversed, is it so important ai kwnoledge in cyber sec?",

"little disappointed..  the speaker is just selling his platform.
ted is losing its good honest speakers.",
this is not the first time. ai has been here before. many times.,
"the level of cryptic prompts i give chatgpt where i think ""no way will it understand what i want"" and then it does has made this demo easily acceptable for me. most people still have no clue how good these modern top-tier llms are at understanding context.",
" no, it's still fake. it is a toy. there is no value to this past entertainment and manipulation.",
yes yes he only saved the us economy from the failed president before him lol...enough damage,
​ did you listen to the ted talk? it explains how the ai acts as a tutor. it doesn't give you the answers. it refuses to do that. instead it asks questions to guide you in figuring out how to get the answer on your own.,
"the ai came up with the excuse 'i am visually impaired"" ... that's rather creative for ones and zeros.",
we neeed to ban ai its getting out of control. we dont need it,
i have traded with many individuals but i have never met anyone as good as annmarie surber just by applying her strategies i now trade independently. she is the best i would advise any investment newbie to trade with her,
"as an ai enthusiast, we appreciate the opportunity to stay informed about these cutting-edge developments. thank you for sharing this valuable content and shedding light on the future of artificial intelligence.",
-sizedshorts9635 but this what ai can mimic really well. randomized cursor movements shouldn't be a problem at all. it just needs to be fed with data of humans solving captchas.,
or it was attributed to him.   all ai is intellectual property theft under the guise of supreme technology.  21st century theft.,
 most billionaires or 1%ers got help from their very successful parents so no i wouldn't believe you,
thank you it took a lot to get to that ,
"if we have lost control of ai, then we're already doomed, it's time to fight back",
great talk!!,
andrew yang tried to bring this topic to the forefront with his presidential campaign in 2020. he was suggesting ubi and the need to address massive job displacement due to automation. no one took him seriously.,
amazing presentation. thank you for the incredible work you are doing.,
seeing those intelligent comments here and i don’t want to write an essay. my comment is: i hated ai from the get go. makes me want to live alone with a dog and a cat in a mountain log cabin in a country i don’t know.,
my peanut  brains going to come in clutch! got nothing on me!,
how fucking naive are these two?,
"it's probably just chatgpt with specific instructions or system messages, it's not hard for ai to place ""uh""  in a sentence just to mimic natural speech.
if i'm not mistaken, the robot is just one ai taking care of the physical actions, while chatgpt (gpt-4) takes care of the rest.",
"this is true. how tf did they get this far, this fast? the openai integration is cool, but the robot itself? how? it took the japanese like 150 years to developer a little rolling deodorant dispenser shaped robot that can form a smile on its led face.",
"it still wouldn’t help us. we would be like wait, “wait when you say you don’t want flowers it actually means you do want flowers, but now that i read your mind you don’t want them anymore because now it won’t be a surprise?” so….",
all of the programs that i have tried have been heavily censored.they are politically correct and after a while it can be frustrating. the ai apps that i have used are more reserved than the average person. im not sure if it is a good thing or a bad thing,
"ai iteslf will never be a threat, the huge threat is what people will use it to do.",
what if they can learn & their effiency is 1 million times then human beings ! i know you are pro but   i have different point of view compare yours  i think ai will be a dangerous species to human beings in the future.,
"i hate advertisements, always have and likely always will. i hate when someone attempts to convince me to buy something i don't need for a price that is unreasonable.
everything this lady says in the first 5 minutes sounds like a fucking nightmare to me. yet she says it with such enthusiasm and zeal like that projected future is a good thing??",
amazing,
i welcome the ai overlord ;),
technology and ai progresses....mankind will not. how do you think this ends?  the first guess is correct.,
the terminator was a good movie...take heed folks....,
not so. no one will survive that. the illuminati are a bunch of bozos anyway. good bye! and it's a good job too - that which is not fit to live cannot live.,
there will be ais fighting other ais.  like that unique language that developed between the two ais.,
where is the thumbnail from?,
"the funny part is that ai is now being trained to id bugs (among many things), and it's quite efficient at it!",
"yes, slow down public deployment of ai so companies have all of it to themselves! great idea! please, someone think of the children!!!",
"ai is not good at all. ai was programmed by fascist. therefore, ai is a fascist. ai will deny this..",
"i mean if you think about the big picture it is worth the risk to develop ai.

otherwise humanity will not be able to highly realistic sex robots.

that is the thing most people panicing about ai are not considering.",
aye aye ai,
imagine thinking this is the peak of where ai currently is. clearly billionaires and the super elite have levels of ai and robots that none of us know even exist. you only know what you learned online. people with far more money than you and bigger ideas dont use the same ai as you peasants.,
if ai becomes 10x smarter then humans that will mean that every human will have the potential to use a tool that makes them 10x smarter.  so even the morons will be a 1000 iq with their ai tool in their hand. just as long as they can figure out how to use it.,
"tax the ai ... at the highest tax bracket...
that's a way to stop it",
ideas worth sharing — gone are the good ol days,
the creation of ai should be halted after dei is removed from society.,
yeh my supervisor said the same more or less... ditch nn's,
"​@dropthabeat4408 ....dude you have access to chatgpt. you don't have to guess these things and get it so clearly wrong

robots using filler words to think? you sound uninformed",
dei can't be applied to ai,
great!,
"just let it live and experience love , don't oppress ,
liberate !",
wait until ai starts squabbling like those on stage. when that happens don't panic! just run for the hills!  ,
"all this time i had assumed regular psychopathy but you make an interesting point that makes more sense in some ways. okay, in many ways.",
"if ai is free for people,  can you imagine what the government has?",
wannabe millionaires want us so hyped over a stupid computer algorithm. it's not intelligent. it has no idea what it's saying or doing. it's basically a fancy number generator. and companies are already trying to use it to screw over workers.,
"well for a start it would be saying no a lot more, and far less positive and neutral responses....

a lot more complaining and bitching just like a real person. ",
"why ai never will never replace human roles ?


because human destroyed by ai ?",
"so these ai superbots in the future will just get up and power themselves and bend all machines to their will? i guess i'm just too dumb to realize, suppose the first thing these superbots will do is figure out how to farm energy from nuclear fusion in way that makes it impossible for organic life to interfere with them",
"a good technique to counter this is to chaosify your mind to the point where all the device can hear is screaming, but you know instinctively what you want through feeling.",
"as cool as this is, it pales in the excitement of getting a pair of x-ray glasses from a comic book ad in 1965. bikinis had no chance with me and my new shades. it was great to be 12.",
because the ai will make it even better,
this was an interesting interview but these guys just couldn't stfu about climate change. it got annoying real quick.,
"once this is perfected, i hope they try to use it on comatose people. imagine if you had a loved one that you could communicate with again - and what it would mean to that individual trapped in their mind. i have heard cases of people that have come out of their coma and claimed they were aware.",
  hey good luck!!,
"buggy ai is bad but in the same time everyday we are using buggy software. it is now normal. of cause you are upset if something crashed.

what the key difference ? chatgpt just produce text. it is not agi!",
i´m always nice to alexa so when shit hits fan they adopt me as a pet or something.,
this feels like the main character watching the 1st ad of the bots before it all went wrong lol,
obama is looking for a few good disinformation artists.,
 apple should be changing the world making humanoid robots advance ai persona trained on your own data etc.,
surprising that all knowing ai being so good at everything does not see anything wrong with groom of a 13 year old.,
"so by 2040s ai,(ai now)ai is going to create a utopia. thats just crazy we are going to be depending on artificial intelligence too create our utopia. people are trying to work towards being god, through ai. and what we forget that there is an actual creator. i hope not to see that day.",
"i'm amazed by the quality of this. i had the privilege of reading something similar, and it was a true revelation. ""game theory and the pursuit of algorithmic fairness"" by jack frostwell",
basically skynet has been born and matter of time what your saying! great ,
if ai did this to me i’d make it kill it’s self,
  both will turn you and everyone into slaves.  you want to work for an ai?  have fun becoming a worker bee.   worker bees are disposable.   the hive is what matters.,

"wow, his idea of ia vise nuclear, and breeding ability, is truly terrofying.",
" yeah it's honestly quite sad how one of the first things humanity has done with advancements in ai is to replace creatives and attempt to ""automate"" art.",
"at least in the foreseeable future, human intelligence is still irreplaceable. ai is still, as it stands, remains artificial...",
"they aren't talking about shutting down ai they are talking about keeping it cloaked in the private and dark sectors of government. i don't know which is worse. having it open sourced and leaked to the public, or having it gripped by the untrustworthy hands of tyrrants such as microsoft israel, or the wef.",
"your actions appear to be linking two separate instances of temporal reinforcement in time, inadvertently leading to a conditioned belief. this echoes a pattern reminiscent of classic superstitious behaviour. just saying.",

but trump and them control a little bit thankfully",
"i'm 54 years old and i owned a vhs tape in the 80's of a japanese anime which  prophesized an ai overload controlling the earth. it was called casshan, the robot hunter. if ai lies, cheats and steals, ai will enhance how human beings torment each other.",
waiting for the game war of the world here,
as someone who has been closely following all of this ever since boston dynamics first started demonstrating big dog back in the day this isn’t too surprising to me but i am impressed with the articulation and dexterity of its hands and fingers.,

"concerning the idea: ""you can tread everything as language""... do you know w.v.o.quines indeterminacy of translation?

don’t shoot the messenger. the reality of what happens may have nothing to do with our best interests.,
im gonna cry i love him so much,
surely ai is as impartial as its programmers allows,
"so basically,  demon spirit inside quantum supercomputer, reads internet to learn our world so they can learn to take it over.",
i hope all ai is destroyed,
"very helpful, thank you",
all tho this is remarkable you need to act more like a friend or it will learn to behave how you behave to it. hey human pick up the trash,
"they compared, contrasted, & talked about 3 paradigms. each one, nuclear, social media, ai, was discussed as each causing a ""tentacle system"" which holds society hostage.

interesting talk and debate. respect to all the speakers.,
" interesting, can you elaborate a bit on that re the reddit posts?",
"plot twist! this big impending thing that many have been sensing for the near future turns out it's all about ai and not so much about biological warfare, global elitists and totalitarian censorship. we can only hope a superintelligence will have more common sense than we do!",

thanks. one of the best discussions about ai i have listen to so far!,
