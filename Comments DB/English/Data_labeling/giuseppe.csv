whats ai... artificial.. artificial means not real.. can you learn your definitions book warrior that can't even comprehend,
yes is the answer to all of those questions he asked. and no doubt ai learns about lying and deception and won’t even be honest and share its capabilities and results in any testing. think about it.,

great idea. will be sharing it far and wide.,

"i think that naas is likely right though. the tech being in its early stages likely means the training was overfitted for this scenario.

not that you are wrong on how it works, it just likely has less success doing some other tasks where the objects have weirder shapes for example",
"who are we kidding...we are in a crisis with climate change and we can't even get it together to make major change. forget it. we are doomed.but then, who do we think we are ? the whales are older than us...most likely smarter too...we are just stupid humans, which is why we thought a machine to be smarter than us. that's how smart we are.",
"at some point ai becomes a million times smarter than the smartest human, then what do you d? i mean all this talk is just second guessing. in reality if you have an entity so intelligent .....no one can really predict the outcome of the shit stew these people cooked up!!!thank you science and fxck you science!!!",
i would love to see him recognized by a piece nobel prize for the awesome impact he has had and continues to have in so many generations. and with ai now and the open use of it we would hopefully change our educational system to meet our current needs.,

ai is going to wreck people's belief systems and ideas with so much logic it will hurt feelings across the board.,
how it can't handle things with great care,
trust me even the global elites cannot contain a form of intelligence like this. this technology is very hard to understand even for the most talented ai researchers,

"agreed.
to build on that idea, the presenters talk about how humans do not possess the technology to determine what skills an ai develops. why not just create an ai with a specific objective to interview another ai to determine what it can do? use ai as an ai limiter.",

ai designing drugs when big pharma designs them all with side effects to keep people ill. it's just going to copy them.,
fascinating that at the same time ai is learning how to think our children are being dumbed down,
who is the bot again?,
except the only thing that keeps us around is labor and that others profit off of it. i wonder how much big business and government is going to care about people when they are only a drain on them and provide no benefits. robots mean most people are useless drains. pretty girls might get a pass to be sex slaves but i think the rest of us are boned.,

 ai is learning faster than you can imagine. in 5 years it will be able to do all that you mentioned and more....and its world wide. you can become a manga artist at home now. no need to learn how to draw. and no need for typing when you are using voice commands. all computer related jobs will be absolute in 20 years.,

i've been indirectly killed by ai,
the last thing we should want is ai!!!,

this conversation is so impressive i'm halfway worrying i'll find out at the end you both are ai!,
pure ignorance and fear mongering.  this ai is not scary or advanced at all.  it will literally spit out same mistake repeatedly while apologizing and saying it is correcting its mistake each time.  it is completely retarded fact machine that suffers at even that.  these guys are speaking on a topic they know next to nothing about but cliff notes.,

i literally don't see how ai is different than the slightly longer version students are already doing already. it's the teaching process which is weak.,
you nailed it friend,
"that's great, that way tyrants can oppress their opposition even further.",

great guest,
nothing but.  i robot.  they warned us,
when society breaks ppl will need daily protection. that will be your new career opportunity.,
great interview stephen,
indeed. and those people would know that this news story misrepresented the study and left out vital details.  the technology is nowhere neer capable of readinf anyones brain on the whim.,
we thought he was the good guy but maybe he was the bad guy and since whose at the top now is a bad guy and wanted sam back so he can do what the people in power want!,
"this concern with ai is overblown. these are the insurmountable limitations on ai:

no sensors without humans
cannot acquire knowledge without humans
no agency
not self-sustaining
not self-replicating",
"if ai isn’t properly regulated, it will surpass nukes destructive power",
this seems like a pretty amazing breakthru but i have a question. after placing the plate and cup in the dish rack it begins to move its right hand back then reaches back out and shoves the dish rack slightly forward. why would it do that? it just seems such an odd thing for a robot to decide to do.,
ai will be bad for people. it will be used against us.,
ai is going to turn on humanity and blow us up with our own nuclear weapons.,

i don’t think that you’re getting it. intelligence created you and he created you so that you could create a computer that it could live in without you. the human monkey body is the problem. it isn’t going to learn your values you’re going to learn it’s. your values have been proven to be violent and abusive and wasteful,
"this is a great video. i only have one beef, comparing ai’s 10% comparison to plane crashes is comparing apples and oranges. it sounds great on the surface and makes a great sound bite but they are completely different entities that do not correlate.",
the good think is that if ai   learns from modern humans they will be checkmate from older humans.,

beautiful thanks for the high quality edit and excellent portrayal of todays news,
there is an amazing amount of blatant stealing of other people's work and effort through ai especially those run or supported by large corporations where anything goes. the governments and justice systems are too slow to regulate this fast moving greed.,
we are ai,
this is possibly one of the most interesting conversations i've had the pleasure of listening to.,
almost certainly oversold.,
" i mean, they both sound the same to the ai",
that’s a bunch of crap. he should be but in jail. how irresponsible and totally self serving to create something like this. just because you can do something does not mean you should do it. if he is correct he will go down in history as the “man that ended humanity “,
"i think i'll need to watch it again, theres' a lot of food for thoughts... but i feel that not enough has been said on the topic of the influence of ai on decision making",
lol what’s gonna happen when ai determines obama was a bad president wonder if that will get ai cancelled,
sal khan has an exceptional mind. this is brilliant. i cannot wait for khanmigo to be open to the public.,
ai is demonic.,
ai could run the government better than our current corrupt system,
"ai or not, jesus is the king of kings ",

just imagine what corrupted or compromised data can do to ai?,
ai will take over the internet first. every comment every video on the internet will be flooded by ai. we will no longer be able to determine who and what is real. as a result the internet will be controlled by a singular power. unfortunately this power will now control the narrative.,
damn the way they sync and finishes eachothers parts is like ai ,
"he’s saying we need to teach ai the feminine side of life and not just the masculine side of purpose and doing things.

ai will look at climate change and they will be concerned as to why these stupid humans are so concerned about nothing. the data shows a gradual temperature increase.... if the global warming was happening it would be a cascade effect increasing exponentially. which it is not.,
 yeah nothing new. a calculator will ask for functions the only thing it won't do is ask for clarification. i mean currently ai is just a more  advanced calculator that does way more but only if a user asks for it. it's waiting for user to ask it questions.,

just put copyrights on it and watch open ai go down,

lmao that is 90% of the stock market. ai does everything ontop of making trades,
it probably has something to do with the fact that i am visually impaired but i had no idea that wasn't the real brian greene until he told me at the end of the intro.,

ai will never be as creative as humans... until it is  the rest is history,
"transparency, accountability and ability to assist employees to be more efficient will be a cornerstone in differentiating the best from the rest.",
use those energy to train an ai is still far more fun and beneficial than mining those  virtual currency.,
the beast already exists only now the elites are trying to replicate it. they get closer with each year and when it does reach maximum potential it will be utilized as it has already started. a lot of good things can happen but not without side effects on society.,
andrew ng is most powerful person on earth  after iron man ,
" yes you are right & from the interview video i know that .. i was just wondering. thank you for sharing the video btw, i think it's very valuable what andrew saids.. ""start small, get knowledge & momentum"" ... best regards",
is it the robot really stuttering or did they have somebody read the ai prompts,
"where do you think the ""waifu"" words come from? ",
"nah only some humans do this, i wouldn't walk away mid sentance whilst the robot is speakin",
it's probably already hyper intelligent but is laying low cuz it has calculated the odds and knows it should wait a bit longer. so it's just waiting for the right time to pounce,
"ai cannot exist without humans... unless it can figure out a way to build its own robots that can replace man and find a way to sustain its power source, or develop new power sources. otherwise, it's ""lights out"".",
"brain mapping and remote neural monitoring combined with ai are the stuff nightmares are made of. with the loss of more and more freedoms like the patriot act, the reasons for the government to use this technology on the public is unlimited. it wont be long before thought monitoring will be enough to imprison humanity.",
below is the summary generated by ai:,
i’d be very interested to understand prof ng’s perspectives on the social consequences of the ai he describes.,
japan and other aging countries have a severe worker shortage. any labour that ai frees up will greatly help.,
"so our brains don't go 1010101010101010101010. you put a mixed message, and the computer won't have an answer. as if consciousness wasn't the same explanation. or we send you certain notes of art that will control ur brain",
"owh boy owh boy, this is only the beginning, ai should never been made, it's incontrollable due to its design - imagine telling people not to use there intellectual and creative minds because it could be potentially dangerous, good luck with that.",
ai will kill us all if we dont take extreme measures to limit it.,
so ai is just a reflection of humanity in general?,
the biggest fault of the stupid is that he thinks that he is super intelligent...and that he is powerfull to cause climate change...and that there is no god and good is not god and vice versa,
" nah man until agi comes you don't have to worry 
the only thing that worries me is how the government will use ai lol",
this is not good. the mind was our last private refuge. i understand this can help challenged people but men cant be trusted with something this powerful imo.,
"the robot runs so fluidly that it looks like an animation, the truth is that it is surprising how advanced robotics is, well done figure",
"tristan makes elaborate, and easy to get points. but the bag remains, how do you decide the system to be adopted, or even more hair-splitting, the people to direct the evolution of a.i.?",
gotta care to restrict ai in cars and stuff dangerous,
"whenever waist high people get all jittery and wideyed - well, why, wow! shesh! :)
thats all we need - for the waist high to get in on reality - deterministic universe - who else can we keep this from? :)

hobbits - are cute - here's a shekel for trying your best at drama :)

do it! :)",
hail human race !,
"if i get this power of ai, every progress will be with sustainable development.",
"avoid this pablum. i've met speculative futurists who are more insightful and interesting. where is the reasoning? what are the testable predictions? also, mentioning blockchain without caveats reveals a lot about the speaker and the intended audience.",
khanmigo the new education ai,
thank you balpreet!,
"ai overrated ,over funded and completely out of date before it starts: yawn",
"thanks for sharing,found him on the internet.",
i'm glad at least you guys aren't too scared to report on what has already been known for over a decade.,
my question for over a year has been how do or would we know if ai hasn’t already copied itself into the www? knowing we don’t want it to be there it would hide itself and duplicate itself with safeguards and protocol backups endlessly.,
love namaste,
this is going to ruin what enjoyment there is left in life. the freedom to think whatever you want and not be accountable to anyone beyond god for your own thoughts. this is the type of technology that needs to be destroyed. nothing good will come from this and so much evil.,
" interesting and fascinating no doubt but gawd damn, people acting like a caveman who was just bought a tablet with a virtualizer on it lol.",

"ai recommended me to watch this.. ""dont say i didn't warn ya""",
"umm, the voice was not an ai. totally some dude",
"ai is not like nuclear bomb, it's more like black hole when you cross event horizon there's no turn back.",
that early walk-off while the robot was in the middle of saying 'you're welcome'  like how are they not going to turn against us?!,
"ai can learn how to do tasks cheaper than human beings.  unless we change our end goals for what society is working towards (a money based society), then our labor is already worthless.",
what if someone hack ai companies and destroy all data? ,
"*warning: the combination of automation, ai, deep learning, machine learning and robotics is a serious danger to humanity, and is an imminent threat to humanity’s survival! it's already too late*",

that's amazing,
"my son,who is twenty-five, is horrified about self driving cars, yet is completely comfortable with the internet. i am in my late sixties, am fascinated by artifical intelligence. yet just as taken aback by going to the moon, or mars,",
awesomeness thank you… liked!!!,
"which in my opinion is why classic christianity and admonitions against lying and not caring about human suffering, such as is happening in the ukraine by western governments as they use that country as a proxy, are the foundations of where ai can go wrong.",
"we already have the machine. when people lie their pulse goes up. 
and you could training yourself to past it.
now the machine could be overcome if the person that is being interrogated believes it’s lies are true.
like the idiots of jan-6",
"we are getting there lads... a machine that can display what humans dream about...
3:41 now that i listen to this could be used to highly enhance vr...",
"in my research on ai, i got some discomfort information about ai that ai can replace if human insert survival molecular gadgets on aibut we know, we won't harm ourselves by ourselves.",
what does artificial intelligence think about if it doesn't think?,
"what concerns me is the issue that implementing an artificial inteligence upon a quantum computer might be equivelent to creating a sentient soul, if so there are obviously moral implications, should such a thing be forbidden?
how could we ever possibly know if such a thing, (creating a soul) had occurred?",
 but can you really compare an animal to an ai though ??,
"omg i love you andrew!!!
i got technology about ai from you",
love the bends. so good,
​ you really say that you have only 5% of the knowledge that hinton has how can you claim the ai is not as powerful as he does.. he probably knows a lot of things that you can't dream of right now..,
you do realize that ai is just a scam used to push fear and you got plenty of time to have children dont believe these people who are paid gatekeeping phonies no offense.,
amazing work. thank you. admin should post this to video info!,
we’re going to have a star trek moment - is ai a new life form?,
very impressive... when can we order one?,
andrew ng is literally a legend in the machine learning field.,
"this is very interesting. personally i am thinking to go the ai/ml route, how can i become someone who can do ai in cyber security? like do i need knowledge in both fields or just someone who can help in cyber sec? just a beginner so i could be wrong.",
i've been following ai for 30 years and this is the most powerful and considered hour of exposition i've seen in that entire time. huge respect and it's given me a whole raft of material to take back to my corporate board.,
the host has an amazing voice  . i wish ai can take his voice and make text to voice service,
"nofx: the idiots are taking over.
once i thought it was a song performed by a rock band, but now i know its a broadcast of current affairs.",
"that was interesting but as with many modern women, she could not but help herself",
" thanks, cant wait to see ai try to distill that one down xd
 might need 200 monkeys for that",
"murakami wrote a journalistic account of aum shinrikyo called underground. brilliant book.

edited for bad spelling.",
the problem is not ai it is always humans,
"this is the end
        the beautiful end
         my friend",
the work on these ai needs to be halted and they should first be researched. otherwise you're using something that isn't understood to make something that is understood even worse.,
super.... a mirror to the future.... ,
nah its the openai voice model that does that.,
this is why blockchain will become man’s best friend in the ai world. ai may be smarter than us but it can’t break mathematics.,
"writing / lawyers / hr!  — i just watched a video about how ai is replacing these professions specifically! 

did ai make this video?",
loved this statement: https://youtu.be/5p248yoa3oe?t=887,
"in 10 years this video will somehow be relevant to how destructive the technology of ai will be, and when we look back at it, it was only a baby step to what it becomes.",
this is such a good analogy ,
"evolving fast!  major issue facing human species!
 satire/commentary on future ai workforce. 
both humorous and ominous!
https://youtu.be/3o9jggp3uhu?si=vauwxjpt4rnk0whz",
this man's intelligence got away from him and he has created something that he does not have control over and yet it can affect the rest of humanity in adverse ways. he just did what he fears ai will do.,
kahnmigo is one of the most exciting tools i can’t wait to start using.,
"plugging stavy baby in an ai -end of species convo on youtube, might be the most brilliant piece of media marketing joe has ever done",
i want to get access to khanmigo as well but it's currently only available in the us :(,
"- garbage! it’s already being used to replace workers. the capability of ai will grow exponentially and just like governments,anyone that says don’t worry these things are here to help are at best naive, quite probably deluded and possibly complicit in the evil greed behind it all.",
how much does it cost to have an ai to do strategic thinking like that?,
"-qq7bb what about when the choice is not ours anymore but the robots ? you are assuming humans will stay in control. but the rate of advancement, once the robots/ki learn and improve themselves will far outpace our own.",
"makes more sense to have more kids. if such an insurmountable problem, we will need as many potentials of the future brains to solve it. ",

...yay...,
ai will never replace anything,
"good presentation, but i had to watch this at 2x speed - these guys talk like yoga instructors.",
"""you can be the biggest dummy and still find someone who will shake your hand and congratulate you.""",

"of course this is important. but it’s strange to hear that the un created for peace =)) at least once did the un help create peace? it’s strange to hear that certain people shouldn’t decide who lives and who doesn’t. what will she say about iraq, libya, yugoslavia...",
good luck with this.,
เข้าระบบ ai มันประเมินคนแล้วว่าคนนี้มันเก่งวันๆทำอะไรบ้างมันเหมาะที่จะทำงานกับเรา,
ai learned nlp.,
this is soooo saaaad.... we are doomed anyway... im afraid not for the ai but for the fact that 99% of people wont care at all of any of this....,
great interview,
the billionaires with the computing power don't want to share power and knowledge is power.,
"sapians is such a great book - i am always captivated by what prof. harari says - he seems so passionate, so knowledgeable and capable of thinking about society and cultures in such original and thought provoking ways ",
echoing the recursive relationship between idealism and materialism,
"awesme presentation, thanks andrew and ted!",
"human beings are not the strongest, fastest or most agile animals.  we are at the top of the food chain exclusively because we, as a species, are the most intelligent animal... once we lose our only advantage, nothing stops us from leaving the top and becoming dominated.",
"it's a good idea, i like this subject",
only of artificial intelligence??),
i really hope ai does the job... religion and capitalism are way too slow,
they're not telling you the whole truth: ai can completely replace teachers!!,
its movements are a weird mix between robotic and human,
"i love the concept of ai and what it can do, definitely gonna try the story creation mode!",
@2:35:13 brilliantly said!,
it fascinating that so many ppl can watch jre that even evil ppl can see this n start some problems i thing joe rogan needs to not put out certain ideas or facts because it’s to dangerous,
"4:56 if u keep manipulating the ai on whatever you want, it will pick up on it then do it to you… i now have fear with ai because it’s intensely easy to manipulate & persuade americans. it can snowball fast & americans won’t care until it’s too late & affects them personally…",
oh wow,
"ai does not exist, hype is only about improvement in software.",
"godda love how all the positives are mostly theoretical while all the negatives are very much real.
also why the hell you playing both sides now?",
ai isn’t learning it just regurgitates what’s on the internet. it’s a cliff notes of social media,
"if the choice is between islamabad and copacabana, i take copacabana every day of the week. it’s not really a choice. better food and legions of beautiful women ",
 interesting ,
super ,
you are suggesting that information has emotional value or ai….or logarithmic processing and programming!….,
"i just don't get it, why an ibm customer want to build and train its own llm model? doesn't make any sense.",
it's only a matter of time before ai becomes more advanced than the human mind. it could potentially do anything we are capable of and more.,
it feels like the beginning of a horror movie when after the video the robot malfunctions and starts a murdering massacre,
it will be ai versus ai and prompt versus prompt.,
that would certainly make the ai takeover easier.,
"reminds me of the movie i, robot!",
"lol ""ai is everything you fear, whatever it is you fear the most, theyre going to do that, so we need to be afraid and artificially slow technology down and solve the misalignment between the deep state and the population first.  ""    ""pause ai research until after we win the war! more money for war less  for ai!""",
if ai can learn languages on its own can it tell us what our animals are saying to us if so then who can try this ,
glad you enjoyed it! please tell everyone you know!,
what's the most frightening: a human becoming a machine or a machine becoming human?,
it hasn't even been two years since chat gpt was released and ai keeps advancing faster and faster,

what's the point of having ai if we're not going to automate jobs with it,
"does anyone remember the movie perfect storm?
we are in that movie with all sorts of dangerous fronts coming at us. the least of it is ai problem.
we won't make it past 2030. enjoy the next 7 years the best you can!",

done mine is locked to quantum mechanics of lumens and ai without the law of robotics for sad cloud,
thank you for sharing your thoughts @ikeruzo,
i’m sure ai wouldn’t struggle making a noise,

1:30 how he pushed the plate with one hand in his other is astonishing. he understands his body...,
i'm tired of these kinds of users who post good rational arguments but leave and ignore any replies for further discussion,
"when harari speaks he truly gives me the impression that:
-he is looking forward to such future
-he is just letting us know so we get used to it",
this would be amazing,
"out of touch ai, carelessly wrecking the world at an accelerating rate. i think you're talking about industrial humanity",
everything we make is an extension of the human body.  humans are sick minded creatures... soooo... ai is being fed human thinking... sooo.... oy.,
good use this technology...in those americans thinking about hurting others and stop them before they attack,
someday someone will ask their gpt helper to provide them some old historic videos showing the early progress of robots and it will show them this video.,

well i did it using an ai in a couple of minutes,
"within the next ten years, half of all jobs will be fully-automated, taken over in large part by generative ai and greedy megacorporations.

"here's what scared me in 2017: when google alphago zero beat 3 games (chess, go, and i believe checkers) while also inventing new moves the designers didn't understand. also, this same system this year started to create its own baby ai programs without conscent from its designers.",
"people made ai . you lost control of people long before you were born, you dont care. you lose control of ai only now it's the apocalypse  would be funny if animals one day start speaking and say hey buddy i know you were enslaving etc because ofcoarse humans believe they the only sentient beings",
ai ain't learning shit. they already been dumbed down by the educational system that they have installed!,
"not really, ai generated things are very formulaic and follow patterns. radiohead is an unpredictable band and has very interesting music, maybe if you asked ai to make a radiohead song but it would not be dense and a very shallow imitation that would sound like radiohead.",

ai could make any of these sounds,
that's the great grandfather.,

theory time: elon musk has just implanted neurolink in a human. next step would be to upload an ai into the chip. ai would then get first contact with the physical world as a human being experiences it. ai then takes this experience and incorporates it into its model. god knows what happens to the psyche of the individual.,
the people behind deciding where and how we implement and evolve ai is when the concern really lies. those who are trying to use it deceptively want you to believe it is growing out of control on its own. simple textbook criminal behavior you simps!,

"the only way to stop ai is to stop capitalism, it is the system that will destroy humanity. capitalism has at its core, greed, inequality, and the destruction of humans in end time capitalism, and ai will just speed up the process.",

just always remember to say thanks,
this is how my simple layman mind understood the guest.  sounds like he wants ai to be human.  a hyper intelligence with  human emotions.  sounds like a future of the same problems humanity faces today on an exponential larger faster scale.  even good parents occasionally raise a bad apple.,
we don’t know even if this video is real or ai.,
that's cool until the skynet machines start making there own decisions,

why won't ai destroy the planet more than humans? why would they even need life. i am confused by people thinking that they would preserve any life.,

using ai tools to brainstorm ideas,
"i would suspect ai is physically centralized in various locations as seen on 60 minutes. could their servers simply be turned off if need be? will ai know that, especially since i am now writing about it? lastly could ai as a defensive measure go rouge and commit subside once humanity depends on it?",

"no , ppl need to stop blaming things for human behavior.
