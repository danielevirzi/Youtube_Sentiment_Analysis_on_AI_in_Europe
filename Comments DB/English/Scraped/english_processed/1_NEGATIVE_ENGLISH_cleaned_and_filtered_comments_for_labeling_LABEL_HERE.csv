11502,"90% chance ai would kill humans 10 years, focusing distraction slightly racist image generation models exist today? rather strange priorities. ai level dangerous, focusing that."
11503,speaker seem suggest ai issues important. that's misleading clickbait title someone ted came with.
11509,ai iss
11514,things focusing kind ridiculous. run ai locally solar system. mention inefficient they're ever going be.
11515,getting matrioska brain ai quite yet. (ie ai's use power one solar system. probably disassembling planets produce dyson sphere) give another 50 years.
11518,"falls down, individual get choose 'good' ai model, ai used governmental entity, corporation etc. without explicit consent even knowledge ai part decision them."
11524,"world ai technology, change constant. openai gearing inaugural developer conference, decoder, astonishing update chatgpt made way public."
11525,"6:51 ai creators even know ai models act strange ways, categorically convince us ai models never turn us humans wipe us out?"
11528,point solve present problems new technology undeniably fantastic work much needed. assessment future risks important? especially (at least humble knowledge) growing complexity become ever difficult anticipate prevent every possible harmful output?
11532,"actually eliminating harmful output impossible, full stop. why? ""intelligence"" all. method entropic catagorization, system lossy storage like memory, static. filtering ""bad"" input also impossible."
11541,"a.i could set factories build drones fake business name like jim's cars. outside looks like car repair shop, inside built 5000 drones month. imagine x 10 000 world wide. would take over. idea levels lying deceiving a.i do."
11547,populated machines taking jobs.this needs talked about.
11548,"human need income, jobs. real problems wealth distribution inequality among human, ai taking job."
11549,real problem always people complaining weather anything
11550,imagine thinking reasons ai dangerous. 1. climate change - negligible impact compared industry 2. bias - easily corrected - add training data diversity 3. ??? existential risks distraction? lol far ted fallen.
11551,think incredibly dangerous propaganda tool. could destroy ability tell truth fiction
11553,ai doomerism companies tech ceo's trying achieve regulatory capture
11554,regulating ai means megacorps goverments would ones capable training running
11556,"ai like anything humans create: religion, war, hatred!"
11559,wonder much carbon releases complaining.
11561,"every teacher world used works artists masters train students without artists consent. training, students go world create art. need sue every teacher learning institution failing get permission artists use teaching tool?"
11562,difference ai product sale. steal art resell it. teaching kid. closer building cell phone somebody stolen plans.
11563,"waiting agi prominent, bring robots"
11564,initial energy requirements ai substantial models trained high energy cost rear view
11565,need train model millions use it. nobody complains movie costing millions dollars millions people pay watch hours.
11567,thank you~~~~~~~~~~
11569,"many people could lose jobs ai progress. unemployed ones can't feed families, could violent crimes"
11570,"no, time people lost job, also gaining access ai, gain income them. people really needs incomes, job. future, ai jobs, people get incomes feed family."
11574,training models takes vast amount power running fully trained model answer queries need anywhere near power. get right please - get stage!
11576,i've finding layering llm image generation process completely fix diversity issue. i've using chatgpt's access dalle-3 generating diverse cast people without need even ask to. seems like openai working make llm diverse baseline.
11577,"firstly, can't. secondly can't test it, asinine claim make. really solve anything systems create, closer memory intelligence stretch."
11581,ai parasitically use us long politically correct?
11582,clickbaity title
11583,wailing devil witches real threat.
11591,"basically and, oh yeah forgot ted puts woke bs wef talking points now. really, she’s worried carbon footprint? oh my, mainframe creates much carbon 30 average private homes. bye ted"
11593,hear optimism ai pros again. one thing sure: unlikely future develop way think will. also entails speed development.
11594,"really isn't, least context implying. **that** ""ai"" exist. but! corporations might well alien intelligence worried about, human motivations often blatantly destructive even due conflicts interest."
11597,worried misalignment. larger dangerous concern view control ai deciding aligned.

11605,"problems potentially something ai help us better at, far dangerous possible outcomes. click bait"
11606,"exactly - main problem 'ai alignment', occur magically. shocked, honestly, laissez faire seems topic..."
11609,"nice vision... least first part. would hope something like this, accept cannot project human-level sensibilities onto thought processes we, definition, cannot possibly understand."
11612,"like vision, seriously, claiming know machine twice smart going think? ok then, one million times smarter?"
11620,"already recognized key goal (bias) crafting training data ""clean"" new generations ai. recognized immediately eliminate ""bad data in, bad data out"" scrubbing training data..."
11623,"​ yes, absolutely, surprised though. i'd say 95% people complete fools really idea what's coming years. that's way human brain works, stuck linear thinking mostly unable even comprehend exponentially although around us"
11624,"thing is, regulation help ai annihilating us wish to. need proper preparation train ai look find solutions could potentially save bu.tts"
11625,"singularity, i'd say 5-10 years top, we're lucky..."
11628,good talk!
11629,dishonest cherry picking leave favor painting picture 'unethical ai'. bad talk.
11635,"man works energy sector ai wanna know messure emissions. worried china's emissions ai co2. sure, reduce cost computetion learning."
11637,one knows make ai bad things. bunch patches kind work dumb ai likely fail smart ai.
11639,"wonderful suggestion, nobody's figured way build safety rules ai. know how, we'd grateful."
11642,"dude, job. ai? seem understand nuances saying, yet want argue point already made clear. chill out, bot, go away."
11647,western culture diverse world. ai trained chinese data would even worse bias. western closest get truly global multiculturalism.
11648,love people make talk subject little knowledge of. talk made lose brain cells
11649,ai carbon emissions? lol wtf
11652,"average person questions this, shamed. unfortunately, takes person degree say thing, get praised others understand without letters name."
11653,i've never shamed i've brought issues. earth talking about? who's shaming anyone talking interesting ideas?

11678,absolutely! thanks comment!
11679,actually find talk misleading. example compare training emissions saved emissions ai.
11681,"thank you! effervescently dope gallery informational points man, deeply appreciate summary made."
11682,done ai. tell
11685,robots pretend perceiving things often fail understand sense grants perception. end incoherent.
11686,thank much.
11687,gratitude whoever are... gist also ai generated?
11690,love kind responses
11692,"thanks, pretty much liberal regressive leftist credibility"

11705,"artist, care less ai taking commercial art jobs humans, bc human commercial artist stealing work less established artists long time now. non-issue though copyrights real sense actually matters. ai making art good thing."
11706,emissions caused training ai models negligible compared things like heavy industry. wonder also measured much emissions produced playing video games maintaining whole internet.
11708,good answer
11711,"agreed, benefit models emissions might save work finished quicker/better/... looked context talk."
11713,"@ observed lot left online space shave one two knee-jerk reactions ai: a) ""it must scam like bitcoin!!!"" b) ""it must shut tool rich danger jobs/ecology/whatever!!! people utterly blindsided development ai next 3 years."

11715,thank comment. good example whataboutism.
11722,thank information.
11725,"i've multiple times talking woman doctor, they've said ""what say""(my doc woman). humans know better stereotype know we'll stop machines trying us it."
11727,"1.2 men every woman doctor (aka 20% men) justify bias? similar nursing profession ,only bias opposite (usually depicted women nurses),and percentage men lot smaller doctors."
11729,sure models trained actual copyrighted images trained images (heavily) inspired images?
11735,"note ""biased information"" often simply means accurate representation reality. ideologues say work remove those, lobotomize ai work goals."
11736,ai models mirror reflection society. maybe don’t like see
11737,"""we can't regulate ai"". not? healthcare industry us derrgulated and, unless economic flat-earther, know caused harm good."

11743,artists real life care inspiration/data used develop skills come from????? problem ai?
11745,"people used say internet dangerous would destroy us. weren’t wrong. us screen front us 90% day. ai take us rabbit hole, inherently bad humans lack self control."
11751,well truly looking implications tiktok social media youth? guess ignorance bliss. yes positives great cost ignoring negative?
11762,humanity flaws doubt ai could really understand reasoning anything.. mention people programming ai completely crazy disconnected humanity. .

11768,"too, education could help raise awareness pressure organisations change!"
11771,"yes, human lack self control. one could even say illusion control human feels exhibit dependent upon environment lives currently huge parts human mass losing due supersystems part of."
11779,"destroyed ourselves, blame internet ai."
11782,seem limited understanding issue. try listen read emit limited opinion. thank you!
11783,thanks helpful critique
11784,best way destroy ai get put control destroy electrical grids problems solve.

11792,lack self control. things completely high jack chemical systems brains bodies way almost nobody get ahead of.
11795,maybe enjoy

11872,excellent speaker contemporary topic..ai needs kept within strict boundaries stays assistant/tool
11874,talking got ai far past already
