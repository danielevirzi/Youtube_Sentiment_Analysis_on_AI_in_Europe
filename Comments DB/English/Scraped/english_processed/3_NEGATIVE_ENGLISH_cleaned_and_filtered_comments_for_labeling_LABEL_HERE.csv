1627,artificial intelligence match natural stupidity.
1628,"ai new. nothing artificial ""intelligence"" average liberal scientist."
1631,problem ai human created human influenced. especially humans want push narrative. exact reason google gemini failed badly pushing narrative anti whiteism.
1633,many people influenced consume internet. increasingly content generated ai. imagine world people mostly influenced ai content.
1636,micro ai-stics

1656,fascinating. also ai give sources problem.
1659,"put sh@t, sh$t comes out. intelligence, library smart stores 1000s books"
1661,obvious ai outputs lose creativity fed outputs back training data. ai models still benefit ai another model generated training data.
