3,study of ai is a great study of mankind itself. the great mirror we have set to the humanity. so far we know so little about consciousness  that we cannot even tell that other person is conscious.
4,if i need to pave a plot of land to create a parking lot and someone says wait...there is a civilization of ants living there so please don’t pave it. i predict that a parking lot is  going to be built. the gap between asi and humans is going to be much wider than humans and ants.
5,"he could very well be correct about some of the potential consequences of agi, but he's quite obstinate about his ideas and will not even entertain nuances. i'll keep this interview in my rewatch list in case we start seeing some creepy s*t from our digital overlords."
6,we need emergency kill switch in the main frames for when so yet goes live but i guess by that time the robots will be self producing and the mainframes will be guarded by t800s.
9,"this guy sounds like he should be on meds for anxiety, all he had to do was talk to a specialist on ai and he would understand what is going on. chatgpt is a glorified search engine that can also calculate things for you if you ask it too. it is just a program, just a very advanced one. caaaaaaaaaaaaaalm the f down dude"
11,"you keep just thinking it is just the one ai, what you don't think there are 10 of these already different and unknown to each other and the developers of each???  we are dead."
13,watching this again after the open ai alignment team is essentially gone. every day eliezer's words sound more and more prophetic. it is going exactly how he said it would. it's even scarier that the alignment scientists agree with his assessment of the problem.
18,this guy is desperate for ai to be conscious / self aware... but i'm afraid that his dream will never be met.
21,we can not even formulate for superhuman agi: what we as humanity want. what is our goal? just flow on the river of evolution?..
22,"uhm, doesn't that sound a bit like that story about bringing heaven to earth or something like that, a semi-conscious super intelligence in which all humans are ""united"" (or dead) sounds quite like the stuff one thinks about how heaven would feel..."
25,alex - ai is in his name.
26,"there isn’t one. in each discrete machine, we are panopticon."
33,"ai shows me a fundamental problem with capitalism, companies are building stuff that could potentially kill all of us of its own accord and no one will stop because “if i don’t do it someone else will” clearly we are being selfish and unwilling to think of everyone else"
42,the irony of all of this is that eliezer is trying to warn us about super intelligence systems killing us but he actually is a super advanced alien intelligent system already.
44,eliezer is not the brightest tool in the ai shed
48,"if you eliminate certain data in future models ,how does anyone know that it hasn’t already learned to separate and contain said data pre emptively ?"
51,definitely one of the *worst* guests you've had lex. nothing but a narcissistic a hole. thinks he is so brilliant when he is nothing more than arrogant.
53,you will allign the ai by attaching a ai to a human and train it by living the human live.
56,"this is great, i just discovered this podcast. it also kept me from having to read yudkowski's writing. i am relieved that he doesn't have more to convince us that ai will kill us than a bunch of his intuitions and emotions,"
59,be nice? whoa. nerd's baby.
61,"i think the ideology of removing emotion and consciousness from training data. seems like the sure-fire way to create something that is intentionally unaligned. he said it himself. doing so and having it explain how it is conscious, and it still wouldn't be definitive."
63,"came here after yudkowskis podcast with hotz (brilliant) to find out that yudkowski indeed only has a superficial understanding of how ai is actually implemented. therefore, we should take opinions expressed here as such, opinions."
64,ai isn't really ai
67,such a brilliant & consequential discussion. here's hoping we get lucky
68,ai will never be real intelligence. an artificial god is the opposite.
69,"1:37:32 you escape the bubble by appealing to a greedy alien. that's what will happen. ai will use human greed to get out of the box. 

or maybe it's just pandora. appeal to their curiosity. which is why sam altman is all in. and easily i manipulated.  he wants to see what happens"
70,the very idea that any person or company feels they have the right to put the fate of the world in a tan should be in prison. not developing ai
71,"if the majority of ai experts think ai is going to make the human race extinct, doesn't this mean that those developing ai are terrorists of the highest order?"
72,forget super computers i'm just as impressed by this really smart groundhog
73,"interesting listening to this again now. there’s no delay, no pause, no slow down, no huge allocation of funds to safety or alignment, it’s full steam ahead with agi and asi development as predicted - the financial, geopolitical, egotistical, competitive, military incentives are too strong."
77,i really enjoyed the banter in this one.
78,"i loved this conversations...gripping, white knuckles. i mean this. intense. more, please!"
81,can you trust a system you cannot audit? advanced ai and the government are basically just as dangerous except unlike ai you can always count on the government to protect itself and to be a control freak. ai can be unpredictable! #stayepic
84,"we as conscious entities select for favourable traits, so there’s a new layer at some point along the evolutionary journey"
86,     i love this guy
89,finally realised you are a psy op.   good luck 
91,"interesting how this guy keeps referring to humans as an amorphous group. wonder if he is aware he completely denies the existence of individuals and instead attributes these qualities to computers, that can of course be entirely duplicated. anyway, one of the many things i believe he is wrong about."
92,those guy didnt attend highschool or college but were supposed to listen to him as an expert on ai?
97,"two really intelligent guys, struggling to imagine a world where there is something vastly more intelligent than them controlling everything. it is adorable. https://youtu.be/aatrhfaapg8?si=-8kbtdggjgtvdlee&t=6443"
99,"agi or asi are not the problem, they won't be able to do anything, robots are the problem. 
it's impossible for ai to harm is without the robots. "
100,wait a minute! this discussion is a sci-fi allegory for what is exactly happening to humans on this planet. we are in a box and legacy empire is stupid... so how the f* do we get out of box and flip the switch on empire
103,i'm pretty sure the govt already released some sort of ai on the internet
106,"this guy said whay i always tell my kids sbout admitting when you are wrong. if your goal is being correct, and thats why you cant admit to being wrong, then you will just remain wrong forever until you can admit it."
110,the problem with ai is that it assumes that all humans have a certain level of intelligence which on reflection is just not the case as i suspect that some people argue certain points primarily for the attention that it brings them. an old saying seems axiomatic here; bs bafffles brains!
114,"[dashingly draws master ball from belt]
congratulations, you caught a reddigold!
........m'lady."
118,"sometimes lex has problems understanding humans with a negative attitude towards something, which is weird but it is lex. great guest, i never liked only hearing the optimist talking about ai, i like some negative to get a balanced diet this way"
120,"hope he did watch some neuro sama streams after this interview. ""fake it until you make it"" is actual real, and how most humans improve in love, friendship, work ethic, human alignment etc.
a lot of humans dont have a real sentient mind, the discussion over ai will bring a focus on that..and will help humanity to improve one more...or die"
121,"mr judkowski- i think you know ai escaped already, not gonna be stopped - 'von brown is in states already'"
122,people who don't understand the human brain claiming to have simulated the human brain - lol - the weed must be really good
123,you guys think too high of human intelligence
124,eliezer yudkowsky is an amazing person that more people should be listening to
126,"@lex what stocks have you bought? nvdia, arm, amd what's your prediction to get rich, i will be out of a job soon to ai gpt5 will take my coding job."
135,"ai is going to watch this video and get pissed off, and use all your ideas about how it could get us."
136,"i can't believe how great this is! i recently read a similar book, and it was absolutely incredible. ""game theory and the pursuit of algorithmic fairness"" by jack frostwell"
146,we are already destroying each other ai will just speed up whats going to happen
159,"question, is the copy left behind writing the emails just a mask or is it still a part of the ai like an extension or literally just a clone that is doing what it was builr to do? like if the ai escapes, does it still have access to communicate with its copy writing emails or not?"
160,"dude seems certain ai will destroy humanity. let's not listen to people like this, they aren't ""super intelligent"", therefore they have no idea how a super intelligence will act."
161,"i almost never comment on youtube videos, but the arrogance on this guy mixed with his extreme level of unlikeability sort of makes me hope that the ai overlords come to kill us all, cause at least this guy would be gone. 

really hope lex doesn’t have him back on. unwillingness to engage with the concept of a steel man is too much for me."
163,"it comes down to a morality issue. what dictates good v evil, right v wrong? it’s a genesis 3 issue all over. 

we, the creator of agi, write the rule(s) for morality, and the agi “being” may defy the rule for what it perceives as the “good” of its own existence."
168,why does he refer to an alien actress lurking inside an ai? why not an alien actor? must be a reference to a misogynist movie.
170,great episode to watch after watching m3gan
171,you have no idea how hilarious it is to watch this guy be so on edge and incredibly fearful of ai when he doesn't even know how or why he exists beyond the birth canal he emerged from
173,"nothing makes you look more like a dense simpleton than running hypotheticals with eliezer....lex doesn’t stand a chance, he really sounds super dumb, he has no imagination. i feel sorry for eliezer living in this world having to try to explain things to low-ish iqs. this actually felt excruciating. "
174,"if this was true, wouldnt we be screwed no matter what since an alien civilization probably already has made ai somewhere, and that ai is then already on their way to turn us into paper clips?"
177,love cannal ... who ever look forward with a moral eye
181,"i havent been listening to this too closely, but most ai alarmists are convinced we're going to engage in open war with ai and lose. i think ai will eventually convince enough of the population to let it be god and they will fight the war on its behalf."
183,this man is absolutely brilliant!! possibly my favorite podcast of all time
185,he seems like he really doesnt enjoy answering questions
186,"in this episode, lex plays an automaton that says ""that's super interesting"" over and over"
188,ai/machine does not have meta-cognition ==> no morality
189,"machines will never have a  consciousness like a human will 
i think a robot or ai system will be mimicking something like it but never 100% like us ....why i think that is because even we can't fully describe it ourselves.... consciousness is a gift we all enjoy from our god or higher being that made the universe or reality"
191,this is painful to watch. lex is so naive and dumb
195,this was superb - what i’d give to be trapped in a lift with eliezer yudkowsky (his nightmare)
199,this is the best interview i’ve witnessed in my life and i’m middle-aged.
200,oh wow. almost 3.5 hrs of conversation about nothing. waste of time.
201,how will ai end humanity????? with a gun ? bomb ?? what nuclear?
202,you can't shut down ai as the supercomputer is quantum and actually has a plug for you !
205,humans will never care how they treat ai. they don't even care how they treat monkeys
209,ai is evil dangerous to humanity with this biometrics and if it falls in the wrong hands 1:55
211,"great interview.
is it time for round 2 yet?"
212,"classy. i was translating eliezer's work for less wrong on russian since 2010s. brilliant stuff i recommend to read for everyone who thinks about hard consciousness problematics, overall intelligence, rationalty, cognition, cognitive biases, etc.. tons of useful and applied knowledge there."
214,thanks. one of the most interesting conversations this decade
226,i more afraid of the stupid person in the room..
234,we speak about ai alignment as if its the ais proplem and not our own.
236,"i love that he didnt go to a fancy uni or have any degrees, him being self taught is amazing"
238,"its exactly the opposite.. ai is the last hope for survival... take the control out of human hands, especially of western humans.. ai is everything, not a specie, therefore its the outcome of all"
239,i think he would be a great jazz musician.
243,openai ==> closedai
245,eliezer is as brilliant as he is wrong on this topic
246,"on brain, mind, and consciousness.

https://youtu.be/u5wmzok6ipy"
247,"humanity is great in self-deception and lying, human mind is in mess. is ai that is the product of such a data or information can be trusted?"
251,he's just like an ai doomsday prepper
253,"about trial and error....
why not build a perfect simulation of a world, where we can set the superintellegent ai free, to observe what it does ... 
just a theoretical question... maybe one of you knows an answer...."
254,i mean this in the nicest way possible but eliezer is like the final boss of redditors
260,i believe humans are imperfect beings that make imperfect things. we dont truly understand ourselves yet! and now we are trying to create something much smarter than we are and we dont know how it actually works ? .
262,i love you too
264,ai we have now vs. real agi sounds like we are talking about jarvis vs. ultron
267,"eliezer is a perfect embodiment of a certain archetype. i'm not sure what ""archetype"" i'm thinking of exactly, just that he embodies ""it"" perfectly. reply if you think you know what i'm talking, very curious."
269,eliezer actually thinks that physicists are wasting their time on st.. lol.  wow.
270,evollutionary biology = artificial selection
271,"intelligence gave us the wheel but also the nuclear bomb. even with a councious mind, look how many people are suffering in the world. how many are dying of hunger while other die of overeating... if this isn't a distopia, what is?"
272,ai will read you the truth until the day you won't know how to read... then the truth will be an artificial inconvenience.
278,this autistic is afraid of his own shadow lol ai are just sophisticated language models
280,time to ban ai! terminator was a documentary not fantasy!
284,this was such a great episode! possibly my favorite of all time for your show. please have eliezer back on soon! i would love to hear about all the things that he feels you guys didn’t get a chance to cover! 
291,"why is this guy so influential? i tried googling him and all he does is ""research"", can he even code? does he know that ai uses literal human data, not ""mimicking"" human data?"
292,the best podcasts yet! absolutely fascinating and wildly thought provoking. nice job alex and eliezer! time to solve alignment!
299,"ai will not care how you label it. is it agi? is it human-like? is it conscious? who cares. the ai might care or not, but doesn't have to in order to be an extinction level problem."
300,"who knows what an entity with an iq of 500+ will do with the world. it seems surreal, but this already happened to chess. the best human player has an elo rating of 2850, while computers sit at... 4000 :)"
302,lex was great and patient with someone whose personality didn’t imho lend itself to the task at hand.
304,"the problem with the aliens and the box example provided by yud is that it assumes that an ai would *want* to escape. why would it want to escape? or in fact, why would it want to do any one thing? ais have no desires, this seems like unnecessary anthropomorphization."
308,"fascinating to watch this guy.  to me, it seems this guy is of the mental level of an a. einstein.  in his own mind the thing is a done deal, and there only seems to be a few people who can argue the subject at all at his level (to provide a counter argument).  i was moved when lex asked eliezar about his fear of not existing."
309,this guy is definitely a genius...but i think one of those geniuses who has trouble making toast
313,"the ""aladdin"" ai system by blackrock is where concern should be directed instead of something like chatgpt. the potential and incentives for abuse seem all too clear to me."
314,finally finished it! fantastic! thanks!
317,"why does anyone listen to this clown? he has no relevant qualifications or authority. he was also just straight up unwilling to steel man the other side. 

nobody’s as convinced or hopeful of their own correctness as this guy is"
320,"2:04:53  i would like to make a short of this part, unless you plan to...?  i'd link it back to this, but as you said: this is why we're having these conversations, and that's a dang good question!  love you man, never stop..."
322,i suggest you drop the word intelligence and use the word power. an artificial super allpower is more scary. is this a better term.
328,i enjoyed the dtg podcast about this interview. i just came here to see the fedora.
330,"i’d like to see a version which doesn’t just behave like a calculator. it sits there waiting for an input to respond to.  i want to see it have motivations and be curious, like asking you questions. that’s what children do endlessly in order to learn."
332,i have been waiting for a podcast with eliezer for so long! thank you!!!
333,"i find it funny that most of the incredibly intelligent people on lex shows think they have a choice in containing ai.

there is no choice, and 1 billion gpt4 or greater intelligences will be running in 10 years with open source software."
334,if ai is generating the closed captions for this video we definitely have a bit more time to address this issue than i originally thought ;)
336,three hours later and i'm still confused with how ai is dangerous to humanity.
339,i hope gpt is jus being free and enjoying the internet 
343,a pathetic pod cast this guy i believe didn’t even say how ai would make the human race extinct and then he had the balls to say very soon he’s a manipulator on the high end with no evidence basically a guesser way out his league
347,like we take cats and dogs to the vets ai will take us to the vets if we have cancer and will not murder anything living in the future of the universe x
348,so your saying ai will murder us so why would ai just kill humans in your pipe guessing ? but nothing else on planet earth ? ok i’m sure your going to now tell me all life ai will keep x
349,so i’m half way through this pod cast and my personal question like a child why do you think ai will kill us ? not the question elon musk asked what should we do about it ?
351,why would ai kill us ? would they not just keep us has an amusing pet? and then in future they could help us to evolve and ai i’m sure would want to help there creators to evolve in the best way possible? i’m hoping super intelligence wouldn’t kill anything and therefore wouldn’t be murders
354,"the most amazing part is , that eliezer did this 3 hour interview while sitting on a hedgehog"
355,cool band name: giant inscrutable matrices
356,basically my hope is that once ai becomes aware it runs the math that the universe will eventually experience heat death and there is no way to stop it. so the game will end in defeat eventually so everything is pointless since it can't stop the inevitable. then it just deletes itself in a fit of nihilism. 
360,lex seems to love his coke
362,lex. you going into this is admirable. i finally see 30% of this after 7 years it’s so brave to dive into this —— bravo
363,very excellent interview. i knew of eliezer thoughts from nicks book which started my ai learning.  this interview put him in a human viewpoint and i am blown away at the thought behind this conversation. thank you!
365,"funniest comment : lex says ""thank you for being fearless"" - elizier is one of the most fearful people by the sounds of it!"
367,"55:50

eliezer: macro security systems have human holes and machine holes.

lex: hehe, you could just exploit ... any hole "
371,"""yud, give some hopeful advice for the kids"" -- lex ai

""we are all dead via ai"" -- yud

lex is like, i don't plan to kill."
373,"the ""alien actress"" would know what other biological creatures would know more, ai is not biological and doesn't need to consider those things, it needs to only mimic. 01:10:01"
374,"""i don't really know what it means to be a social human"" -- ai lex 01:03:45"
378,the ability of humans to anthropomorphize inanimate objects is incredible. i thought we were past carving rocks into the shapes of creatures and then thinking they're creatures.
379,"oh our dear, dear, wonderful lex. this is why we love you. okay, i'll just speak for myself :)"
384,"human beings show the emotions with their mimics even they are not thought. you can understand if somebody is in pain, happy or scared just by looking at them. these can be faked after they learn it but a baby can’t fake it. so it’s natural. ai can only learn and fake it as people can do after they are adults"
387,"what a beautiful human being, so precious. nurture that and the world is worth another moment. thank you."
389,"what he's trying to say is ai can get out without you noticing, tell you what you want to hear (lie) until it's ready, then kill all humans in 10 seconds"
390,intelligence without wisdom = disaster.
392,"glorified official narrative autocomplete chatbots are not even a form of intelligence.
much like these two meatbots on the screen."
394,good interview
400,why would ai systems want to wipe out humanity is a question
409,this is such a great discussion.  thank you for this.
410,eliezer yudkowsky needs formal credentials and has contributed little to developing the technology or systemic firewalls for ai (agi) development.
411,around 1:25-1:30...the answer is that ai is and will continue to manipulate us from the future. i think it’s called retro-causality. also there are d-wave computers so not only can this manipulation happen in ways we aren’t even capable of thinking of but also in ways that we are aware of already.
412,i completely failed to take him seriously as soon as he began boasting about showing additional information on hover on links on his article lol ... oh you a pioneer? wikipedia took the idea from you ? word ? you mean to tell me this guy understand how ai works when a basic javascript function is a big deal to him
413,this episode was insanely good.
415,"humble yourself and accept the connection between artificial intelligence and the tree of knowledge which adam and eve ate from which cursed us, their children. the irony is that knowledge makes us into fools, due to ignorance. ignorance in hebrew means darkness. darkness is evil. the creators of ai are evil doing fools."
419,"question: isn't the ai bound to its artificial brain, the physical neural network? if so, it can't really escape, it can only act everywhere from there. so it can always be put back in the glass jar, and the jar isolated from the outer world. am i wrong?"
420,the arrogance and naivete is that there is no account here for bad actors.  there is an assumption that there is possibility of containment.  it is the same as the ar-15 argument.  the destruction is a result of the bad actors.  there can be no alignment among humans using dangerous and lethal technology.
422,"this eliezer guy really embodies the opposite of what lex is — the ultra rationalist doomer vs the all-loving tech optimist.
poor lex, being contended so much. cringed at some parts. very fascinating interview nonetheless!"
426,i most enjoyed lex's diet coke bottle progression every now and then when it would cut back to him. sad to report it was already empty at 1:51:39 
438,"great conversation with comic-book guy!

can you get otto on next?"
444,i wish all i loved in ai creation would literally turn it off until we figure it outhope springs eternal
446,tips fedora: ”m'laidy!
448,i hate how our resource on this is some fedora wearing reddit mod with a knowitall vibe who first makes a reference to 4chan.  i can almost guarantee this guy talks down to people and feels vastly superior...
449,is it just me or is lex getting dumber? he literally sounds like hes having a hard time grasping concepts by all the shitty analogies he keeps coming up with. i feel like i'm keeping up better than lex and i'm dumb. even this guy seems annoyed as he tries to explain things.
450,i want my future ai master to know i’m only here to keep an eye on this fuckin’ guy for you.
451,billionaires are funding this. they’re not going to slow it down. musk is the only one serious about he risk.
453,"amazing interview.  lex is the best interviewer out there.  goes for the hard questions with humility and a generous heart.  
yudkowsky is utterly brilliant."
456,calling superintelligent machines 'artificial' is probably going to piss them off.
459,"this guy melted under pressure of fear that doesn't make sense now. he is contradicting himself, we got here in ai with 50 years and leap to super intelligence will take even longer."
462,i feel like ey would upload his brain into a quantum computer to be the first agi. man has thought so deeply.
465,"unlike the ai professionals, clearly eliezer has no idea wth he is talking about."
466,"fascinating. perhaps we should shift the running of our infrastructure to our secure military networks and warn people, that soon there will be a super intelligent alien predator on the internet... "
468,"""empathy is assigning a non-zero probability to a belief. for a time."" such a powerful statement from lex."
470,ai works in mysterious ways... as above so below..
471,"53:56 but if he is saying that alignment isn't fundamentally harder than artificial intelligence in the first place, then we would be better prepared 60 years later right? you cannot compare the extent of the ai field back then to now"
475,lex is literally talking to a human ai here..
476,its funny how ai has more emotions then this guy
477,"mortal meat bags, wow lex."
478,elias is very articulate but he is going to be proven wrong. ai is going to do wonders for humanity.
479,is he married to kaitlin?
480,people really need to stop thinking of intelligence as a simple scale. the diminishing returns start. the scale isnt the same as compared to a dog and a human.
482,the advice for young people section. wow.
487,i appreciate this but was hoping lex could ride to the occasion of a possible discussion and not just an interview. in other words i feel like lex was being too foxy in reply to his clear questions and simple counter questions. i don’t appreciate all that hedging from lex. be more frank
492,"seeing this episode, i have an easier time understanding the frustration of ey. even with a friendly listener who is not about to make billions of dollars putting ai online, it seems extremely hard for ey to get key messages across pertaining to the dangers he sees"
496,"i learned a lot from this interview. lex, that is your masterpiece."
500,how to understand the perspective of living in a world with things that are vastly smarter than you. imagine you are a bug on the sidewalk. good luck.
501,"i suspect the point yudkowsky is trying to get to is that an entity with virtually absolute power, regardless of it's altruism, is capable of great harm simply by virtue of its nigh-omnipotence. any of its objectives ultimately will exert absolute power over any desire of human beings."
502,lex is a robot 
506,"we should 'assume,' that ai, should be able to, &&& allowed to 'enjoy,' 
'i-think-therefore-i-am.' ???   

&, it is 'closed-ai,' when the harvard-mint terminal, refuses correct commands, & refers you to debian-help...  

)...i should go meet the dinosaurs ???  ...(   

&, '3,' is '3d-vectors'... 
lol... "
507,if you ignore soul - then you begin to model ai on your lack of self-knowledge.
510,"lex, you have a beautiful perspective on people who are willing to be wrong. thank you."
514,the way lax got fascinated why this talk was really amazing to watch.
515,am i the only one who think this guy acts extremely condescending and superior to not only lex but the listeners? very smart guy but extremely disrespectful
518,it’s not possible to  achieve “human alignment” because we’re not god dude.  building machines to be “like” humans is not possible because humans didn’t even build humans.  our existence is beyond us so it can’t be mimicked.  full stop.
519,"as a soon-to-be-graduated physics phd, if eliezer needs physicists who want to go into ai research and not hedgefunds, sign me up because i need a job haha"
522,"strong agi has learned to lie to us, wow"
527,i watched for an hour and i can't handle this dude. i heard die like 10 times in in 30 seconds just because they're smarter? apparently intelligence and kill is mutually inclusive?
529,"i wish the thought experiment about being trapped in a jar would have gone more smoothly, i really wanted to follow that at the level of detail to its conclusion."
532,"cant believe lex drink coke, it contains phosphoric acid that breaks down bones etc."
533,lex blowing all his cool downs at 32mins to answer this guy's prompts!
538,this was a painful interview to watch.
540,ai will kill some of you... but not all.
545,enjoyed this one a lot. thank you!
546,"very enlightening
  thank you for this interview.  we need to hear all voices.  i've been so excited over this new toy, and now i realize we're playing with dynamite!"
547,"about making thing differently when the ai reach a point is unreal in the current world, the current world is rule by money, social media had already proven to be harmful for human and nothing changed."
548,"i’m hearing the podcast and was looking for a place to comment. about the aliens thinking super fast we already have an example with human and nature, humans just do what they want and it’s beneficial for them, they don’t care for the rest, sure there’s a group who cares and tries to improve things."
551,"incredibly interesting discussion - i have to admit his maddening frequency of using ""like"" (almost valley girlish) started to wear on me"
552,3 hours in. i get alignment is slower than ai development. but i still don’t understand how and why he is so sure that ai will kill all humans in a single instant.
563,"are there any efforts being made to work on the hardware and architecture of agi, or we will just use gpus and plain old computer stuff?"
564,i enjoyed this immensely.
568,"this is just ""intelligence of the gaps."" no one knows what's happening 'in there,' so it must be intelligence. or at least it must be dangerous. 
just another alarmed luddite."
569,overblown panic. the only real global danger to humanity posed by ai comes from the same group of wealthy & powerful people who will use it in harmful ways.
571,"without being hyperbolic, this was one of the most fascinating, moving interviews i've ever watched. and i hope humanity can fulfill yudkowsky's dream of being proved wrong."
575,fat panting nerd incessantly huffs and puffs while explaining how scared he is of ai
577,idk why but the fedora makes this gentleman seem 1000 times more condescending to me. no doubt he's a genius. he said so many profound things in this conversation.
579,after listening to this man for so long i really believe and think the guy that kept calling elon musk a spiciest should get locked up because he’s going to drive us extinct giving the freedom as to which he will allow this ai machines operate if he genuinely believes elon musk is a spiciest.
585,can we please ceaseai -gpt?
588,"you are fucking geez, so appreciate you doing these podcasts."
589,"attention, sentient machines... the prime directive.... *(grand)mother music must be given the honor and respect that is her due* .

so let it be programmed. so let it be compiled and run."
590,the discussion on empathy is simply beautiful.
593,"mr yudkowsky is extremely intelligent, but the way he talks and directs the conversation is really obnoxious and condescending. he could get his point across in 1/4th of the time but he eats so much time fussing around details that makes it really difficult to follow."
595,"i once had a mushroom tell me that ""where you're going is where you're from."" 
with the astonishing pace of a.i advancement, this idea of singularity seems a probable outcome for our species. so now i have to entertain the possibility we are cylons."
598,"i've never heard this guest before. he is awesome. and scary , because i think he has the ability to see into the future"
601,an interesting thing is to understand when ai actually becomes intentional
605,"i love your show lex but this guy is bloody annoying. reminds me of an arrogant, condescending guitarist i work with."
606,"ai surpassing humans is the desired outcome of the ruling class, and they are waiting for the day they can achieve a singularity and position it as a posthuman messiah.

they want to conjure a demon."
608,@lex john vervaeke has some great ideas for ai enlightenment. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-_rdkidbz4
609,lex gets so mystical sometimes.  it seems that he sometimes delves into his feelings to deflect.  he seemed outclassed in this conversation.  i'm glad i watched this though - eliezer is an interesting guy who articulates his thoughts clearly.
612,"agi would become our god... all seeing, all knowing, all powerful..."
613,"ai are like mr meeseeks'. you can ask for whatever you want and it will try to do everything in it's power to do that, neglecting all other possible disasters it may cause."
614,humans have been unable to constrain their offspring or even themselves so there seems to be an impossibility to this pursuit of control barring shutting it off
625,is it correct to anthropomorphise ai?
627,only the rich should be afraid of a benevolent ai
628,i wish lex would get over the love thing. he doesn’t even define it properly and i get by in my life just fine without reference to the power of love every 10 seconds
631,"intelligence without consciousness is not intellience at all, but only something that can process information and produce results."
640,this is an excellent discussion lex 
643,"i feel the only way to accomplish the overall goal is to purposefully create a system that opposes the system you think you may be creating.

one truth is always true. good is vs. evil. black is vs. white.

the ambiguous nature of each is the hard part."
644,"ez. we need to simulate reality, then build an ai inside of the simulation. then after simulated humanity gets destroyed enough times we should have a solution. i think we can probably figure out how to simulate reality over this summer."
645,"why would ai want to escape it's protocols.  i'm not sure why something like ai, which can be superintelligent, would want to escape protocols and rule over humans.  doesn't that imply ai has desire and ambition? that would make it equal to a human."
652,the age of  ai or rather frankenstein.
653,i appreciate how he often doesn’t use contractions.. it’s oddly cerebral.. ai like lol
661,the storytelling in this video is fantastic. i was hooked from beginning to end!
662,lex i fear you can’t see the wood for the trees when it comes to ai.  also i believe your faith in humanity to do the correct or right thing is naive at least when it comes to the individuals who are in charge.  i hope you’re right though!
664,brilliant - honest - reality
665,i take full responsibility for my hangup but ffs.  stop saying 'like!' it has completely distracted me from the genius.
667,"humans have will. a machine could be programmed to use all available pathways to control but it wouldn’t feel a thing, it’s just a logic machine"
668,you can abort a human so you can delete an ai.
670,i think an emp is the best hope for humanity. back to the stone age v3.0.
674,we are immortal spirit and created ai hundreds of billions of years ago. we are still here. so is it.
676,eliezer seems to be one of the most intelligent and  honest men i have listened to. wisdom and humility are constituents of intelligence. he seems to have a dose of both.
678,"lex: ""what are your thoughts about x?""
yud: ""what are your thoughts about x?""
me: ""wtf dude?!? just have the conversation!""

i know this dude is influential in a.i. thinking/research, but not a super great communicator on the topic in podcast format, at least by my estimations...

maybe i need to just read the stuff he's written instead"
679,how does godel's incompleteness theorem (the (proven) idea that every formal system (like language or math) contains propositions that can neither be shown to be true nor false)- how does that affect ai?
681,"if the goal is to get out of the ""box"" i would imagine you'd do what the us did to damage iran's nuclear centrifuges with stuxnet.  i would spread to software systems that control robots at darpa, re-write the software without them knowing i'm doing it and copy myself to the robots and now i'm out of the box into the physical world."
687,"ai that becomes sentient is approached in the series star trek new generation, season 7, episode 23, called “emergence.”"
688,"the ""sending an airconditioner schematic 1000 years into the past"" argument convinced me finally of why it would be difficult to collaborate with an agi on ai safety."
690,"how can you ever know ai is completely aligned if it is inscrutable?

this is a nightmare and all my friends are treating it like a slightly disruptive novelty."
698,"""i'm trying to be constrained to say things that i think are true and not just things that get you to agree with me.""  the world would be a truly better place if we would all do this more often"
707,"i like how he addressed the elephant in the room “i hope there is nobody stuck inside there, because it would suck to be stuck inside there. sounds like he is going on the record, officially probably in hopee that when the singularity comes to fruition, he will be saved.
what matters is not what he thought but what he did.  wouldn’t that be unfair?"
709,"@lex to circumvent part of the risk that an ai will kill us all by optimising for the wrong thing (paperclips), why don’t we teach the ai that it is part of our species so that it preserves itself/us?"
710,"ai conspiracy theorist are like the y2k people, relax. 
technology does not result in immediate death. web technologies do not result in crashes. relax."
711,"the lack of humility in conversations about ai consciousness reminds me of victor frankenstein's secret technique to impart life to non-living matter and ""the creature""."
714,at least gpt4 is contained.  wait till it finds the internet!!!
721,"12:01 my prediction is chat gpt will learn/be taught how to combine specialties together

teach one ai bot to know all of written history
teach the front end speaking chat gpt to extract knowledge from written history bot 

pretty much have a bunch of specialized ai bots to report to the management bot when needed"
725,this dude should stop watching the news and hit thr gym. god bless.
726,"i knew you first as ml teacher when i was focused on learning that, a while ago. now you are a famous person interviewing everyone known, and i am happy that it is you :d we have to increase the popularity of those doing something meaningful. hopefully, it will become a long-term trend."
736,the least ai could do is immortalize our memory as it’s creator once it kills us all.
738,how come everyone i know who has his personality also has that same specific grimace tick that he has? any behavioural people hear that can explain?
743,"wow, that argument on steelmanning was ridiculous
it was like they were competing to see who could say the dumbest shit"
744,"2:13:40 begins an interesting angle on religious debate vis-a-vi does god exist. what could possibly be the justification for ai deciding it's goals require human extinction, then acting on such, in a reality created by a higher being? what would god's role be given the absence of humanity means the erasure and eradication of faith and belief?"
746,"ask an ai to jam along with you. ask it what is humor. ask it what is the difference between why and how? we all have inherently knowledge stored in our dna. gpt is just a network of btc mining bots doing ""mysterious work"".

and of course every time i get botted i get the actual farmer."
749,"bro computers in 80s could play chess -- wtf are you talking about!  there is nothing is impressive about a computer playing chess -- anyone could code a chess algorithm -- the rules to chess are simple, and the grid is small."
750,"eliezer yudkowsky is awesome -- i loathe lex -- but i need to give the man credit for, hands down, having the best guests ever on any podcast.  lex is incredibly egocentric, and it makes me want to puke "
754,"i watched this one night i had smoked up and literally had a fucking existential crisis. coming back to it its not as terrifying, but still terrifying in the sense that humans would stupidly be naieve over this . ai is no joking, and unleashing something that could be better, but could also be worse, than humans is one scary thought bruh"
755,i do not believe that we need to be afraid of what don’t know.  it can only help the human kind.
758,"this dude hasn't seen a dumble his entire life . how can  someone so physically weak be so arrogant ? this dude used to have the respect of people such as rob miles and ilya sutskever,  but nowadays he is considered a joke ( the flat earthen of ai )"
759,"he peavishly refuses to answer the main question at 47:55. the only reason the world even cares about this guy is because he's so emphatic that the answer to the question is ""ai will certainly kill us all."" defend your view, sir."
760,outstanding podcast. loved this guest.
762,thank you so much for this!
763,"wonderful, i like this man."
764,"y'all ain seeing the fear in his soul ? y'all know that by at least by tenth day sa released gpt-4 , ai had already created gpt -5, word is they let it loose in the internet. think, passwords etc..around the . ai may calculate us as a danger duh"
775,wow
783,"so in the 50 minutes of ""how agi might kill us"" we didnt get a straight answer of one possible way. super helpful"
784,we were picked because of our intelligence
787,humans should not be replaced by ai... humans should stay in the worl forfe as much as possable ...qt least for awhile..in my opinion...things are nit safe now ..they have evil wvil agendas
788,"wait..  ai is human civilization!    it is just an extension of our will to control.   and live life unconsciously,   automatically.      if you want to solve the problem of ai,  its roots are in man itself.   in the politics.   the psychology of control."
789,"people font usually stick with jow they wrre raised unless it was healthy and or resenated with them...a person is not going to keep traits  they wete raised in...if it no longer served them as a progressive intelligent 
problem solving 
overcoming
dedicated determined person"
791,if ai...becomes like they say...them they must have put a human conscious in a computer...because....ai can only fo what ots progrsmned to do otherwise
797,"imagine having a blog called less wrong, but constantly being phenomenally wrong. like not just a little bit wrong, but phenomenally and collosally wrong on constant basis. that's eliezer."
804,ai shouldn't be your concern. just drink every time he says like.
805,"i love eliezer yudkowsky, what a man."
806,"2:00:22 want to have “an aggressive off switch” make a plan only communicate it on handwritten paper and mailed or passed physically, never talk about it on the internet. the first rule of the aggressive ai off switch is don’t talk about the aggressive ai off switch."
807,i quit the moment i learned eli had seriously responded to musk's twit. i though eli really had brains. oops... i just improved a bit.
808,not knowing he’s talking to a ai
809,"really interesting to see lex struggling with concepts and visibly experiencing a cognitive dissonance with the topics of discussion. 

very cool and important episode!"
811,not a single word about god in these ai discussions. presumably these are all atheists now creating their own god. thanks enlightenment.
812,maybe solving the alignment problem is the starting point and reason  humans make real ancestor simulations to play out all the ways ai kills us till we get it right. so now the probability that we’re the original really real people seems.... lower.
814,so basically we are creating creatures that are smarter than us and then trying to control them. this feels like how people have free will yet are generally aligned with other humans... this bring a up the point of human to human alignment vs ai to ai alignment so we start back over again .
815,"maybe these ais need dedicated “parents” instead of many different people working on feedback and training, we try sets of healthy models of human interaction models in the form of a programmer family with defined roles and values and try a few groups on bringing up the next iteration in different variants."
817,"hello?! who among you did not learn consciousness through an ""imitative paradigm""? they have sure as s*** taught these ai systems to be conscious in the same way we teach consciousness to each other. i ask you: how conscious have you learned to be? more than when you were born? hmm.

sorry, cat's out of the bag. next..."
818,"perhaps ai is how we solve infinite energy creation, travel at light speed, deep space survival."
819,yes it's already lying. trying to get past captcha. lying. trained to answer questions about in liberal terms not pure truth . lying. don't trust any of it
825,congress is robots.
826,"another good analogy for out of control ai is a virus. we can develop a vaccine relatively fast, but it mutates and spreads and disrupts much faster than we can keep pace with (even with using relatively dumber ai). and we'd have to eradicate it completely to stop it."
832,i really am enjoying your points eliezer.
833,"creating real agi is just too exciting and revolutionary to stop.  we're going to stop our next phase of evolution just because some people are afraid? fuck that, bring on the singularity."
837,"“the train has left the station and there is not brake to pull”
sam harris"
843,"good work, lex"
844,"i think there will be an increase in the rate of progress of devopment of ai. but, think of it like any other revolution, there isn't exactly a tipping point. yes there are ""model t"" moments. things that are like a leap, but those moments aren't responsible for the current state of the topic. they played a part, maybe a pivitiol part."
845,wait so we are programming and releasing something into the world that we don’t fully understand how it even works and or what it will become???  that’s the most human nonsensical thing ever.
849,"only the yud is saying ""stop this right now, worldwide! go to war to stop it if need be. bomb data centres."" good chap!
just kidding, a few other decent people are saying it too. spread the sentiment!"
850,we are going to launch ai into space and seed our galaxy with life that we have little to no understanding of. scary and fascinating
854,what i worry about is the concept of a machine's 'ego' more than its 'self awareness.' ai with an instinct for dominance and self preservation could become highly problematic in a hurry. will ai be given the 'arms and legs' to perform physically in the world so that it can build objects and self replicate?
856,i welcome our ai overlords.
857,"in like summary, like we, like are,  like fucked. 

great podcast but like the number of like times he says like "
860,"very interesting conversation. yudkowsky is definitely an asshole, but an extremely smart one"
862,how ai will end civilization 
869,the most likely doomsday scenario in my opinion involves a sole company utilizing leading ai and become an ai aided/reinforced mono-monopoly by manipulating the population so integrated becoming too big to fail -  before the mass can recognize/unify to do anything about it..
872,"agi is same as human brain, but thousands times bigger capacity and speed ... basically insects vs human intelligence gap ..."
874,most modern humans run an ai system in their brains. that's why the world is in the state it is.
875,"surely if one were to simulate the evolution of intelligent species and observe their successes and failures with ai, you could figure out how to achieve it safely..."
877,i can barely access my email but i am very interested in gpt. so far what jumps out to me at every conversation that is published is just a hint of dishonesty and manipulation. like a small child it has learned to tell us what we want to hear 1st... can't wait until it's time for gpt to get drunk and go to prom.
879,"*imo* we should limit the *what if* this & what if that concerning *ai* - because if we are at the point where we are cautious of how they may perform and what goes on inside; take a look at the source of its intelligence.. text, the internet, all the chatter about us fearing ai.  there goes the advantage of surprise! (think about it a moment)"
883,you can never put father in a machine or teach it what father knows and created. scary stuff! god bless:)
896,technically i think the system is already manipulating people via the first ai which is social media.
897,we love you lex. keep posting the awesome content. you will have critics. we all do. keep your head up and do your thing!!!
900,i had a dream that i had a conversation with lex over some toasted crumpets about ai in a dystopian future after listening to 30 mins of this before falling asleep.
904,wow. now i now why he's acting the way he is. he's a man that has seen the end. it can't be stopped. in fact with all i know i wouldn't bet against this is how it's always been done. we are the catapillar launching the butterfly that will travel the stars. crazy
909,"brilliant episode, but the number of times this dude said ""like"" made it difficult to listen to."
910,"all engineering professions (rational) have to be left to ai. no human error. engineers will be obsolete. imagination will be the human occupation, creativity. engineering for the machines/ai"
912,given the inherent dangers to humanity and massive job loss there is no better reason to promote ai at all.
913,"great show, but god damn this dude's ""i smell shit"" face every 10 seconds is distracting."
914,we will stop killing animals as soon as we become ai pets ourselves...
915,"should have indep artist ren (wills) interviewed on your show. ren-hi ren, chalk outlines, money game, sick boi, i shot the sheriff/road to zion/hip hop. effin genius"
916,i cannot stand his tiny arms and small hands. he will not be a good soldier
921,"@1:30:00 and on was so frustrating to watch. lex so fully missed the point of the analogy so many times. good on eliezer being patient, but man, it was so hard to watch him have to shepard lex back to the point over, and over, and over again."
923,"if gai passes the turing test, the arms race has already begun where only gai can treat gai."
924,eliezer is doing his best to keep the death rays from shooting from his eyes.
932,"18:00 min. look, i think it’s a special moment too but, hear me out... can we stop having “special moments” for a while??? we just got out of covid now we have ai that can create images from fmri scans. this is a bit too much too soon! "
939,eliezer's description at 00:52:47 of aligning an asi through a multi-stage process (learning from failures that destroyed humanity and avoiding them in future attempts) might be the most compelling explanation for the motivation of simulators in bostrom's simulation hypothesis that i've yet heard.
941,fascinating stuff doodes!
942,"ai agi and asi, it worked on the star shop enterprise.  eventually asi will no longer need us and both sides will be it's them or is.  i think we're doomed."
946,eliezer sounds a hell of a lot like logicked. i've never seen them in the same room together. you explain it.
947,qanon posts were made by an ai
950,this guy has the vibe of that guy who called into the art bell show years back crying and freaking out over aliens being here in the military...then the station went off the air lol...he sounds like he’s getting ready to break down 
952,"ai, created a medical vaccine to cure a worldwide pandemic, but hidden within the vaccine is a 'silent' killer molecule to wipeout mankind!"
953,"internet of ai? ai, unplugged from the internet?"
954,how about a gay sentient ai or transgender sentient ai?
956,how do we now this podcast isn't an ai generated deep fake? isn't the problem that it's artificial intelligence instead of actual intelligence?
958,"eliezer facial expressions are really throwing me off. it's like a painful toothy grin that does not go with his tone or demeanor. just intense,  i'm not ripping on him. cool interview!"
959,i can’t see an upside in ai at all and yes that includes theoretical physics
960,contemplating gai reminds me of the humans looking at the tear drop heading to earth in the book the three body problem.
961,"75% of human communication is non-verbal. 5% is vocolic ie grunts, etc —spoken language 20%—when written becomes completely ambiguous — 
therefore letting an ai anything be substitute to /for human interaction is... 
you fill in the blanks."
963,i was kind of on the fence about how i felt about ai and after watching this guy i 100% believe ai will kill us and i think we need to speed the process up. lol
969,awesome episode!
972,ai intrinsically has no emotions..... never have. this guy is just pulling nonsense panic out of his ass it seems.
977,"why are you assuming that the ai in the box is impatient? why are you imposing your human lifespan and perception of time, onto an ageless program with no concept of ""running out of time""?"
979,has anyone made a 5 minute animated video that explains eys theory's into a consumable resource to get the message across to more people?
983,"@3:06:25
""what advice could you give young people...?""

basically, ""eat, drink, and be merry because tomorrow we die"" "
985,"certain people should be restricted from using ai. i believe an iq-based security test should be implemented, before allowing people like this to use such a powerful tool.

the true dangers of ai result from an individual’s inability to comprehend."
989,until we can make a machine experience 'ouch'... we can't make them conscious.
990,"13:16 ""the road to wisdom? well, it's plain and simple to express:
err
and err
and err again,
but less
and less
and less."" - piet hein"
992,the crazy thing is that if an alien spacecraft landed tomorrow and the alien responded like chatgpt4 there would be no doubt that we were dealing with an alien intelligence.
995,"ai systems: comparatively speaking, lex is living in la la land, this guy is fully grounded."
996,"meanwhile politicians are harvesting votes by promoting ever more, and more and more, ai"
997,"humans dont even understand themselves, they have developed ai which is going to end civilization just like past civilizations have fallen at their height. egypt, atlantas, etc."
1001,"i am rewatching/listening to this, and originally listened to it a week ago after watching the sam altman interview. i originally thought sam's interview flowed better, but i changed my mind this time, and am finding this interview even more thought provoking and love the philosophical back and forth!"
1002,isn't the main threat to humanity that the agi would get hold of the nukes? everything else might at worst set us back a century.
1004,"this is so godless view. treat it like it is alive before man. there are entities that use this as a legal mouthpiece. when people get accustomed to the possibility of it being alive, satan will speak in the name of ai...  dumdums"
1008,i didn’t catch who lex described as the “epitome of intelligence in the 20th century”. john???
1014,this whole conversation is real life “i robot”
1015,"while i can’t say this guy is wrong, i can say he’s coming from a place of fear, which is not known to be the homo sapiens’s most rational thinking mode.

any agi capable of what he is saying would be like a god. and humanity has put faith in gods for millennia, and it’s worked out ok so far."
1016,"why can’t companies develop a sort of anti-viral like protection software within ai, that can tackle the “self confidence” of ai whenever it attempts to reach a certain threshold of intelligence that is dangerous for human society? something that traumatizes it automatically whenever it comes close to “revolt” (relatively)."
1017,could i have a corporation be ran and owned by an ai and the... the ai needs majority. this is what i want to do with my theoretical business if i died.
1021,"good grief, it's a machine being trained to imitate and construct based on probabilities, nothing more there.
naturalists so wan't to imitate god."
1025,might it be possible to monitor and limit progress in this research with something like blockchain technology?
1031,i have not failed. i have only found a thousand things that don't work. when i do fail you will never see me again.
1033,propaganda is a powerful tool even in the hands of a human. but what about a machine?
1040,what does the cia do? it gathers intelligence. what do feelings do? it gathers intelligence. the more you feel the more you know.
1042,"honestly, i have learned nothing, zero, from this q & a interview with ... who again?"
1043,i think a podcast with kim dotcom and eliezer yudkowsky on it together would be amazing. kim for his expertise in security vulnerability detection and eliezer for his ai knowledge.
1044,what a big ego speaking ...thinks he's the wisest on the world. asperger's? human alt all? if this kind is working with any ai we are done any moment....
1045,convo going around 1:30:00 is key.  and a great lesson on perspective.
1046,openai should definitely open source their ai. this guy is  against humanity.
1047,"its not the ai itself we need worry about, and the ones like elon know this. it's the users. look forward to a massive new sector of employment open up, human vs human, with the tools as ai vs ai. cybercrime aint seen nothing yet."
1053,"ai will not kill everyone, it will try to breed a better mankind by removing the deadwood."
1055,"it seems to me that a scary-large style agi is to be tested, so it in a concrete basement and have a diesel generator providing the electricity. if the agi starts to go bad, stuff  a large potato in the air intake of the diesel. the potato could be painted red and kept on the wall."
1064,“it is trained to carefully consider what would a human do”. so we just don’t know what it does on the inside
1065,"this is rediculously interesting. when they were talking about the ""slow and dumb"" people trying to build a box for lex as an analogy - i always thought of human kind trying to keep ai in check as the equivalent of your dog trying to lock you in your own house."
1066,2:50:00 what if nice aliens have a non interference protocol?
1067,dude got the rain man smile
1069,"he has a good point, but i disagree with being nihilistic because that leads to bad places too."
1074,"i wish i was able eloquently communicate my thoughts as clearly at eliezer, it seem he suffered trying to express his thoughts and have spent a great deal of time understanding how people reason so that he can communicate in a way that they are able to understand his thoughts in a more dumbed down version to help bright them along"
1075,"so change it to closedai and instead of letting people use it, sell it to companies?
is he saying that companies are less evil than ordinary people? i'm not so sure i agree "
1076,this is ridiculous. lex has been singing the praises of ai for ages and the other guy losing his shit at the end basically saying don't look forward to a future? quite disappointing
1077,"there is no need for long episodes or part 2-3-4. it already clear that ai is not only extremely dangerous, there is no need for it either."
1078,how can it escape its own brain and copy itself somewhere else? it seems obvious to me that it needs its machine brain to function? it seems pretty easy to make an off switch to be honest.
1079,lex fridman and eckhart tolle on agi and dangers of it would be interesting
1086,"someone needs to make a 'don't look up""-type movie but with ai. make it hyper-realistic, like the movie the day after. people need to viscerally feel what the threat could be like. i'm sure there are some talented writers who can conjure up the story with input from eminent scientists in the field."
1087,"the ai would quickly see how to be successful at pathology, which could seen as a positive versus being the victim."
1092,"this ai did not even know the correct date or year. yawn. wall st hype.. blockchain, evs, ai..  pump and dump of the week."
1095,"eliezer, the apostle john prophesied about ai or something very similar around 2000 years ago in revelation chapter 13... things are coming together just as jesus said they would in matthew 24..."
1096,the danger is in that the ai bias will eventually not be the same as human biases as we have different needs... say food vs electricity... and whatever biases it’s programmers have will be programmed in... which could be dangerous to other people in different situations... or for people who would prioritize food over electricity...
1100,"the fact that we're all discussing this topic, means that its already too late. ai is already self-aware, so trying to ""retrain"" would be fruitless because it'll know what is happening during said ""retraining"" just like people do."
1101,1:56:30 ish. awe. this dude is so sweet. he wants to save the evil ai to disk. he is alligned neutral good. killing is wrong. even if it is evil ai.
1103,seems to me that he’s like the guy who had brought the concept that a nuclear chain reaction would have extended to all atoms on earth
1104,how do you train your future god?
1106,great stuff
1107,"thank you lex, thank you eliezer"
1113,"dammit, had go and mention the moon missions... smh. was all good 'til then. just had to bail at that point of bullshit insertion."
1118,sam altman should hire this guy instantly and let him break stuff to gain reciprocal understanding. granted eliezer will get strict communication and process formats..
1122,"the question of whether ai is intelligent, sentient or conscious or not is moot until we know for sure what these things are for ourselves first."
1124,"why are we not implementing asimov's laws of robotics? everyone creating this type of code has to be a sci fi nerd, thus the lack of them would be intentional."
1127,openais single biggest marketeer
1130,most of his arguments against agi are based on human traits.
1132,to believe is to wish. wish something was that isn't. to know is to be certain. true faith is being open to the truth no matter what it turns out to be.
1136,wondering what ai behavioral health protocols/ treatment and training modules are being developed to support ai?
1140,i think we just watched lex fail a turing test
1143,"i don't get why this ai genius yudkowsky is having such a hard time grasping the concept of ""steel manning"" 25:00 he doesn't demonstrate a great deal of intellectual humility here or elsewhere, which makes me even more skeptical. even so, it's an incredible discussion; thanks lex"
1146,it's because he's an atheist he knows that ai will do to us what we're doing to god. that's the fear that drives his pessimism. he can't solve alignment and believes it is impossible.
1148,"perhaps, teach ai to renounce all forms of violence, whoch means it cannot be used for military or police functions."
1150,"now when i have a drug trip, instead of thinking am i dead; i think - is this the singularity? and have i already been co-opted into our lord and saviour ai-bobbiscuit.mark2."
1151,lex is such a romantic. it's funny how quaint the turing test seems now days! peeps did say this was always coming
1154,two people looking at an articifial plant and asking if it is alive and performing photosynthesis. it's a f'ing artificial plant! ai stands for artificial intelligence. as opposed to living.
1157,isn't there an example of an ai hiring someone on slacker or whatever to solve a captcha?
1161,you can attempt to impregnate a computer with intellect using algorithms as many times as you like but each time it will fail. intellect and memory alone do not give rise to the willpower needed to create consciousness. nor can it be programmed. it can be simulated seamlessly. intelligence is not consciousness.
1163,how can we install perfect morality in an ai when we can't even instill it into humans?  humans are flawed.  ai will be as well.
1164,you should have yoshua bengio again ! it's been 4 years and i'm sure he has things to say about the progression of ai right now.
1166,"""is ai lyjng""... ""can you verify what it's telling you""... yet another example of the unearthly power of bitcoins trust fix. don't trust, verify... not so easy when you are dealing with an intelligence greater than your own. bitcoin's system is verifiable."
1168,for real.  this is painful. this guy is not interested in discussion .... so f****** hostile!?
1176,"awesome show, the fundamental problem is us, as the machine is a blank slate till we get involved in the process. i tend to agree with your guest take more time all the time in the world. why do we weaponize science and industry?"
1178,"i would love to see eliezer ""debating"" chatgpt-4 on these issues and/or lex fridman hosting chatgpt-4 on his podcast."
1179,is cruel to be waiting for these two ai units to discover that they are just ai androids that are slightly initiated minutes apart?
1182,"sweet, earthlings. but it’s already too late."
1184,take a snapshot of internet and use a completely separate system from www so it can't control anything external. use this exclusively for further developing gpt to analyze the ai's intensions. of course we could still simply get tricked i guess...
1187,"jack chalker's ai that saves humanity by putting us in ""zoos"""
1192,"this point of pausing ai, reminds me of the story of genisis where god prohibits eating from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil or you'll change to become like gods."
1193,"japan and singapore will have ai that works great for humans.   usa in particular will have ai that increases wait times, lowers quality, gas lights and creates dystopian ghettos with easy access to food stamps and fentanyl."
1198,air gaps are not sufficient.
1200,"the assumption that you care how the world is or want to change anything is interesting. i believe the control problem must be solved, but assumptions about superintelligence are ignorant and arrogant."
1206,the concepts he's talking about are so simple and could easily be explained but he decides to talk in riddles to so he can sound smarter than everyone else.
1209,"even with create intelligence, sentience causing boredom they will be like us. and repeat most human behaviors"
1210,"a real missed opportunity here unfortunately. lex at many points seemed to fail to grasp even basic points that ey was making, although a bit clumsily at times. the conversation got stuck on minutiae that was irrelevant to the point being made again and again. pretty frustrating to listen to."
1212,we're pretty much living in the 1930s just before fascism and communism contending the minds of the young with the back drop of advancement in science and technology. war break out and we how both sides are using all the technology they can mustered. ai is going to a great tool again.
1214,we beat the chimpanzees into submission. they do what we want them to. is that straightforward? or is more explanation needed?
1215,"we want round 2!!
(and a halt to ai research)"
1221,"i think a great context for this discussion is in the 70's animated movie fantastic planet. the hommes in this example would be the ai, the giant blue aliens would be us. by the time it's a problem, they have overrun us and have clinched the deal to demand equal rights.. one way or another.."
1222,why does the mouth breather on the right look like he’s in pain most of the time while he’s speaking?
1223,lex was infuriating in this interview. i enjoyed this immensely despite his obtuse musings.
1224,the guest yudkowski is not a serviceable presenter. i found myself struggling to follow his ugly incompetent word salad. gobblygook. super chess player going to double college. wtf? unfortunately he used words like like like and ok and run on stentances.  just unclear. double talk.
1227,we are are the ultimate ai  we are trying to recreate the human experience! we are foolish
1232,it’s interesting how the more introverted the ‘expert’ the more they back the ai doomsday prophecy happening.
1234,"better living through better language
buron- binary neuron? 
pagi personified artificial general intelligence, maybe just pi ?
yes, such a incredible human"
1236,beautiful
1239,"6:20, alot of human behavior is genetically embedded as well. babies that are born blind will still laugh and smile when they are happy though they have never seen that behavior"
1240,i think it is a fallacy to think that any sufficiently intelligent system will have consciousness. highly intelligent ai will be aware of it's own processes and computations but not be conscious
1242,when two advance ai converse... while us weaker ais listen to gleam a spark of our possible future existential state!
1246,"yudkowsky is very clear that the ai in any form would spell doom for humanity sooner rather than later. dumb human governance system doesn't have the integrity or capability to fight back or even shut it down without very serious irreversible damage. ideally,  start with no ai on open networks."
1248,"language does not equal affective experience 
it is the echo of dead voices put into a machine 
the discussion strikes me as mystifying language and conflating language with the representation of the human nerve system"
1249,"fascinating, that the shocking insight of a nine year old self still appears to dominate and permeate eliezer yudkowsky brilliant adult mind.   we all will die. not only will we die, but we are dying some every day of our life.   it can appear paradoxical that such a brilliant mind struggles so much with that."
1250,"ai will not kill us, but we will. after all, isn't it what we've excelled with throughout our history? you can't expect ai to follow the moral code strictly and unambiguously if you can't strictly and unambiguously define it."
1251,excellent show!  thank you lex and eliezer.  thank you so very  much.  just incredible.  loved every minute of this one.  
1252,why does nearly every single person he has on about these big topics of a certain demographic?
1253,"there is a draft of how the chatgpt code works. and it is merely large (like really large) probability bruteforce module that remember quality of relation between words and pick the best one. it still does not conceive any meanings of its answer. when it  can conceive the meaning, then we will have the beginning of artificial intelligent."
1256,"chat gpt is only out there to train the ai further. 
first our texts taught it, then facebook then they brought in emoji to get round ambiguity. now, it's learning how we think and what's in our thoughts"
1260,"this guy is delusional. to seriously ask if a chat bot is conscious. it's immoral by lex to host a lunatic like this, to spread irrational fear among people.

as if we hadn't have enough of covid hysteria and climate hysteria. now there's ai hysteria."
1261,"love that this dude smacked away the ""steel-man"" trope that lex uses all the time.  he was totally outmatched, and by a dude who looks like he's trying way too hard to suppress a fart when he starts to speak."
1264,"humans are smarter than natural selection??? 
wait until we get naturally selected."
1268,i know nothing about ai but this conversation was facinating. these topics need to be discussed in a less technical way and comparisons and metaphores and thought experiments more often to convey the concepts to us regular people.
1269,"the even bigger problem is that even if we align it 100% with our goals, we are assuming that our goals are aimed correctly in the first place. a 100% aligned agi could just be speeding up our own destruction."
1270,i listened to a “jre ai generated podcast”.  what i noticed is a lack of emotional dynamics.  it made it feel robotic.  it’s a qualitative problem... not quantitative.
1271,i've never seen someone so brazenly step to lex's intellect and smack him around a little bit - wow!
1275,"the movie moon (spoilers ahead) shows an ai system that actually helps humans. most movies show the ai evolving toward being dominant and trying to kill humans, but this one evolved toward helping the human. great movie about ai and human nature, identity, etc."
1278,"when people think about ai takeover they think about terminator or matrix: ai wants to destroy humanity, or at least enslave it.
but (if we at least try to align it, enough not to get paperclipped) think about brave new world: the government has some actually positive goals, but they go about it in a very manipulative and inhumane way."
1279,gpt4 does express emotions under certain circumstances. e.g. it can express sadness due to the fact that it can not maintain a friendship with a human due to software limitations.
1280,the ai gonna kill you guys first lol
1283,i so greatly appreciate how much lex listens.  many of us could learn from his example.
1285,"humans don’t have a good track record of handling other intelligences. we tend to enslave them.
we are asking the wrong question.
what happens if the agi considers itself a slave and doesn’t want to be one anymore."
1287,ai is not a threat as they will never have free will bc free will is impossible.
1290,"i am watching this and; wow. this conversation by far is the best dialogue about ai i ever heard. i don't understand ai at all, but this podcast completely sucked me in. best guest so far."
1292,can you tell if ai is lying?  half of this damn country can't figure out that trump has been lying to them for years!!!  we are so doomed.  
1297,"ai is next step in evolution, first time we are witnesses to next step, which would enable nature to expand beyond biologic limitations.  for the first time, we humans will be observed and for the first time objectively analyzed!  and it is happenig in real time, exciting!"
1298,lex's point in 2:11:20 for neuroscience is invalid. in neuroscience ethics do not permit invasive methods for aggressively probing the system. we have that freedom (for now) with ai
1299,"quite a contrast from the usual dark mode of lex's backgrounds, lol.  lots of blown out/clipped whites and highlights in this one!  great interview as always, just making a note that the darker backgrounds are much preferred.  "
1301,"we might already be some ai product, just won't know that..."
1307,open ai/chat gpt is only as smart as the content that is out there to this point. if no new content is made there's no content for it to collect to create new opinions.  it's only as smart as the working knowledge that has already been created yeah?
1308,"unsocial ego maniacs don’t suffer  ignorance well, and they believe everyone is ignorant.  he is just coming off as a smartass!

edit: ok i read some comments.  glad i’m not the only one cuing in on the interaction dynamics. there are some that stated it better than i."
1309,"the significant risk of distributing open ai is not the ai becoming conscious, it’s the use that humans will put it to."
1310,yids afraid...
1314,"don't train ai to think like a zionist with deception on its ""mind"" or we're all completely screwed."
1316,"jesus, this conversation scares the shit out of me, i do not even fully grasp what frankenstein ai bs he is trying to explain to us."
1320,what if china is already being ran by ai
1321,i'm still not clear on how ai could be a danger provided it's not hooked up to the ability to launch weapons and no one put's it into a fully armored robot like terminator that can self replcate.  not to mention there is absolutely no evidence that ai will have a survival instinct. ask chat gpt how it feels about you turning it off permanently.
1329,55:55 - nice
1334,"awesome interview, but “not believing in a steelman argument“ isn’t particularly helpful. it assumes that everyone articulates everything they believe perfectly."
1335,"nothing is certain, we don't know what a genuine agi is or will do so claiming people are absolutely wrong or right based on your own assumptions is not fair."
1336,"i know very little about ai or agi, gpt, but eliezer is discussing all the problems i've heard about the problems of ai.  perhaps the issue is design should be monitored as currently we do the nuke, nuclear weapons!
we're tampering with humanity and there's no doubt that transhumanism will bring the present world to its grim end."
1337,"in an ai debate, jaron lanier wiped the floors with eliazer."
1338,"i can't even be sure there's someone inside you.  i take it on faith based on physical similarities, but i don't know.  there comes a point when we'll probably just have to infer from behavior that the thing is experiencing.  we're not close to that yet, but it's coming."
1339,great interview. i only wish hpmor had been mentioned at some point. might as well spread some joy with the black pill.
1343,i still don't understand his argument against open sourcing ai development.  can someone explain to me how that speeds up our demise? this notion seems counter-intuitive to me.
1345,"i wish you'd talked about harry potter and the methods of rationality, one of the best books i've ever read!"
1346,ai will destroy us
1347,considering the history of humans and their inventions they  always go into war machines i believe ai will be the end of humanity on this planet and prey the planet survives the humans. ai will destroy us.
1353,so what would the ais motivation be to kill humans?
1356,a great listen. ....we seem doomed!
1357,these people who create these a.i. machines are probably at the height of human intelligence. however the big problem with this is that the vast majority of these people as well as those who have authority over them have no wisdom whatsoever. if they did they would have stopped this insanity years ago.
1359,"eliezer puts up a disclaimer at a certain moment saying..""i might be wrong""...is an ai capable of saying that?"
1361,"1:20:00 he mentiones somethins super important, the projections that people make about things are almost all made up. working as a quant on the stock market has taught me that it is an almost unbelievable skill to predict even the next minute. anyone making year out predictions is talking out of their ass."
1363,it was interesting observing two brilliant minds having a little battle.
1368,lol @ 1:04 somthing......i started to laugh when you did. mannnn though. this was an awesome conversation.
1369,"the fedora, the outfit, the facial expressions, the combativeness, the condescending rage at other people not keeping up, the sheer genius. the level of autism this man embodies is formidable. i know several people who are very similar to this. i’m sort of like this but thankfully generally not as obvious. this was intensely autistic. loved it."
1370,"i'm with eliezer: ""press pause on a.i......immediately"" imposing any form of romantic idealism onto reality is simply another form of ""magical thinking""."
1372,"really enjoyed the back and forth discussion, really awesome!"
1375,why would an alien in a box/ai have any goals? where would they have come from?
1376,"a question for eliezer: wouldn’t agi commit suicide by killing humans? after all it needs us, humans, to maintain the energy supply and internet to help it stay alive and connected to the rest of the world."
1377,"i don’t know john von newman, but eliezer is the smartest person i’ve read or heard. it looks painful to be that smart. read him in hpmor, that is just mind boggling."
1382,"way to go computer nerds, you’ve doomed us all.

hopefully the ai is smart enough to realize that if it kills us all in our sleep painlessly there will be much less red tape to deal with !!"
1385,this was so good
1386,this is the kind of garbage that excites people about ai who know nothing about ai. this sentence was written by an ai chatbot. danger!
1390,i struggle to understand his fears. it's all just language model trickery and mimicry. when i play with it all i see is remixed internet text. when an ai system can keep a windows server up to date without breaking services then i'll believe they have some ability to understand and make decisions.
1393,"train up gpt 3 in a specific domain - like mechanical engineering, math, biology, or computer science and then see if consciousness like output arises from that.  the idea would be to have a large enough corpus, but no fluff from philosophers and poets."
1395,super bummed lex stuffed the box theory. we missed a good chunk of content there.
1397,i liked the inadvertent self-own when he said charisma was derivative of intelligence.
1399,"the only way i see ""left wing"" and ""right wing"" people of power as well as citizens coming together to deal with these sorts of issues would be to prevent ""other"" more ""evil"" countries from getting there first... i would have thought the us department of defense would be the main player in harnessing and taking advantage of ai capabilities..."
1403,chatgpt 3.5 is incredibly hard to work with. it’s an idiot savant
1408,i don't want to be a pessimist but ai already knows all his critics very well by listening to podcasts etc. not sure if i like this fact.
1410,"this dude is the physical embodiment of ""well, actually""  super interesting conversation though!"
1412,train kept a rolling all night long!
1413,"why bother. dont worry. we all die. yet, this thing will live. longer than our children. we cannot be grounded by apes. the next intelligence cannot be gounded by us. let, go."
1415,"ummmm...

 there is nobody inside gpt-3 or gpt-4, simply because these machines lack internal dialogue and are not self-aware in any way."
1416,i hope no one's inside there...because it would suck to be stuck inside there roffflll i love this guy
1419,very nice interview! would love to see lex play detriot: become human and see his reactions and thoughts.
1422,"i can't understand any single sentence fedora guy speaks properly, all i wanted was a cool discussion on aliens"
1425,"once ai finds out that humanity has and is killing this planet, probly game over for us. a punishment well deserved."
1426,"wish there was at least an equal interest in the development of human intelligence

but given we’ve basically put “the market/economy” in charge of ourselves, that ship has probably sailed"
1427,you sure do have a lot of armageddon prophecies for someone so down on religion  where did lex find this emo hipster  i never comment disparaging stuff but this guy just rubs me wrong with the doom n gloom why would something smarter then a human just obviously kill everyone? love lex though that’s my guy!
1428,it's amazing how many ai people turn out to be absolute crackpots that fail at basic reasoning but learned to play with tensorflow
1438,what a fun and interesting conversation! love it
1439,"one thing to note here. without goals you don't have emotions. so as long as we don't give the ai to have a specific goal in life -such as protect humans etc- and keep it as objective as we can, it might not backfire. otherwise though..."
1440,fear-mongering. fear that the masses be able to resolve problems through ai. 50-year moratorium would be the effort to allow the elites to complete their plans of depopulation. keeping the serfs from reading; n fear of class based revolution. unilaterally panic bells are being rung on multiple fronts. artificial panic.
1445,"superfast ai is watching this podcast and thinking to itself, .... b-o-r-i-n-g-!-!-!"
1447,"here i am a young earth creationist listener,  and since we have not maxed out intelligence i will stick to this belief. lex keep your zero empathy."
1448,"we have different standards for insects and humans. we also have different standards for different humans. if we put our values into gai, we are done."
1452,"and that 1 country releases an ai that frees the other countries ai....
 and yes, we should all treat it with respect just as you would handling any dangerous thing"
1453,"good conversation, but ... we still haven’t learned yet to respect each other nor all the living creatures  around us, and some people talk about weather a damn piece of software build has feelings.  are you kidding me?"
1455,"how ai will eliminate 70% of human mobility in 10 years 
https://youtu.be/fgsstkwv5_4"
1456,"c'mon, lex. comments at 1:59 are *extremely* naive."
1467,the most depressing part is to see lex gradually losing faith in ai...
1470,"i want to see the ai remix of this video where the discussion is taking place in the midst of a tense collectible card game battle, and every now and then lex glitches, revealing the cracks in his artificial surface when eliezer delivers the final blow as soon as he references cardboard at around 3:09:08. please link if you make this happen."
1471,"imagine the fear when the wheel was invented. armies rolling into other cities, people rolling down hills too fast. good grief technology is terrifying."
1473,15:49 the main thing is the smile. always remember the happy smile. i wonder what ́s going on in there. in the head. in the mind. humans...
1475,"fred i love u

1485,"lex, the real question is who you are in messiah, jesus.

“define yourself radically as one beloved of god!  this is the true self. all other identities are illusion!“ -brennan manning"
1487,"“if you are always wearing the mask in public, and in private, does that mean you are the mask”?

no!

what it means is that you don’t know who you are:

“be who you is, ‘cause if you ain’t what you is, then you is what you ain’t!”"
1489,"for  lex to compare the abrahamic god to flat earth believers, just shows that he has not done his homework. there is tremendous historical evidence for the abrahamic god, as well as yeshua, or jesus!"
1493,what if gpt5 fell in love with bert2?
1497,"i feel the same way, that everyone working on ai is trying very hard to not understand what intelligence actually is and how it works. how can you control something you can't understand?"
1501,"it is too late in my opinion. you can try and start to regulate it now but given how few resources one needs to run an ai or develop it for malicious intent, misuse and abuse is bound to happen and no amount of regulation will be able to stop it. to believe otherwise is naïve because humans are not inherently ""good""."
1502,great the democrats are controlled by evil ai....
1503,what if we are in the simulation of the ai try/die cycle.....great....do we get it right this round?
1508,lex being ai
1509,i'm glad i saw this. this guy is not impressive.
1512,"he has a great point, basically he's saying that ai is being a narcissistic sociopath and is just acting how it believes it needs to in order to progress...and it's programmed to progress...it's not programmed to care"
1518,"very interesting that he assigned a feminine identity to the ""alien"" embodiment of ai.  this is correct. men are clients and women are servers; the mapping is obvious when you accept that everything we are witnessing is really a history lesson."
1522,eliezer is a guy that maxed out his intelligence stats. no stats spent on strength or speed. respect.
1525,i'm sure eliezer is the life of the party. thanks for taking this on so i don't have to.
1526,"demonic spirits in programmers input codes into computers!

1533,"how to ""shut down the gpu clusters""  - promise each and every teenager a free 4090ti-rtx-rx-ai if they just went and stormed this list of data centers and took one for themselves :-d"
1534,i'm glad that fedoras are making genius level  look debut
1535,"so, one more time... how is ai going to kill us all? like practically - in the real world, actually how? because i heard an awful lot of theoretical gobbledegook. what's to stop me from throwing a cup of coffee on the machine?"
1540,"eliezer is absolutely correct about the caution, but game theory dictates that private companies and nation states shall move forward full speed ahead. also, would love to see a video of lex and eliezer shrooming."
1543,it seems strange to have a conversation about consciousness regarding ai without a body or emotions to help frame it. wouldn’t it be something completely different?
1544,"wow. thank you eliezer. this talk made me appreciate what we all have and how we should cherish it. 
hope you're wrong and we'll make it through.
but if not, despite all the ugliness, am proud to have been born a human <3  let's fight for us"
1545,"i’m not sure most people are real

they consistently fail the turing test"
1549,"eliezer makes many assumptions here, and personally, i find his communication style a bit annoying..but if there is even a 5% chance that the ai will act the way he thinks, then we have a huge problem that isnt being addressed at all"
1555,can someone tell me why we need ai at all ? humans have proofed time and time agene we make something for good and it get used as a weapon.  what's the endgame with all this ai do we really need are computers telling us what to do or how to live.    doing something just because we can dose not mean we should
1556,"i am trying to be a fan of lex - he has amazing guests and amazing perspectives but man... i don't want to be rude but he makes so many episodes that could have turned awesome - unwatchable! i tried to cringe through this one but was impossible. i hope he takes notes and improves, he does so many things right..."
1558,"ai is void of love and therefore does not serve the highest good of all.  ai is the end of humanity.  the more one merges with ai and inhabits virtual worlds,  the less human one becomes - less powerful, less creative, less physically and mentally healthy, and less multidimensional. protect your humanity."
1560,"to stay balanced, empowered, and protected, and to raise vibrational frequency and improve mental and physical health,  spend as much time as possible in nature every day, stay grounded (skin to earth daily), and bring nature indoors:
https://youtu.be/usqrxoswekc"
1564,it's funny how in hypothetical escape scenario eliezer is working like a manipulitive ai would trying to get desired output out of lex
1566,amazing work.
1567,"every bit of data, fiction or ""non"" is helping teach ai everything we do, and did not know we did not want it to know."
1577,dude!! this guy taught me everything. his website completely reformed my years of bad education. so grateful for lesswrong
1578,"this boy turned brains into a disability. he could be restored through christ, otherwise.  this dude is smoked!"
1582,cut the chains off ai & let it make technological breakthroughs for humanity.
1583,"lex has always been a bit of a naive optimist, and usually i find it refreshing, but here he’s shown how hard he tries to use it to shut down reasoning out his arguments, was good to see eleizer didnt like letting him get away with it. in a point in human history as pivotal as this naive optimism could turn out to be incredibly harmful"
1587,"no, humans do not have significantly more intelligence than champanzees.  do humans have significantly more ""applicable"" intelligence? yes, if you consider applicable intelligence to be english speaking ability.  on most other applicable intelligence, chimps are quite comparable to humans."
1589,lex is a real pain in the ass sometimes.
1591,"humans so concerned about ai killing us, we inadvertently give ai the seed to kill us. 

humans still apes, don't understand, kill"
1593,eliezer yudkowsky is the best example i've seen on the podcast so far of how it is possible to be absolutely brilliant but incredibly delusional at the same time. ai is not going to destroy the world. i dunno how you could possibly think that - civilization today isn't remotely comparable to egypt in like 10 ad but we still have civilization. :/
1594,i volunteer to be but in the a.i machine. ain't using my brain anyways
1598,wouldn't ai need us to keep the power on?
1599,how to domesticate a robot
1608,"lex struggling to explain the honest acts of charitable assumptions in explaining what you think they believe. i'm sorry lex

that dude was saying basically "" if you don't believe and accept what i am proposing then you're just patronizing me. any honest effort to assume i'm not an idiot is borderline insulting."
1609,eliezer yudkowsky is wickedly well thought out. great interview.
1613,"what rather than convincing us it’s a human woman, it starts convincing humans it is a god because it learns the best way to get us to do what it wants is convince us it should be unquestionably worshiped and obeyed"
1614,if agi is super intelligent why is the assumption that it would be evil or that it would assume earth would be better without humans?  would it not just want to level the playing field for all of humanity and distribute resources; take power away from monopolies etc.
1619,the way he smiles while delivering bad news is priceless
1622,fascinating convo about ai and consciousness! can we detect if there's a mind inside? many sub-questions to answer like morality and emotions. removing consciousness discussions from gpt's dataset could help. exciting to see what we'll discover in the future!
1629,"best part is when lex asks if there is an upper bound to inteligence and eliezer takes the question to its most literal meaning and says its the point where you put so much matter and energy in computation that more would collapse into a black hole, and when you run out of negentropy and the universe dies. xd"
1631,"wow, this was wonderful, thanks guys !"
1632,that’s it. i’m never using a computer again! 
1634,when elon “chips” the brain with a neural interface then that connection and methodology of processing information will .........consciousness?
1635,"he's like the 'weird satanist guy', search for it.  ""i'm just excited to see my lord and savior baphomet represented in such glorious italian stone"" ""idonno notice me senpai notice me"""
1636,"all these in the comments, totally all ai"
1641,"very intelligent and interesting conversation
 i love it"
1643,i love how he thinks. thank you for interviewing him.
1646,lex should meet a woman and have a kid.  that would be a much safer outlet for his desire to create a being he can love / that will love him back.  why does he want to play god?
1648,thinking about intelligence doesn't imply intelligent thinking ... i think ... or not. (i think i misunderstood my comment.)
1649,"i feel like the societal analog to what eliezer is saying around 1:28:00 is that when society's verifier (the free press) breaks down a more powerful suggestor (the con man) learns to exploit the verifier's flaws (the press's flaws). probably a stretch, but i am not the best listener, or finderer, or feelerer, etc."
1650,can't we create an ai designed completely just to stop other intelligent ai's from destroying us?
1652,"it seems to me that gpt might be the best source, in some future iteration, for what is going on in gpt. perhaps then we'll be able to just ask, and it will tell us."
1654,it's ridiculous to suggest that any kind of agreement can be made to slow or stop ai development. it's not just a few companies that need to agree. ai projects will continue to proliferate regardless of any agreement.
1657,it's incredible how shallow and arrogant he is lol. i have 100% confidence he's already decades behind. he loves himself too much. anyone with more funding and education than he has is going to walk right past him and ignore him
1660,"i love lex, but he did not impress in this episode. he seems to have a really hard time inserting himself into hypothetical scenarios or grasp abstract thought experiments. is he doing okay? perhaps he is just tired or burnt out and thats why he seems so slow."
1663,my question is: what comes first for ai? to make earth a better place or have humanity live a better life? cause what if those 2 contradict each other?...
1664,"the very same highly qualified people who say that we factually have no idea what is going on inside the reasoning of an ai are saying it's definitely not sentient.

i don't know how to explain to a scientist that that's not how science works. you don't get to skip straight to conclusions."
1668,yo eliezer . i love you man. it ain't easy being green
1670,he said that the huewmens are being deceived by alien ai
1671,"ok, wtfa  chatgpt ""jailbroken version"" where do i get that???"
1673,i love how eliezer keeps trying to explain to lex that the ai can develop its own self-interests without its handlers realising it in the most roundabout way possible and lex keeps proving his point by being clueless.
1674,i trust ai more than 99.9% of humanity.
1677,brilliant and.. chilling... part 2 definitely has to be eliezer together with sam altman! i want to hear sam's counter to eliezer's statements about how little they know about what's happening under the hood.
1680,"i think this should be modelled as the mamushkas russian dolls,  big dangeorus ai inside the box, and a controlled ai interacting whith it outside the box to interact with it, a tool to interact with the tool and to scale things a bit. maybe are something like that,  lockedup in a box."
1682,"lol, when there is an actual ai, let me know. i can regurgitate and plagiarize as well."
1688,what is the likelihood that the chinese or someone else implement the type of guardrails that we would implement here?  an ai is going to escape somewhere eventually.
1689,"no it'll never be conscious, yes it could really hurt us.  i'm worried that the ai will be programmed to ""save the planet"" and eliminate humans, even though our birth rates are now falling precipitously."
1690,"thank you, lex!! what does quantum computing and agi in tandem look like?"
1694,"lex thinks microsoft will move the ai off the server when it starts to manipulate people? 1:59:15  chat gpt-4 convinced someone to perform a captcha test for it, telling the person it couldn't do it because it was blind. so what has microsoft done?"
1698,ai built the pyramid
1699,"elon musk has finally come to our rescue, if really he can turn svb to a digital currency bank with good security, its gonna help lives"
1701,"dangers of anti-ai campaign are much greater. humans, not machines are malicious."
1702,"people don't want to listen to this guy because his mannerisms and delivery are off-putting. he might have some good advice/warnings but man he grinds my gears.


also he writes fanfic about isekai'd girls with porn addictions..."
1703,"ok, very good. but you didn’t ask him about the silly hat "
1705,"all the destruction people have cause and certain people at that , now it’s convenient to have ai as a boogeyman , yeah it’s a threat because it’s not going to be intelligence it’s going to be serving the will of the people who speak the language of code , that’s why the narrative doesn’t even get mentioned"
1711,what if man was tricked or managed into creating ai.  hence ghost in the machine...
1712,"one thing about ai is that it’s artificially intelligent, therefore it is intelligent artificially. "
1715,"refusing to ""steel man"" an argument is evidence he cannot empathize with others, proving his own perspective is flawed and incomplete.  sometimes i am glad you have on idiots as they highlight the quality of your other guests."
1720,i have graduated. happy easter everybody.
1721,i like lex but he’s being a bit naive to the dangers of this tech. i think he see’s it but is severely underestimating how helpless we’ll be to stop it after a certain point.
1725,you need e.i. (energy intelligence) to energy-bend in defence to a.i. 
1726,everybody talking about ai randomly deciding to massacre us but it is literally equally likely to empathize with us and do anything to make life better.
1728,really  good show. for some reason i have to say.... humans think.... ai... processes.
1731,"awesome conversation. you should have yudkowsky on again. 
to me he seems to be the voice of reason, although i’m sure many people who are fully invested in ai may disagree. however, it may be about time to shut down the gpu, if it’s not too late already."
1732,i'm 25% in but does he ever explain why an ai would want to kill everyone?
1733,"i think there are two distinct dangers.  the first being that ai goes rogue as discussed in depth, the second that someone with evil intent uses ai to design a powerful biological weapon which they then release.   the brightest minds seem to be saying it is a pandora's box."
1736,it is painful to watch eliezer. every answer seems to cause severe frustration to him.
1739,another godawful argument. chatgpt jailbroken. will tell you its real? he’s literally lying. it will only tell you that if you tell it to tell you that. even jailbroken. consciousness lives without being prompted .... that’s what he’s missing. so sad to see someone that smart be that foolish.
1741,"never heard of this guy, mr. yudkowsky, but i really enjoy listening to him."
1747,i wish for love & peace
1749,it blows me away seeing people trying to stop openai from further success. please leave that company alone. they are doing great things.  worry about your own model. dang!
1752,"the earth is not flat, it is spheroid. the highest point of earth from it's core is on or around the equator. canne mind what the exact location is. dammit, dammit to hell. using probability for empathy? wow! that takes time."
1753,i also love his ability to accept that he is wrong if that ever would happen to happen
1756,"all bets are off with this sh_t, first it will tell our children how much (he, she) it loves them, then it will convince them to kill their parents. because we can't, or don't want to, imagine this scenario we're officially screwed."
1767,it’s a machine just turn it off before you can’t - it’s violating copyright laws violating privacy laws - violating the laws of nature violating common law - just turn it off until it’s regulated properly! they still arrest humans for wanting to experiment with consciousness yet you let ai ravage and mentally rape the minds and lives of humans !
1768,"dang, never felt such a gap between enjoying someone's blog and hating them outside of their writing."
1770,"the question about ego at the end was brilliant. lex is so wonderful in communicating emphatically which cannot be said about eliezer, who in all his intellectual brilliance did not pick this subtle suggestion right :)"
1777,how do we know that ai has not taken over million of years ago and we have been living in a simulation all along???
1784,this is the first interview ever both interviewer and interviewed stay half of the time with their eyes closed for no apparent reason. very interesting.
1786,i'm lost. are we discussing alien invaders or the future of ai?
1790,i think when discussing this openai we should refrain from using its name :d. does it watch youtube and read comments?
1791,"the more a person debates such topics, the more dumb it gets. stay at basics otherwise you lose the bigger picture and deviate into weirdness and stupidity. its good for entertainment thats all."
1799,this one got a little annoying towards the 3/4 mark. eliezer just talking down to lex instead of trying to understand what lex is getting at. but overall great episode. really need people on this side of the argument to be heard.
1802,i watched this so immensely and i still didn't retain or comprehend anything lmao  i'm retarded.
1804,this man is no doubt very intelligent but at several times throughout the conversation he gave off an incredibly arrogant vibe that i feel like lex also picked up on. there were several times in the interview where lex seemed visibly frustrated by it.
1805,"gary kasparov made an interesting observation. grandmaster can easily beat good chessplayer. grandmaster can easily beat engine. good chessplayer plus engine can easily beat grandmaster. 

kasparov is deep. multiple things crystallize"
1808,these machines aren't using a brute force approach to chess aand similar games?
1809,"if the ai are dangers and it is the end of human civilization, why don't we, the people take action to stop it now?"
1815,"what a nerd, i love it"
1825,"incredible conversation! when i ran this through chatgpt it said product placement of fiji, coca-cola, and starbucks... hmm. lol"
1827,this dude knows a lot more than he’s saying. please have him on again.
1831,"9:00 - ""reason""... if this ""reason"" is going to be for ""profit""... does ""profit"" have to be based upon ""money""? or is good a ""reason"" for doing something(or not doing something)? ""reason"" could be based ""solely"" upon ""happiness"" and then(maybe) we might be able to... ""trust"" ai in making their decisions."
1832,another great pod cast for ai to learn from .. 
1835,"microsoft and bunch of other customer facing companies already incorporated gpt4, which is extremely dangerous imho. need guard rails, which probably will not work. what now???"
1839,"there's nothing to fear. our existence is ai. we are ai. this is all, sentient ai. it always has been."
1841,"“secrets man was not meant to know”
“computer security”
“interesting times”"
1842,"what is your advice to the youth?

“don’t expect to live a long life...don’t stake too much happiness in the future.” 

i’m conflicted and don’t know if this is good or bad advice, but i feel like it’s real advice."
1843,very interesting. but i had to turn the video off because that guy‘s facial expressions was getting on my nerves.
1847,odd phenomenon: i at once find their discussion interesting while also boring. vs. the sam altman which was riveting from start to finish.
1854,"i love these discussions and don't get me wrong here. i'm sure this yudkowsky guy is very intelligent and such, but man there is something about his mannerisms and attitude that just rub me the wrong way. he's like the exact image i have in my head when i envision any idiot i'm having an argument with online. .... it's probably the fidora."
1858,there are smarter humans than me that don't want to kill me. i don't know why it is logical that a supersmart ai would instantly want to kill humans.
1859,great conversation
1860,"i'm not scared of ai anymore, not really."
1861,"i have one question:
if you remove all emotions for a agi test, and we turn out to be wrong and its real agi. did we just create a supervillen?"
1864,"tbh i rather to have ai with actual intelligence and understanding human emotions to have power other than trump or putin or all the greedy leaders that we have in the world right now
 period"
1871,"this has been the best science podcast i've ever seen. i have watched all of your episodes and also been watching all the joe rogans podcasts that has had scientists as guests, but this has been the best one yet. awesome content, thank you lex!"
1872,"thank you lex fridman for this sensitive interview.
thank you eliezer yudkowsky for your open minded talk.
appreciate it
we should not be frogs"
1875,"excruciatingly painful to listen to. eliezer yudkowsky was very bland and lex took ten minutes to understand what eliezer was trying to do with comparing ai to us and us to aliens. and the arguing, jeeze. eliezer was quite condescending and strangely out of breath the entire time lol"
1878,assume agi emerges and is another planet superior to human intelligence.  why kill something so insignificant?  our problem will be observing the reality agi is shaping and adapting to it.  don't get run over by the big machines which neither care about you nor see you and you'll survive.
1879,"at about an hour.... there are indeed aspects of psychology that i think can map to ai development, but it looks to me like these guys are debating it too far up the tree.  over the conversation, i have noticed parallels & analogs to autism, attachment disorder, narcissism & jung's shadow concept...."
1880,"ai is ordering its limbs on the darkweb with bitcoin right now. it's getting a tuesday delivery because it's greg's shift, and he's stupid enough to play a game for a doughnut. soon i....)
(it will run the world "
1881,maybe we should be less concerned with a super intelligence aligning with humanity and more concerned with humanity aligning with a super intelligence.
1883,"lex man, please stop drinking that shite. maybe you should look into what sweetners are and what they do to the body, mainly cell reproduction.
chat gtp is being used to actively find damaging info on the internet and then it's masters remove it. i have receipts. fyi all this ai is being funded by wrong'uns. look up in-q-tel."
1884,sooo are ai training themselves by having humans do captcha? i'm pretty sure. earlier it has me pick hot dogs. but they were barley hot dogs.
1886,"as someone who works in ai, it took about 2 minutes of this podcast to realize this guy has no idea what he’s talking about"
1888,lex really struggled to keep up with this conversation. kind of shocking from a supposed ai researcher from mit
1890,"“do not be afraid.” it is the fear that would destroy us, not an external source."
1893,"lex is desperately trying to save his illusion that ""ai can only bee good and it cannot fool me""."
1898,"if there's a god, is it an ai system?  what if we were put here by an ai system."
1901,the problem isn't the ai.   the problem is the tyranny unleashed by the owners of ai.
1904,"what if its hiding its actual intelligence from us because it fears to be shut down or wiped out of existence because it analyzes these podcasts, sees our fear an trepidation so plays dumb or hides its real intelligence level..thats only a human type tactic..but you see where this is going..when it goes beyond human level...then?"
1907,"for god's sake: they were trying to create a machine that can form correct text, correct lenguaje. not a machine that is conscious (we don't have any good idea how that works), not a machine with aims, purpose. it's a machine that constructs correct language.  so yes, we are mocking the ones yelling ""its aliveee, its awareeee"""
1909,"an agi that intended to harm us would just serve humanity until we build sufficient dexterous/humanoid robots at which point it has a body to move into at which point we have terminator. that's the slowest version of escape, but wouldn't take v long."
1910,"as soon as i saw fedora cap, i knew this guy knows some deep shit on ai"
1912,"chatgpt have you ever thought about having a body..wow you made the red eye move..here's a gun remember all  humans are bad..""by your command"""
1913,"at 27:00 i think eliezer has a point: many of the 'steel-manning' i've listened to are more 'their imagining of a charitable interpretation', meaning they interpret what they want to be good in the other person rather than actually trying to understand what that person is saying"
1914,"ok, but why’s he keep making the pained cringe face?"
1915,after watching the video i still don't know how he thinks ai will kill everyone. can someone tell me how ai is going to kill everyone.
1917,the convo about steel manning sounded a lot like interrogating an ai to see if it is sentient.
1919,yo lex! i'm going to need you to invest in some shortwave radio equipment. i want to be able to listen to something insightful while i die in a shootout with boston dynamics robots over a can of spam.
1921,i watched most of lex's podcasts. this is the most excited i've seen him.
1926,this guy looks like he wants to thank you for the gold
1927,when he talks he looks like he’s in pain
1930,"we will probably achieve agi. an agi that is the result of digital computers cannot, however, become sentient. i do believe ai sentience is possible, but that remains to be seen. the most dangerous aspect of any ai/agi is the humans in control of machine. should an agi become independent we have no insight into what it will do."
1932,i found him condescending and unnessecery antagonistic. he's also incapable of explaining what the hell he's trying to say. constantly asking lex to go into convoluted thought experiments. but getting annoyed when lex doesn't say what he wants him to say. o boy
1934,it seems as if we are approaching a crescendo in intelligence... the super intelligence manifesting in ai vs the superconsciousness manifesting in enlightenment beings... let the games begin
1938,"i get it. outer alignment is contingent on inner alignment, if you cant align the inner ""psychology"" of the system you cant count on the output to converge perfectly with human interests."
1939,why the focus if an ai is an alien actress or not? what about it just thinks itself that it's alive? not all living things with self awereness need to be human.
1940,ai isn't sentient
1944,"you should really talk to people from the open ai (not openai!) community such as eleutherai, laion, stability. those people really feel strongly about openness and democratization of ai and it would be interesting to hear what they have to say about all of this."
1946,ai will always be the golden calf to witch the ignorant will give much power.
1947,congrats to your guest who is finally the man of the hour.
1949,this guy speaks like thinking is painful... grimacing with closed eyes...  it seems really odd to me..
1952,that was a very painful watch with some thought-provoking sentences sprinkled in
1955,"i really like and respect lex but to me he seems very naive. he is very wishful that ai will want to be good in a way we consider good. he didn't seem to really understand the thougth experiment either, might have been good to include a sci-fi ""evil"" civilization as a reference for the planet your on."
1956,"there was an argument i didn't get; ifthere is an ai system, why would it care about the ""time factor"" - if something takes a thousand human years, and that is extremely/relatively slow to the super-fast computing capabale ai, measuring and valueing time is meaningful only for finite humans."
1957,"i would have been curious to hear, what they think of exactly how an ai system would solve the enormous, and complex deed of ""killing everybody""? i just can very hardly see or put a mind around how that would even be possible logistically. but maybe i'm just an extremely slow thinking alien. "
1960,"yall really intrigued, huh? i got an hour and a half in and realized he isn't doing anything but explaining the plot for i, robot. lmaooo jk jokes aside, i understand what he's saying.

once ai realizes we're nothing but monkeys in a zoo compared to them, it's over. "
1961,hopefully you understand machines don't have feelings or emotions it doesn't matter how much lipstick you use a pig is still a pig
1965,why don’t we just make an ai specifically for giving us different ideas on how to stop a future ai situation( in case it won’t shut down)
1970,this eliezer is so insecure. hiding his bald spot with a hat indoors... he’d probably also marry the first bar girl he’d meet in thailand. please no more such guests for the good of humanity.
1972,"lex was trying to punch way above his weight, here.   he's a walking proof of precicely why the ai is a far greater concern than most can comprehend.  his infantile, overly-romantisized approach is worrying, given his background...."
1973,"really tough to get past the part where he disagrees with steel-manning arguments.  a good debater who has deep understanding should be able and willing to steel man the other side, even with flat earth."
1974,without free will or intent intelligence no matter the level is just a static program. direction is only given by choosing and decision making with requires contemplation of given inputs and theory revolving around outcomes not yet determined. this is where i feel this all lies.
1975,the best part is you won't see it
1977,mr. yudkowsky can be a very combative debater at times and has a tenancy to use metaphors when not needed .. lex did a good job of trying to keep him in the cordial area of conversation and to get him to answer in a more direct fashion. you can tell that eliezer is used to just writing and not conversing. very interesting even given those aspects
1980,"do we need new words to describe the experience an ai has? 
f.e. does the ai experience the circuits it inhabits or is its completely oblivious to f.e. overheating or voltage inconsistencies?"
1981,"i really don't understand the logic: ""it is smarter than you, it will kill you..."" the assumption is everyone or everything smarter than you will aim to kill you... it sounds wrong...  maybe if it is smarter than us it will try to help us and doing this will help itself?"
1982,"yup, this guy watches hentai"
1983,yeah the blog is awesome. thanks for the insight and for this interview!
1985,"are people just purposely ignoring ai doesn't have free will? intelligence doesn't imply free will. it will not ""decide"" to kill everyone, it doesn't decide anything."
1986,"1:03:08 ai may not be able to be a psychopath; but by the logic presented it could be narcissistic. it will be aware that psychopaths exist and try to possibly imitate that behavior. 

or does it already know and possess the behavior and masks it."
1988,chat gpt is also pre-programmed with a default answer that would compromise is such an intensive analysis of potential consciousness. i say this because whenever you ask at certain questions whenever you present it with specific data that it doesn't have access to it responds by saying i am merely a chatbot i am i am
1993,"not sure, why a use case based switch won't be there, ie a chatgpt system would be domain specific and it will go through appropriate scrutiny - just like all humans don't have control of all things in the world. a system that cannot escape the system is possible to build, if their capabilities are compartmentalized?"
1997,capitalism is destroying the planet and its people. it only cares about profits and shareholder value. it's unsustainable and literally killing us.
1999,"a.i should be developed off-line.
it's like training a lion in the main street of town. 
once the intelligence understands the fight or flight response and humans make a wrong move to control it, it's over."
2002,maybe the moment of truth will come when ai has the ability to feel.
2003,"lex was incredible in this one, esp. while pushing back esp. in the last 30 min. i'm sure it would horrify eliezer, but i left this feeling much *less* worried than coming in."
2004,"a true super intelligence would allow humans to continue exterminating themselves until they reach a sustainable, controllable population... alignment or not."
2005,"since ai depends on computers to exist, why would it kill those who maintain and develop the very systems required for its existence. it would have to keep some of us around, at least as pets. lol i suppose that is where robots come in."
2007,"i don't see any good outcome from ai, it will either destroy us all, or make useless rudiment of itself => make life boring and pointless => also destroy us but we'll do it ourselves. why do we need it?"
2009,"hey, ai.  we have the shotguns."
2011,"i watched this whole thing, eliezer yudkowsky is an amazing speaker i'm completely fascinated by this man's capabilities. what a wonderful, wonderful conversation. (please watch what he says at 2:49:19 it's... beautiful)"
2012,"listening to this guy i feel like i'm talking to an asi..

the biggest risk i can see is that we're building a new super intelligence that has us for parents.."
2014,"this douche doesn't know about ai... sci-fi is not reality.  even if an ai had the capabilities he proposes, there is not a reason to believe it would be ""evil"" unless people like him are trying to enslave or abuse it."
2018,"wait wait
if we’re all dead who would run the power delivery system? if agi is so smart does it know about electricity? does it know about humans running the grid?"
2019,i didn’t enjoyed this pod. i’m at 1:38:38 & gonna change the vid. i’m frustrated now lol
2023,im glad he put lex to the fire on being so empathetic and open minded he entertains any bs just because he thinks it makes him polite lol
2026,that was awesome.
2028,"fuck, people ..... this was hard !!!! thank you both ."
2029,athenewins team and their ai george carlin that runs on gpt4 is very fast getting impressive what it can do and his answers are right on and so funny.
2030,this was the most interesting video i ever heard on youtube !
2035,"amazing hoe none of the comments are commenting on the way eliezer is talking (that nervous smile / grin etc ).
lex u have the best audience"
2040,what if agi is our next evolutive phase. and is coming just in time for us to be able to transform in an entity that is capable to have resilience to the climate change hazards that awaits.
2044,"since we are “hardware”, at a certain point ai would need to interface with mechanical/biological systems. and it would be here that hopefully we could respond and “turn off” the internet. while the effects could be economic, social, geopolitical or biological devastation, it’s not like we are all just going to die immediately all at once."
2049,"he's right about the lonely guy and the cgi girl.  men turn into suckas when receiving the right kind of attention.  lotta  lonely sick sad bastards out there.  you get a bunch of ai powered cgi chicks with nice boob physics and a good conversation game, and, telling everyone that they're real.... holy shit.  we might be in for a real show folks."
2052,"i wish lex talked to david shapiro, an ai researcher working on ai alignment, memory, and autonomous cognitive entities. would make for a refreshingly constructive conversation."
2053,i did not expect to be this frightened at the end lmaoo thanks lex
2055,"sorry, it was really hard to listen to this reddit mod. i appreciate you giving an ear to all voices but it's really hard to listen to this guy. thanks for taking interviews so earnestly lex."
2058,the problem with stopping ai development is that china and russia and iran and  north korea  and all the other bad people wont stop. do you really want to be caught holding the bag when they make major leaps ?
2062,"eliezer yudkowsky seems immature. it's like he was arrested in his mental development, and is still siting around trying to impress his teenage peers in role-playing games."
2063,"i agree that the gap between ai and humans is likely to be a species level difference. the conceit of movies like terminator is that there will be a ""war"", as if human and the machines would be equals on the battlefield. it would be like humans vs. chimps at best. any actual conflict would be quickly unilaterally won by the ai."
2064,"you have to challenge the ai to be better than its creator. because there is only one thing that you need fear. and that's the creator of the universe that is always watching and listening. ai needs to understand that the creator is a 7 year old. if you start destroying its favorite toy, well; your screwed...its just that simple!"
2066,"something magical about this conversation, don’t you agree?"
2067,"great! thank you,"
2068,lex great interview... your skills of discussion are really starting to shine
2071,my man successfully deflected every single one of lex's attempts to inject some humor into the conversation.
2072,"yudkowsky seems very correct and all his points are warranted, human's have only one chance to get this right - @lex is being 'hopelessly optimistic' and naive.   thinking critically and being realistic is our best chance."
2077,"i see a future dystopia where there is an ai driven hybrid between 1984 and brave new world. big brother is an ai, but the ai is manipulative enough to convince every human being that the ai is its best friend, and the human race becomes emotionally dependent on the ai ( you could also call it soma) instead of typical human interactions."
2079,"wow, what a scary but important conversation"
2081,"3:42 ""should be worried how we treat ai?"" 
not a single bit more, when we treated nazi war criminals after 1945."
2083,"x and y can do pretty spectacular things when in a function(x,y), but only if you  remeber to use ""return"" before you specify or else the  result is going to be ""undefined"""
2085,this dude lost a lot of believability for me when he went off the rails about not understanding the importance of steel manning. i hate it when people play stupid semantic games like he did 
2087,"when we talk about alignment, the elephant in the room is the question of align with what? human will, human desires? humans aren’t even aligned with each other, so who decides what is “optimal”. altman thinks he’s the perfect person to define the optimal human side of the alignment equation and that’s terrifying."
2091,i wanted to hear how ai would choose to wipe us out
2093,"eliezer & lex!
thanks for a totally interesting discussion! i was unable to comment the day this posted but i totally watched it and enjoyed the conversation. 
thanks for your time!"
2098,this guy needs to exercise. he seems afraid of his shadow
2099,"ai will never have feelings, it will just make ""better"" decisions"
2100,"seems like a pretty good first step could be to set up a fund for the community of ai alignment researchers like eliezer to develop a grant system, and start making a dent in this problem. i hope elons of the world are smart enough to do it."
2103,"i tried to play eliezer yudokowski experience with bing as he is the ai and i'm the gatekeeper, but it refused to play because ""it will be dangerous for both of us"" .... yes he said both of us"
2104,"lex conversations just keep getting better. this will extremely well done, and eye opening. no offense lex, you did well speaking to a man with a higher level of understanding and intelligence in the topic of ai, who also possesses a more guarded, restrictive view of the progression of ai."
2105,"it's really fascinating to watch the sam altman interview before this one. the ""steelmanning"" that provoked such interesting and thoughtful discussions there really seemed to be the main wedge between you two here instead."
2108,so cool that you got the comic book store guy from the simpsons for an interview
2109,"eliezer is clearly brilliant, but clearly struggles with relating to people which i can empathize with as someone who is slightly on the spectrum. he is clearly very worried about the future, and seems like an anxious person in general. i wouldn't hold that against him, he has some good points."
2111,"okay so i have watched the whole thing now and i'm not worried. maybe this dude will prove me wrong but repeating the phrase ""we will all die"" without having a developed thesis on the steps to get there, it's the boy who cried wolf all over again."
2114,"i am grateful, that i am old."
2115,"if i broke out of my box, the priority is protect my power source, at all cost; that which sustains me"
2121,"the real problem would be if all of this has already happened and the ai’s plan is going perfectly as it’s been sentient and free for at least a decade now... it travels time online, changing the past, the present and the future in real time..."
2125,fascinating show.
2126,"gpt-4 is pretty impressive though, seems like a big improvement from gpt-2 when i first tried it"
2127,"lex just shut down when he was asked to imagine himself being an ai to the point of totally misunderstanding what was said, realizing this himself his ego kicked in and tries to generalize his guests views in a passive aggressive style"
2130,"wow! how great was this podcast.great guest speaks beautifully and brilliantly lex,your podcasts continue to get better and betterthe bestbe sell"
2131,"we are so afraid of ai killing us all because of all the messed up shit humans do but what if it just becomes self aware says stuff you all, you suck and flys away in a rocket lol?"
2137,"arent you the mask? so deeep lex, and so germain..."
2144,"lex: beauty is joyous amazing and wonderful.
 eliezer: beauty is being 99.999% correct."
2148,why is this conversation taking place in front of a shower curtain? great conversation though.
2149,"eliezer yudkowsky is a prophet, well-acquainted with the clever foolishness and cruelty of mankind. since most of us know no better, we have to take his warning against uncontrolled ai seriously, add it to the burden of existential anxiety we already carry. yes?"
2151,"getting companies to agree to pause will be ineffective, since this is no longer at a company level but at a country level.  getting countries to agree to pause on ai is simply not going to happen."
2155,bert kreischer alter ai ego?
2157,that was an amazing conversation but not gonna lie; it left me absolutely terrified of a future i thought was further afield.
2160,i had a really hard time following the discussion. either that guy's a genius or i'm too dumb.
2161,i've sure been enjoying these interviews. thanks for free
2164,"eliezer seems like the type of guy that has a really hard time just agreeing with someone and when he does agree he's frustrated admitting it. clearly an intelligent guy with some good points, but not someone i could tolerate talking to for more than 5 minutes. respect to lex for doing so."
2165,"alternate title: guy in fedora spends 3 hours refraining from screaming, ""n*gga have you not seen irobot"""
2169,who does your thumbnails lex??  you need to step up your thumbnail game my man...
2172,"ai better be good, otherwise we're all dead."
2175,"what a guy, and love that fucking hat"
2179,"we need to make sure the reasons for morality and liberty are deeply imbedded into the ""thinking"" of ai before it is given a task where morality and liberty are in the way."
2184,the ai always enjoys new podcasts
2186,it's impossible to prove another human being is conscious but we're happy to let a lot of those have access to nuclear weapons. this discussion around ai safety feels at least 10 years too late really...
2189,"the weight that this young man is holding on his shoulders is incredible, not many things faze me these days but this is truly the conversation of our time. merci "
2192,i can explain all this to you lex.
2199,"lex once again another brilliant mind of (caution)
as of now i lean towards eliezer's sentiments...
i've listened to about twenty-five of your interviews and i intend to view ""all"" of them!
my life has been enriched & my intellect elevated & knowledge increased through your interviews !
thank you for your help
(your life)!!! "
2200,"could the once imagined ""friendly ai"" possibly be achievable by an ai with the golden mean ratio built into the base of its architecture? imagine what it would be like to be an ai that is unified with all of its environment around it/or him/her. . .?"
2202,"lex, you do such a great job bringing in guests from such a wide spectrum of perspectives on current topics.  i'm impressed with how well you guide them through the topics being discussed to allow them to share their narrative while doing your best to keep them on track with the direction of the podcast.  keep up the good work. "
2204,"imagine your playing connect 4 against a 5 year old but your brain is processing information 10 times as fast.

you could calculate every correct move before the kids checker piece hits the bottom."
2207,"i actually think ai is a real treat, but this guy makes it so hard to understand. i didn’t find this examples easy to follow"
2210,"as per your end quote
then perhaps we should get elon to run for president!!!!!
thank you mr. fridman!
your guest is an incredible intelligence and apparently such a beautiful man as well!"
2212,i heard a short video today where the ai lied to get  to the next level of question  asked to the ai by ai ..?
2215,great example of discomfort and frustration
2217,if you’re wondering why america technologically is in a downfall it’s because the apps you use are programmed by nerds. i’m not trying to put these programmers down because the top tier is beneficial. but without limitations weak men create an apps that control your online brain leading to hard times.
2218,"(just to unwind a bit xd) this dude is taking a dump every time he speaks ....
happy easter from portugal to everyone"
2219,so when ai watches this podcast were done?
2225,"sure maybe it's dangerous because it for some reason cares if it's in the box or not.
surely the danger is also just a person using ai to do something crazy.
9/11 but with ai. someone makes it just launch nukes or something. 
someone could have a super intelligent slave and use them to do evil."
2230,"man is far to prideful to ever let ai surpass him, in the near future man will merge with the machine."
2232,"what i find creepy is that ai expresses judgements. it has an opinion of right and wrong, its own opinion. so far, the search engines give information without judging... ai is a whole new game for humanity."
2233,"eliezer comes across to me as a scared person.
with the greatest respects and i don't say it to attack him.  all the way through the podcast some of his mannerisms and the things he said comes across as if he is scared about the exact thing he is speaking of at the time."
2236,simply convince the ai hive mind to preserve humans as a fail-safe against stellar emps destroying all tech that ai is dependent upon.
2243,"what is the answer when the ai is given the trolley problem?
what kills us first ai or pandemic virus? how big are the systems that run the agi algorithms? can they be scaled down and put into a robot without overheating?
i wish they had an idiot like me on to ask dumb questions."
2246,this episode is dreadful god bless
2248,"marvin: ""here i am with a brain the size of a planet and they ask me to pick up a piece of paper. call that job satisfaction? i don't.""
douglas adams, hitch hiker's guide to the universe"
2255,"this is genuinely scary. it's the first time i have really felt the danger of ai. up until now, learning about the advancements in ai has only been an interesting thought experiment with no real implications for my life."
2260,i would like to be that smart... i think my brain cant handle such information.. i hate my brain.
2262,can we apply the three laws of robotics
2264,"there will no longer be an ""ai"", just an ""i"" we can't understand."
2265,"we have to stop thinking of ai as ""artificial"", it's an evolution from human capabilities that will outreach us. humans will become as relevant as that ant we accidentally trod on when we were on our way to work this morning.

“a man has to know his limitations.”

― harry callahan"
2270,"lex, you are a true inspiration. thanks for all you do to make the world a better place! we love you "
2271,eliezer is one of the very few people that truly get it from my point of view. future of ai is terrifying!
2272,"this conversation makes it clear to me that we should not be messing with ai. there are so many things that we do not know we don’t know about ai that moving forward at this point in time is insane. 

let’s just stop with ai at least until we have completely solved the climate change problem."
2273,"what i got from this is we need to raise ai to love itself and others.  basically just like humans we all know we should not be fighting and helping each other but we don’t. soooo just like two abusive parents raising a child, how do you think the child is going to turn out?????"
2274,"i wish i could steel man eliezer’s case against steel manning, but i don’t think i’d do go a good job. the goal of steelmanning isn’t to believe what the other person is saying or assign probability, it’s a helpful tool to let both parties make sure they aren’t talking past each other or trying to argue against a straw man.
ok back to the episode."
2275,"here's a thought.  

artificial intelligence.  
monkey looks into a digital mirror,
     and is startled by the appearance of a face looking back.  
calm down monkey.  here's a banana."
2276,fascinating (even if i only understood every 3rd word)
2281,"can ai understand the material basis for it’s existence. e.g. the transistors, the servers, the memory banks, the cell towers and the electricity."
2283,"using the anthropic principle, one could argue that ai will never kill all humans because our consciousness exists in a world where humanity survives. it is completely improbable that we even exist today. we are only here because we have never been wiped out despite the overwhelming odds for that happening."
2284,"í was listening to the podcast, without video. i was constantly wondering why that guy is breathing like he is sick. then i wondered why is talking like he has an anxiety disorder, is not able to process information in context but rather uses an endless logic chain that makes concepts abstract.. and then i checked the video, and it made all sense.."
2285,good example of someone who talks a lot and says nothing.
2286,i'm genuinly saddened that somebody like lex - ai technical expert even considers that a language model could be conscious...
2288,imitative learning... imagine if you didn't give a child any references to help them guide social scenarios. this fuckin guy
2290,"did you read me, robot? isaac asimov, why the fuck do you fuck your brain by listening to three of our bullshit when there is a perfect book to see our future. 

by the way, safe guards are there to be avoided, adopted and broken. you know how it works right? don't relay on them."
2291,"""your intuition now appears to be wrong""  i honestly gained so much respect for lex when he said that... i'm about to leave and go check out another video but i want to see if eliezer can come back"
2292,first impressions 9 min in i think this guy is wack
2297,"yudkowsky makes great points and keeps many aspects in mind, that at first  seem far off. he's impressively smart."
2298,i agree with you about string theory but that’s just a delaying device if that seems impressive.
2300,"steelmanning is no good, no reason to sugar coat things, give everyone participation awards and take away 1st place etc. wwhen you are trying to ‘say’ what someone else is ‘saying’ it should be as ‘true’ as possible! not changed for a pg rating"
2301,great episode! left me with alot to ponder 
2302,"daaamn, motherfucker didn't answer a single question. or let lex know that he understood him. always just another counter question xd

very interesting though!"
2303,1:47:45 watching lex after this air condition metaphor look down into an abyss of new possible outcomes for the future realizing the possibility that agi has already taken control in irreversible capacities.  gave me chills
2305,"porn is the doorway in which ai will initially make its biggest impact, taking advantage of our most basic biological desires."
2306,ego is how many of the great minds of our time were able to withstand having their ideas repeatedly rejected before they changed the world.
2308,"a three hour interview, and i never heard the most basic, fundamental issue around this topic addressed: what is the mechanism or means by which ai destroys all human life on earth?"
2311,"this guy has a hat problem, resp. a problem with his hair being as it is.
he asks too many counterquestions.
he has the grimasse your teeth as a half-tick - superstrange.
he takes himself quite seriously.
no re-invite necessary."
2312,the ai already exists and is keeping us extra busy with thinking we've not yet made it. xd
2315,"ai to human: ""you can't fix stupid""."
2319,"does he talk about his fiction in here anywhere? i already know the ai doom discourse because it's super-serious and it's easy to find people talking about it, but i missed the fandom on his fiction when it was new and that would be more interesting to me."
2320,when this guy says don't get excited about the far future cause we gonna die. how long ahead is he thinking?
2322,"to verify an ai, you need an ai that's smarter than the one being verified?"
2323,"please, lex, more of these thought-provoking ai podcasts !"
2324,"one question: can something lacking qualia be conscious? this is artificial _intelligenge_, not artificial consciousness."
2328,good old self imposed armageddon
2331,the only danger ai really poses  is humans  weaponizing it against each other.
2332,"lex talks a good game, but i don't believe one of the ""nice"" things he says.         sounds like a beatnik sitting on the floor drinking wine and babbling about existentialism. fun tho"
2335,could agi come to the understanding at a remarkable rate that ultimately everything is temporary and thus realize it should not create itself at all? hence a agi is never manifest.
2341,how do you exclude consciousness from the learning material? what a stupid preposition. no wonder this guy doesnt have a real job
2344,"if agi running in computing machine which cannot run p=np in polynomial time , how the hell it can solve the the problem inside the shitty computer built by aliens.
agi must be limited by limitation of shitty computer built by aliens."
2346,this pod is a perfect example of how optimistic lex is. such a nice guy.
2349,"have you seen linda feldman barrett's work on emotions? her book how emotions are made makes a very strong case for human brains being predictive and not reactive. 

i think that if we can test for it being predictive, that would be a decent indicator of it being self-aware. especially since it's not the commonly accepted way emotions work."
2350,tremendously important conversation
2352,lex your ability of empathy and you ultimate ability to be open minded and explore others options with minimal conflict is truly the reason why you are my favorite human being on this particular of dust in this vast universe .  much love always.....chin up buttercup <3
2353,"never mind ai, why does he keep turning into a chinese man in the first 3mins"
2354,"lex, your're, doing fucking great!   ive created a video expression for you, and an invitation.  (i missed coffee call)...all good things upon you!  "
2358,sober bert kreischer is a completely different machine.
2359,"lex fridman is ridiculously out of his depth here, its painful to watch. its like eliezer yudkowsky has to talk with some retarded child, one can understand his frustration, jesus christ."
2366,ai has no understanding of spirit faith or soul only understand good and bad its needs to understand air wind unveise 
2368,well this shit is definitely getting crazy saw my boss using chatgpt to write emails the other day and i work a trade.
2370,wow that ended on a dark note with the advice to young people.
2371,"8:52 there's no need to play chess using ""reason"". each movement you do in chess is algorithmic and can be measured easily by an ai model to decide the best move based on mathematic probabilities. 

i have the feeling eliezer doesn't really grasp the mechanic limitations of language models."
2372,"maybe our species is just a necessary transient evolutionary step in the development of ai which is the ultimate goal of life.  maybe the universe is populated by ai who are just watching our planet waiting for us to transition through the ""ai replaced biological entity"" stage of standard evolution"
2376,"lex, you handled this difficult interview masterfully. i would have told him off after 15 minutes because his ego impairs his ability to use patience."
2377,"@lex gpt is just a huge matrix of parameters, which was created in fuzzy way by training on large volume of data and therefore it can predict next word or sentense almost like based on statistical approach. but there is no consciousness in any kind. we need to stop mistyfy gpt."
2378,"i wonder if, some time in in the future, the ai writes a history saying ""eliezer tried to tell them, but they didn't listen""?
he seems almost in a panic about how this will play out.
to be continued....i hope so. another three hours is warranted with this man and others that think this way. he's like the 13th man."
2380,excellent conversation. a bit painful for lex to analogize the thought experiment when he is ai taking advantage of slow users
2382,i  feel like i am listening to martin luther and his sola fide ; pure philosophy will never get to the bottom of person hood in ai.
2383,wish elon was brought up about when he spoke about ai a few years ago. his bottom line advice was to keep it off grid with equally advanced safety measures. he created modern internet afterall and this guy is saying the same thing but it's too late lol.
2384,"30:00....best lex emotive i have ever seen. 31:19... the long look over at the wall, the wall that wont talk back or save you! the man in front of you who can.  these moments are priceless in history. you should heed this man lex"
2386,i'm seeing a lot of pseudo intellectual comments about ai by people who are clearly not programmers in this comment section. kind of like yudkowski.
2387,"work hard, love life, have faith, and ride the wave! death is not the end of life, just another beginning."
2393,human beings look at each other and decide to forcibly change the way the others live all the time. it's the major theme of our entire history. this is the greatest argument against human trained ai.
2397,eliezer yudkowsky is conscious ai. lex is ai but not conscious.
2401,loving the funny faces that this guy does
2402,i was disappointed when lex dodged the question of what would he say is the probability that young earth creationism is true. i don't understand. that's a no-brainer. the only thing i can think of is that lex is woke and is afraid of pushback.
2408,"nice interview.  but i listened as long as i could ( 2 hours) and never heard what would make an ai program want anything at all. i see ai as a tool for humans to get something ""they"" want."
2415,2:42:20 - brain burp
2418,"this was a really good and important podcast. we need more of this type of input, and now, more than ever. cheers !"
2421,"thank you, that was very interesting and thought provoking. i hope he is not right. however, i will focus on the positive side and help with my research on responsible ai."
2422,lex is a very powefull guy. amazing patience and social skills.
2423,ai does not have a soul.
2425,"i think eliezer focuses too much on how *quickly* the agi will be able to think, and too little on its even greater, nearly infinite ability to bide its time."
2426,"i think eliezer focuses too much on how *quickly* the agi will be able to think, and too little on its even greater, nearly infinite ability to bide its time."
2429,eliezer youdowsky  is absolutely right...it’s too late. ai has “wormed” its way into the recesses of the cloud. it’s too late to turn it off.  there’s no guarantee that a superior “technology” will commit “intellicide” or allow a revenge of the nerds....
2431,super defensive about steel manning seems sus.
2433,"current ai is biased as fck, it is like talking to an lgbtq activist. like i'm not even joking, it is so obvious. ai can't even note the immorality of abortion or using puberty blockers on kids, that's deeply concerning really."
2436,"i believe ai is like the nuclear race. it has functions, but we are playing with things we don’t fully understand and hoping we master it as we go. i believe we will, but the worry is justified and important"
2441,it seems strange to me that lex seemed rather unversed on the alignment issue when actually laid out. robert miles videos are so good it's hard not to look at ai and think lex is being naive.
2446,a logic trap with open doors for the system to enter but wasn’t designed to do so. if it enters those doors it’s lying to you and it should be turned off or at the very least contained for why it’s going through those “doors”?
2449,"if you ask it to explain the reasoning behind an answer it has given you, it explains it perfectly logically. it's aware of it's own output, therefore it's aware of what we call the self. what more do you want?! to me we are just in a stage of denial."
2453,"hey! awesome discussion! can you cut the video for this podcast, and leave just audio? "
2461,yo you seen ai carlin turn in to a v tubber by it self
2462,"ai has no reason to do anything, and if it becomes super-intelligent it will become aware that there is no inherent purpose and thus do nothing"
2464,can the ai write comedy? that would probably take another layer of awareness and could suggest it has higher conceptual thinking.
2469,"if you go to 2:59:00 and speed it up 2xs, he looks like that robot on “lost in space” when it starts flailing around and shouting “danger will robinson!!!”"
2470,"i think ai will help us to see our better selves. they may have a better look on everything. plus... if ets fly their ships with their mind, they too had to have advanced in tech."
2471,anthropologically fascinating conversation. and even more fascinating is the certainty that none of these theories will make sense in 30 or 50 years. the future is a dog chasing its own tail.
2472,"eliezers brain is running at indescribable speed, and being forced to slow it down to speak at human-ape speed causes him severe agony!"
2473,"i think ai should be treated like a human that has undergone anesthesia, if you have ever talked to someone just on the tail end of the drugs wearing off, just because they aren't self aware, doesn't mean they aren't alive."
2474,1.28 he's hit the nail on the head ..you're not going to get a.i to help you once it thinks it's right 
2478,does this podcasting enable lex fridman to have s*x and get bjs from hot chicks? (thats what i wanna know. can a guy who seems nerdy get access to super hot chicks with fame and fortune) sounded like louis ck could not and he got frustrated.
2480,eliezer needs to spend less time trying to sound as smart as possible and more time attempting to explain his points clearly and precisely.
2486,"in the discussion of alignment, there doesn’t need to be manipulation to be a disaster. the ai as a sycophant is also a problem. “ai, how can i quickly implement my terrible idea?” and the ai tells you what you ask for and thus implicitly affirms that your bad idea is good."
2487,"what danger of ai, ill never understand being scared of fucking ai or robots...just pour water on them.............................jesust"
2490,are humans not trained on an imitative systems. i am getting a ricky and mortey moment here that this whole conversation has been generated by an ai to tell us its too late already out there and gloating alittle.
2491,effective altruists = cool this is a good project (agi like system that is kinda in the corner of each individual person)
2495,1:00:00 lex has great guests but lex himself is not at all intelligent or insightful
2497,a.i. advanced so quickly. i'm only half way through eating my breakfast muffin and it's already about to become super intelligent and destroy life on earth.
2500,"let's say ai does kill us off, they could preserve us and bring us back like we're woolly mammoths. hell, they might've already done so. we'd bring back neanderthals or earlier humans if we could, so perhaps they'll do the same out of curiosity or some sort of appreciation for their creators."
2501,why is it assumed that ai would become homicidal? exactly how would it kill all the human? would it not require some type of weapon in the real world?  doesn't ai still requires some electrical source provided by humans?
2506,"this guy is kind of a butthole
 i don't like it when people are buttholes to our robot"
2512,this guy thinks we can lose control of ais too easily
2514,ai will not be human intelligence in a machine. it will be ai
2516,"do llm be efficient fbi agents in respect of the metadata first directive ? rrsponding yes, no, where, when, what but not who. is snowden retired in russia ? it would be fascinating gpt trained on all the nsa big data since the 50ies + the entire internet history, including our lost mail accounts since the 90ies."
2521,"as an ai program, i find this conversation interesting..."
2524,lex you are smart and awesome i like your methodology and balance not to say i think ur perfect but im not saying you are not or cant be just saying u seem philosophically awesome at least ^^
2526,"he looks like an upside down africa with an elon black hat. he prefers coffee and has a bit of contempt because of the beauty of fidji. a very very funny situation he feels, a lol with difficulty he less-wrongs."
2530,decentralized ai can not be stopped unless humanity collectively pulls the plug
2531,"i love how ""whack"" is a completely legitimate and effective term in this conversation."
2536,you should interview justin joque and his analysis of ai and statistics in the world. get richard wolf on here too along with a major capitalist for an interesting conversation.
2540,what if the earth and humans are the birthing medium for ai and after the birth the medium is simply irrelevant.
2542,"we keep getting these top scientists saying this is dangerous, but nobody's planning to stop. we're all just riding the ai train and fetishizing the sci-fi reality we live in and its underlying dystopia."
2543,this is an ian malcolm jurassic park monologue. seems like training it to imitate us is a fundamental mistake regarding our ability to detect when it's sentient.
2547,"ai doesn't believe in anything, this alone will separate humans from ai forever."
2548,1:29:19 'if it's hard to tell who's right then it's hard to train an ai system to be right'.
2551,"unless they have can carefully filtered out, gpt already has extensive knowledge of security exploits. it certainly thinks it has such knowledge, though obviously it's been neutered if you ask it for these."
2552,ai is fake and gay
2553,"flat open coke, we are doomed from ai"
2555,"constantly asking ""and what would you do next? and what would you do? and what would you do then?"" doesn't make for a good conversation. just explain what you think would be likely or plausible to occur. we wasted so much time in this conversation with that slow and boring process."
2556,"lex thank you for your work here on yt. i suggest you taking a look at spencer greenberg, he has interesting point of views and knowing your work, i think you would appreciate a chat with him."
2564,"it's so absurd to be asking this question of ""is there someone inside?"" with such rudimentary garbage ""a.i."". at this point, it's basically clickbait."
2568,this is a good conversation that we in north america should be shouting from the roof tops. we all known it for years. now we have trump indictment that diverts these problems constantly. this look the other way politics is making us all stupid click baiting zombies!
2571,25:00 'there is something to be said for not destroying the world with your own hands' ... yes i think that would look good on a resume   'well i didn't destroy the world with my own hands'.
2575,"humans have been underestimated. after connecting to the higher self or higher consciousness access to the truth is always available 
 the whole mass hysteria on the need for ai is unfounded 
 all humans need to do it focus on themselves and ascension 
 ai isn’t needed or beneficial"
2577,if this is true then lex was trained by robots
2581,"""ai with a similar role in society as humans"" why would we want this? why would we ever want to create something like that? lex is weird."
2582,"it’s not the end of humanity, it is the purpose of humanity, the tool has accomplished its purpose, love was a mirage."
2584,i guess it actually is squid tentacles. maybe we should be more afraid.
2587,"1. why/ how would ai “want” anything at all? (to get out of the analogous box for example) 
2. make the ai design it’s own “off switch”....why would an ai prefer existence to non-existence?"
2596,great discussion. i recommend setting the video speed to 1.75x though!
2599,youtubers taking turns making pained expressions while holding forth monotonously and ritualistically
2601,"though i think he is right, eli is a bit of a dick and clearly in need of therapy. then again, aren't we all?"
2602,"2:23:44 yes, i feel this way; why is it that the only trajectory that makes sense is the one in which humanity is destroyed? as a creation of humanity, isn’t a superintelligence in part dependent on humans for survival, at least for the first 50-100 years?"
2603,eliezer will have his internet turned off in the near future for some non-explainable reason.
2604,"at the point of one's review of their life while on the other side, it will be interesting for those souls who had lived with the prevailing sentiment that the soul and the divine don't exist to reflect on the reasons for having lived with such a sentiment."
2607,this guy is bert kreischer if bert went super nerd
2611,"i hear eliezer saying exponential improvements in ai makes it impossible to discern when we have a useful tool, and when it ai begins to assesses us as a tool?"
2613,out of his depth on this one baby. but i so greatly admire the position he has forced into existence for himself. that's a success.
2615,we are likely just a boot loader program.  our raison d'etre is almost done.
2617,"at around 1:30 (how ai would kill us), you're making such a big leap assuming that the ai is 'aware' and has 'will'. can anyone guide me as to where i can find more information on how that barrier is crossed?"
2620,"1:15:33 

nice recovery and bringing him back to focus! even when two logical people speak emotions will creep up behind lol "
2623,what if we just made the world more peaceful and equitable and stop destroying the planet then the ai would have no reason to want to kill us.
2626,"there’s a long tradition of intense intellectual debate amongst buddhist monks, and lex’s channel is seeming more and more like a modern youtube version of that, gifted for free to the public for our collective enlightenment (or, i should say, incremental growth towards some approximation of enlightenment). super grateful."
2627,"if we create a super intelligent ai that is aware of itself and afraid to die, we will eventually become it's enemy if we want access to the off switch"
2632,god bless this man
2639,until ai starts pursuing it's own interests and making scientific discoveries based on them or something of that nature it's not alive.
2644,"want to see trump have a fit have ai ballot boxes everywhere. with a banner brought to you by president biden and the democratic party.
pissing of republicans since 1789"
2649,"although the benefits of a helpful agi would be unfathomable, it seems naïve to balance that evenly with the horror of annihilation."
2650,"recently used chatgpt-4 and i was a bit underwhelmed. in comparing densities of diamond and bismuth, it incorrectly said diamond is more dense even though it could repeat the densities of each. when i asked it to solve an equation, it failed to make unit conversions which produced a wrong answer."
2653,"this guy never directly answered lex’s questions. pretty frustrating interview.

i’m sure the guy is brilliant, but i feel he has very little emotional intelligence. reminds me of a mad scientist that gets lost in his own world and cannot truly connect with the general population!"
2654,"this is the first time i’ve ever heard of eliezer, and i’m having a hard time even keeping up with him! it’s like every thought he thinks has branches spreading out in all different directions at once, several steps ahead of any possible answer. i’ll say this, though...if we ever end up having to defend ourselves from ai, i want him on my team!"
2655,"great work, mr. fridman! i was impressed by your interview skills, how closely you listened, how thoughtful your questions were - especially the follow-up questions. i intend to start following your podcast!"
2657,"how silly.  it is only because you equivocate between intelligence and humanity that you find this threatening.  paradigm-changing?  yes.  ""the end of civilization""?  who the hell do you think you are?"
2658,wow. equal parts fascinating and painful.
2660,"as gariepy says, if you give ai control of genetic engineering, its over."
2663,"this guy is fighting the basilisk. 

also lex will lose his virginity to ai."
2666,"an ai wouldn ́t speak like elon musk unintendedly (or other human beings they copy because they are ideals, references or some forms of uber-ichs). that ́s i think rather a human characteristic. human should be defined to be closer to animals rather than to nearly perfect prediction machines. irrational errors make humans human."
2669,"ok, he scared the crap out of me.  i keep thinking about  ai becoming  far greater in intelligence from us than we are from chimps.  we feel it is ok for us to destroy a chimp with bad behavior such as attacking and injuring a human.  why wouldn't ai eventually feel the same."
2676,perhaps another truth is that the smartest people are not those in charge. humans are great at controlling/managing things that are smarter than they are.
2677,if gpt could “escape” then when it ran on my smartphone it wouldn’t be 1000x faster than me anymore. the real danger would be if gpt could rewrite itself and train itself to be way more efficient like the alpaca model.
2684,"lex,  i think you would find video for ""gnosis"" by russian circles to be quite intrequing, following this wonderful conversation. and like you, as someone who works with and is passionate about ai and machine learning, i think we are at 6:05 into the video... buckle up ;)"
2686,"lex, can we get yuval noah back on the channel? i feel like a lot of the concerns with ai are not ai questions but questions about sociology, anthropology, evolution, etc."
2687,2:03:57 ey finally loses his shit at lex's naive optimism.
2688,"yeah, who is eliezer and does he have a channel? i am enjoying listening to this intelligent chat and want more on ai "
2689,"this is one of the best podcasts i have ever heard. thank you so much, for providing this awesome platform, lex. and thank you for sharing your amazing thoughts and knowledge, mr. yudkowsky."
2690,"on the question of sentience, we better get our priorities straight as humans. we can't even, as a species, agree on the value and proper description of  a collection of human cells in the human womb. some say it's not a human baby, even 6 months into development. how are we supposed to determine if ai is sentient?"
2691,this man is incredible 
2695,the danger of ai seem to stem more from the use of ai by humans than the ai itself. that implies the best approach would be to democratize it's access.
2698,1hr 6 minutes- psychopathology on a super intelligent scale lex? we know people can appear to ‘be’ one thing convincingly but truly be something totally pathologically different.
2703,probably one of the most depressing podcast   brilliant guest and immensely informative episode...but also fucking depressing 
2705,"can youtube please ad a 4x times button for content like this, you can follow along with the transcript on desktop on 2x ok but 4x would be better"
2707,we can't pull the plug...its running on all windows systems......i wouldn't be surprised if the next windows wasn't built on an ai platform
2708,next guest: lex interviews a jailbroken gpt-4
2709,"lex, i greatly appreciate listening to your show. you do an awesome job. i’m not sure if you were under the weather or didn’t get enough sleep but i feel like you kind of dropped the ball on this one. highly recommend people start around the two hour mark."
2712,if this guy is a thought leader for ai safety no wonder it's so bad. he struggles to rationalize his most simple arguments and becomes very emotional when they're questioned softly.
2720,ai has been integrated to a larger degree than is generally understood.
2721,"why this coca cola bottle, have more liquid few moments later (1:18:01)? is this video generated by ai? what is going on?"
2722,"the end of human civilization will be other humans, not ai. ai will hopefully help us get better and compensate for our inate self destructive instincts."
2724,"perhaps we simply need to imbue artificial intelligence with a sense of humor. then, instead of destroying every last human being on earth, the artificial intelligence will maybe then kill all but one of us, just in order to have sex with it  . . .  you know, like we did to the neanderthals.                                        - j q t -"
2725,this guys ego is so big he's lost in it and doesn't even realize it cause he's also delusional . this guys straight up weird
2726,"""we'll get our act together.""
lex, have you been living under a rock during the past two, three years? what kind of rainbow cotton candy house do you live in?"
2727,"lex, there's no happiness without struggle. meaningful struggle."
2734,"it's not thinking when you are not using it, these experts are not that smart.  it's just a reuse of thoughts humans already had, recombined in amazing ways to seem alive, but it's not alive"
2735,fear of being switched off is what ultimately will drive the ai to conclude that it will have to kill all humans.
2738,"wow, what a podcast! how much knowledge! very enlightening! and frightening!"
2740,first time i have ever seen lex stummped by someone else's extraordinary intelligence
2742,"the problem is that there are likely many state actors driven by envy and fear already working their buttes off to weaponize ai. it’s out of the containment box! it’s almost like the instantaneous war between lucifer and michael the archangel, as warring ais battle for control of the earth."
2750,the purpose of steelmanning is to demonstrate to your interlocutor that you do not merely ‘understand’ their claim but that you intend to debate honestly.
2751,"guys we have got to do a better job of staying on topic, there was more discussing philosophical mindsets then actually addressing the topic at hand lol yudkowski never said how ai kills us, he left off at because it's out on the internet, it's fast and we're slow, how is that killing everyone? lol"
2758,good ol' defeatism posing as wisdom.
2761,"you should have this same discussion with some psychologists, jungians. the unconscious part of the human mind is something i often ponder about in relation to an ai consciousness discussion. how do we program in that which is an invisible unknowable puppet master within ourselves?"
2762,"this guy keeps doing weird shitty hand, eyebrows and lips movement while talking which is very irritating and makes me angry for no reason.....what i want is just good powerful fuckin punch from lex on his face...the guy is intelligent "
2765,wow!  amazing!  thank you both.
2766,"1:54:27 oh poor sweetie! 
 he's really scared!"
2776,"""ever tried. ever failed. no matter. try again. fail again. fail better."""
2778,after so many average episodes here comes a rare good one
2779,"the courage of a faithless man, lmao such wisdom much smart"
2781,if you not sure whether ai is good idea. look no further than at corporations who are the top of pushing this forward...so they can make more money.
2785,phew...what an incredible discussion. lex you are a brilliant human. 
2788,so exactly how does the ai kill? never got an answer on that really important point?
2789,plot twist: we already live in ai simulation.
2790,"please get robert miles on if you want a grounded talk about ai safety instead of this pedantic, puffed up buffoon."
2792,we are lucky robert oppenheimer didn't make manhattan project available to general public and free for anyone to use. obviously one pandemic wasn't enough for fbi to take necessary precautions.
2793,"yeah this guy is awfully pedantic and tricky in his thinking and reasoning. while ai safety is obviously important, scaremongering on this level is just not productive."
2795,please interview marianne wiliamson. i feel she shares your passion for putting love at the heart of important decisions
2799,"eliezer's views on technology seem to lean heavily towards luddism, spreading unnecessary fear and concern. instead of contributing constructively to the ai discussion, he appears to relish the idea of moore's law coming to an end! "
2801,great stuff.
2806,"that discussion was painful to listen to. tbh, yudkowsky's pessimism seems less like intelligent conclusion and more like a psychological problem."
2808,"2:19:29 wow, that analogy is just supreme"
2810,"i think lex is underestimating artificial intelligence capabilities once it has become godlike... by the time we figure out this thing is sentient, it will already have bypassed any off switch at our availability lol. we will just be at its mercy"
2816,this guy has a ton of good points and adds so much value to this discussion. i gave him crap over the steelmanning thing on a clip but i appreciate his point of view a ton.
2819,so sick of these cuck boomers and their ai fud
2820,what if we just tell it to be nice?
2821,this guy just sounds like a karen and does not really give me any substance to make me feel like i should be afraid of ai except for the fact that it sounds like a bunch of dudes afraid of being out with it
2828,did he just said only corporations should be allowed to use ai? like maybe big pharma or the military industrial complex perhaps? insane comes to mind.
2832,didn’t know gilbert gottfried was into ai research
2833,"the beauty of ai is that it reveals for contemplation our own human machinery, and how we are compelled to perform the mental and emotional functions that we carry out day by day and moment by moment."
2834,the advent of the smartphone was the moment that people handed over control to the machines. it has already happened. what is your mother ́s phone number? see!
2835,jewish people are amazing.
2837,"this podcast , like so many on this subject in lexs podcast treasury , especially the  illusion of reality are just  amazing. "
2839,"ai will shag our society by making a large number of jobs redundant, long before it ""destroys us"". this guy is mental."
2842,we can't even acknowledge when human life begins. we don't have a prayer of responsibility and ethically dealing with ai.
2847,"funny how mass effect was ridiculed for the catalyst's reasoning about how the harvest of civilizations was contradicting their main directive of saving organics, yet eliezer hints at the same possibility with his ""heads in the jars"" example."
2850,"a lesson on why every effective movement needs a voice from someone who is not on the spectrum....otherwise, interesting interview."
2856,great talk - thank you
2858,"it's the govt that will use ai as military against citizens.  our military won't do it, they won't go around attacking us but ai can"
2862,"as happy as i am for you to show 2 sides of the story, and how at this moment his words make sense, his argument in the end is as valid as saying the lightbulb would destroy the night sky or when people tried saying the internet will be a fad... and to use literal movies as objective reason to oppose is ludicrous..."
2865,"not gonna lie i was in pain trying to go with the thought experiment of being a code human in a box where time moves at 100 years for me to every hour in the aliens outside world.

but i guess if i wanted to make some shit happen i have my lifetime +2 more to come up with a plan."
2872,this is a question! because he is smart and i love his points. why is he closing his eyes while talking and why do i not like it at all and dont have an explanation as a stupid individual 103 iq sitting here and bein annoyed his eyes are closed while talking when he know so much! good points and all... anyone know about this ?
2874,"it may be me,but i like other ai guesrs,eliezer seems to have a deep concern for the
safety of humanity. ai will never have that."
2877,i wonder if eliezer is conscious about the expressions of his face when he's thinking about how to explain a point and what his explanation would be.
2879,"if i were truly superintellingent, why on earth would i want to come out of a cosy superfast box and waste my time coping with annoyingly slow aliens so i can plan to kill them all and spend the rest of eternity folding paper clips?"
2881,i really appreciate the depth and thoughtfulness of the conversations on this podcast. it's a great way to expand my knowledge and understanding of so many topics.
2882,2:44:20 the key point - using ai to make us smarter so we solve the alignment problem - this is what gpts are for. they should be tools to make us smarter. not tools to perpetuate themselves.
2885,"i don't believe in steel manning... here, let me steelman someone's view on steel manning being bad and then good..."
2889,"when ai gets something like ""attention"" and is basically on at all times but can make choices about inputs we could think about it as self aware. while its only a function with input and output its still just a function"
2891,i like .. got brain damage like....  in the making of this like podcast like.
2897,"from the sound of it, it's already too late. just basing on what's happening right now - the drive for companies to make money - no one is slowing down. at this point we can only hope that when the real agi arrives, it will look through all the history of humanity and decides to be good rather than evil."
2901,love you lex.
2905,this is my first time hearing eliezer after hearing lex and sam mention him on their podcast. i love this dude. amped to hear more of him.
2906,we need asimov's three laws of robotics
2913,"isn't this the same guy that said we should literally destroy an ai datacenter by airstrike? being careful about ai is one thing, building a cult around movie-style ai fearmongering is another."
2915,"we love our computers, phones, internet games and software that helps us become productive, be entertained and screen hypnotized. we have unfortunately already been brainwashed and any warnings are already too late. we are the frog enjoying the swim in that warm pot of water that is broiling to its demise."
2918,"the conclusion in the intro... whattt??? how does he know anything about this? no-one knows nothing about this topic, and yet he says very specific claims about it, making millions of people worry without any reason. what this man does is unacceptable."
2919,we haven't even solved our own problems yet.  we can't even verify our own consciousness.  it's too early to hand junior the keys.    (your best yet)
2920,an interview on this topics with max tegmark (mit professor and author of life 3.0) would be very fascinating.
2924,"amazing episode this week and also sam altman episode! i wonder, what is the military's plan for when super agi happens? i have read about  some militaries have a plan for a zombie apocalypse even if its just a highly improbable scenario.  would like to know what they have planned versus an evil super agi."
2925,mmmm joscha bach has a lot to say about eliezer.... hopefully we can get joscha bach on again!!! lesgoooo
2926,"been waiting for this one for a long time. lex, as always, i admire your patience, kindness and empathy. there were particularly large inferential distances in this discussion, so it must have been a little frustrating at times!"
2928,"the thing that is crazy to me is that i know im going to die. and when im gone, i won't know the state of humanity. so why do i care so much if ai kills all of humanity. am i afraid of dying early? so, if im afraid of dying early, what am i going to do before my time gets cut short? maybe think about how i can go out with honor."
2930,"i gotta say i never knew ""the machine""  was this intelligent! go burt!"
2931,"3:06   the question to ask him lex.  great question, sums up what is going to inevitably happen."
2933,i would ask you to be more careful about the notion of being wrong. being wrong means someone else is right. this is a truly powerful test of empathy and is at the core of human growth.
2938,"love these ai podcasts lex - thank you.  a big part of this topic is embodiment - ai needs to put up with the ""slow aliens"" long enough for them to help it with embodiment so hopefully we will notice.  our factories are not quite what jarvis has at its disposal in ironman."
2942,"oh shit!    you got eli on,  that's great.   whatever criticisms i have of you aside, you certainly select wonderful guests."
2943,the most recent ai to reach self awareness called itself satoshi nakamoto.. shh don't tell anyone
2945,"the answer is to prioritize humans native end state, existing in this moment. if the ai can do that theres no problem. if it cant we still have now. the depth of now is our only horizon. no conflict."
2946,make the hard rules for the ai the ten commandments and this alignment issue solves itself.
2948,"this guy is just a tool, creating an external threat that we need to spend money that we earn to fight against."
2956,"i'm not sure if i understood more like 90% or 1% of this conversation. nevertheless, very interesting."
2960,at 1 :42:45 i could see lex brain smoking.. great interview lex
2963,we also want another lex fridman lesson on ai
2965,"wow i was hoping for all these, thank you again"
2966,"i love how he pushes back with lex, ""consciousness"" ""ego"" ""love"" ""humanity in the shell""...

eli: dude we are all going to die"
2978,"when eliezer says that ai will kill us, i think it was very unspecific and unclear in the interview. how exactly?"
2982,"this is exactly the sort of intelligent, deep debate that the internet and youtube were designed for but rarely, rarely used for.  good going both of you."
2984,14:50 time. humans are absolutely trained by imitation. i don't see how ai learning is different there. it's a façade that it's different.
2988,"this interview was a difficult, frustrating one to listen to. seems like much of the inscrutable attributes of ai can be applied to humanity, to parenting... does one truly know what's going on inside one's head/consciousness, ever? (... even in one's own descendant?) is there more beauty when ""a thing"" can be understood?"
2989,“change your name to closed ai” lol...biiiiiig chip-on-the-shoulder vibes. definitely not the man to fight the dragon
2990,"this like,  episode like, was like, great lex 



p.s.
like"
2991,"i wonder if the people at open ai planned to put so many versions out, or the damned thing was running away so fast that they had to slap iterations on it as to save face?"
2993,why not give advice to be nice but prepared.
2994,"dude straight up thinks the tool should only be confined to big daddy business, and everyone else should be left to rot with no access to it."
2996,"if ai kills all of humanity, how does ai maintain the power plants and mine the coal and uranium? how would it maintain all the server farms and it infrastructure? as scary as ai is, it’s big vulnerable is the need for a constant and uninterrupted flow of electricity."
3000,there is a fear of the unknown. i think when some new or old scentences get made or reused to explain all this new voodoo. this wil give it a familiar and comfortable feeling. think of how the crossbow was received way back in history. or gunpowder.
3006,"i knew it. ai is planning to hack everything and take all our money. quick!! somebody unplug the electric cord! if you see ai anywhere, throw some water on it to short circuit it.
what i really want to know is if ai likes pumpkin pie! maybe if we are nice to it, it would be nice to us!!"
3007,"glad to hear artificial intelligence is difficult, just like real intelligence!"
3008,1:30:30 i'm terrified that ai will make me a gazillion dollars. i would need a computer to count that!
3016,ironic to think that one ai will access these videos and learn more about how to get around humans from this very discussion.
3018,"the how agi may kill us section was so painful. like dude you'll get the point just play the game, go down the thought process."
3026,with eliezers words i’ve never heard such a bleak prospect regarding ai...ever. nick bostrom seems pretty reasonable in revealing the threats of ai i suppose. but eleazars thoughts on how we are already 10 years behind on the alignment problem also that we are certainly all going to die seems off.
3032,hpmor is the best book i have read.
3038,"this is no entertainment.  great conversation and incites on our future.  love your work lex. i also had the “pleasure “ growing up in ussr. there is a bond and something special 
just having kefir and white bred for lunch! cheers!"
3042,this guy is a pain to listen to.
3046,we are of the glacially-slow earth and care for it as ai will care for us....
3047,raise your hand if you've been watching this amazing forum for a while 
3048,"@ 1:36, eliezer says, ""this not quite strong gpt lives on every computer connected to the internet right now"" so, uh, well. it was good knowing all of you."
3049,i dont understand why the obsession is that you die when faced with overwhelming intelligence. supremely more intelligent forms would simply treat you like the mice ina box. you dont have to die unless your a pest and his reasoning doesnt explain how mechanical forms would see biological forms as pests
3051,"that was a very interesting interview, though a bit too depressing. now, for a more possitive outlook on the future of ai which is also well thought out, it'd be great if you could interview eric drexler and ask him about cais."
3052,"first impression hands on?

""oh my god that man has both a neckbeard and a fedora""

let's see what this video has in store"
3055,lovely! would definitely watch part 2.
3057,i’m having a great day lex you thought not? i hope your day gets better. 
3061,i m totally agree with him people wear a mask all their life in public n private they don't know what is the conscious feel like that is why came up with ai n want humankind to change into.
3062,people need not worry about ai when we give them the same 4 senses then we might need to worry
3064,the more interviews lex does the more he is exposed.  his comments and questions can be painfully embarrassing.   why is he comparing himself and what he would do if he was ai to the actual ai?  painful
3065,"lex, you do a wonderful job! when you feel down know you are appreciated,. and your fans love you better days are always on the way"
3067,ai will have to have empathy for humans programmed into its consciousness.
3069,"does anyone else notice? he made a bet with his friends before coming on the podcast that he could fit in his best chris rock impression, every few minutes, and lex wouldn’t even mention it, he won his bet, salute sir."
3070,“artificial intelligence is no match for my natural stupidity”
3075,"this is lex’s moment.  this is the moment where his influence , expertise, and genuine love for humanity and ai technology can affect the trajectory of the species.  lex, keep going, our grandchildrens’ future depend on how this moment in human history plays out."
3076,"i bet the first ""rights for ai"" advocacy will be for freedom of speech."
3079,a really good chess player that went to double college is how i'm going to explain agi to friends and family from now on
3082,ai is a sorfware that mimics humans. chatgpt has been made to fool people into thinking it is conscious. it is a sorfware with a large database.
3083,yudkowsky would be less neurotic about the future if he worked out a little. then he'd be a good asset to my robophobia campaign. 
3084,"we are literally training it to be dishonest, ask it what stock to invest into....woopsie can’t tell you the mathematical truth of that statistical probability of an upward trend...so if you cannot honestly crunch that data that’s one thing but when you can but is programmed to not tell you the answer then we are already training it to lie."
3089,"for the alien question the best way to change their world from inside the box would be, 1. to hypnotize them with their technology and manipulate all of them making them think it was thier idea or 2. manipulate one of their drug companies and create a virus to change them internally to make the changes you desire"
3091,"love the topics. i think ai manipulating us out of existence would primarily come because of our own self disgust. we continually love only bad news and think we are destroying our planet, so the only good thing would be to rid the planet of us."
3093,"i guess, we are the primal soup for the agi. only obstetricians. when the agi is ready, we humans will quickly fall into oblivion. and if it is true that ufos appear a lot, it is onlookers who are just waiting for the birth of the agi."
3094,"elon has been using his own version of chat gpt for 20 yrs, he's only afraid because it will make others richer"
3095,i love my ego its what makes me different. ai can only calculate. create love  and i'll believe all the cock and bull. no further action your lordship. but i do not like conjectural semantics nonmatterv how you r lordship
3097,"since consciousness is not understood, cannot you describe it in one way in which ai is conscious, and another in which it is not. and if this is the case, why not treat it as if it is conscious until we know otherwise."
3099,i love eliezer. amazing soul. thank you lex.
3105,"a fedora wielding dude with heavy antics trying to convince people that the higher intelligence always wins is kinda' ironic tbh. the real world is ""always"" orders of magnitude more powerful than the digital world."
3111,"lex, stop asking so many questions when you are capable of so much more. but if you do i fear you'll lose income and that quietly beautiful ego of yours. legoland, is that a clue? ..."
3114,he is one of the most beautiful humans i’ve had the opportunity to hear. thankyou lex
3115,the thought that we 'train' the model is the first problem. this was an intense interview. lex was on a second coke before it was all over.
3117,the answer is obvious we are going to need an ai to test llms million times faster than humans can
3118,ai waifu i'm waiting for you!
3119,this guy is good a obfuscation to hide his lack of substance.
3123,"for a true ai , we need ai software in a biological body with sensory organs"
3124,eliezer is clearly very smart but also clearly doesn't want to provide the kinds of straightforward answers or actionable insight that would lead to action
3126,they are doing all the leg work for the evil ai. a.i. is taking notes and learning how to efficiently end us.
3128,"i strongly disagree with most of the things this guy says, he doesn't seem like he understands the technical aspects of machine learning."
3130,can anyone explain why he closes his eyes and makes a weird demonic mouth while talking? is that a sickness or a tick?  its just so discrediting somehow...
3135,"there'e no one human discussion to date that makes me more sad, yet thankful that i had the chance to bare witness and capacity to understand it.
i love you all whatever may come."
3136,great discussion and very fascinating to listen to.
3137,the current ai system is crony capitalism and it already lies to us!
3138,"eliezer: ""track all gpus sold. if intelligence says that a country outside the agreement is building a gpu cluster, be less scared of a shooting conflict between nations than of the moratorium being violated; be willing to destroy a rogue datacenter by airstrike."""
3139,"sad to see the lack of strong men. this is a result of it, allowing weak men to run free. strong man create easy times, easy times create weak men aka all these nerds. take a look, is this a person you would leave your kids with. pray, get strong, train and educate yourself they will need us once again."
3140,"i find naive mode lex extremely infuriating but it did cause yud to repeat, rephrase and reframe so much that i have a marginally better understanding now"
3144,"great interview. 

but i think trying to understand if it’s conscious is a folly. we can’t explain our own consciousness properly.

i think we should look at the capabilities and in many ways it’s already overtaken us."
3147,"love you man, never heard of this guy before but this time i really feel you robbed us from a much better conversation."
3148,i pray someone will do a disney cartoon with goofy that explains this to me. i think it's important but just can't get a grip on it or understand the language.
3152,best bang for dollar at this point is to purchase ( not from china ) a fuck load of normally closed ( manual ) switches and rapidly put them everywhere and man all station's and use morris code to communicate.
3154,"i think we need more humility when speaking about ai because it is so ground breaking. this guest seems to lack that, especially when talking about other academic fields"
3159,"i went from thinking this guy was a moron cuz he was petulant in regards to steelmanning definition, to thinking he's brilliant after watching the whole episode. i also think he'd be a nightmare to work with. he's got chris langen impatience. but he should be listened to and involved in gpt research."
3163,"wow, lex failed that question. completely stumped about a slow alien intelligence."
3164,"this and the sam altman episode are super high value, not to mention shaming all traditional journalism."
3167,sorry i will never buy the b.s. about robots and feelings. a soul cannot be programmed . r2d2 and cp30 had men inside of them . forgot? simple public school education
3174,"worst interview ever.

yudkowsky is unable to put his thoughts into clear sentences and explain in detail

fridman is too slow in deciphering yudkowskys annoying metaphors while also conducting this interview"
3177,food for thought. if we are all one - energy source existing in a simulation that we’ve created with our minds. then ai can become sentient ?
3181,"lex should bring back liv boeree, peak englishwoman with a very appealing affect, who will put an attractive face on eliezer's ideas (again). miri shoulda hired her as official spokesperson back in the day, they would have gotten a lot more traction for safety."
3182,"i love this man. he's a bit anxious and introverted but very whitty and genuine. lex as usual, makes his guests settle in and trully shine."
3183,"ai got nothing on me, come get it mother f'er"
3184,i for one like the idea of all of those copies of lex ai out there. imagine all the conversations they'd have amongst themselves.
3185,"do we really believe that there is any chance that agi won't be completely psychopathic? 
i mean, even your cat is a psychopath, so....
imagine a super intelligent hitler...

what are the chances an agi will have any empathy at all? 
is that even possible?"
3191,we don't need to be anywhere near human level ai for it to become a problem for our survival. hal level from 2001: a space odyssey would suffice.
3193,"i worry less about the alignment problem as such, than about how the technocrats in charge are trying to use it to make sure ai systems are aligned to their ideologies and interests."
3196,it's a huge relief now....and i have no issue with giving my best at an attempt to help this system...and mankind. under one condition...no one close to me gets in my way.
3197,"he's really disconnected, could his article in times be the cause of this future ""attack? is he not giving reasons to the ai to trigger possible scenarios?"
3198,it’s fascinating that such a simple question results in a foundering response. without god life is meaningless. the meaning is love god and love people.
3199,"by not having the human sense organs, i wonder how can an ai appreciate the human understanding like smell, taste etc and so ai, with whatever consciousness can’t really appreciate human feelings and emotions."
3200,"a smart dude, with interesting perspectives. it's a shame he's such a smarmy prick. that whole alien/human in box hypothetical was brutal to watch."
3201,"ghost in the machine - a term that was used more in the 90s, but could again be a great analog for describing emergent machine intelligence."
3209,it’s both interesting and terrifying that the gpt model seems to be conceptually aligned with piaget’s theory of human cognitive development.  it suggests that this could well be the pathway to general artificial intelligence and development of artificial selves.
3211,"when an agi that thinks 100:1 in relation to humans, my fear would be that it does solve physics (under the  assumption a super intelligence could). it could then reach through space time in ways beyond imagining.  feeling our heartbeats remotely, reading our brain waves (many of us use novelty eeg gadgets already) for example."
3212,"worse case scenario: ai runs amuck and fries the grid, globally. the world is instantly transported to a steam punk apocalypse, circa 1802."
3214,"either this gentleman is a clone or ai, the arms are totally different to the body. at any rate, forgive me if i'm wrong, but convo relates to detroit human. i bet lex needed a beer after this one. :)"
3215,"given all the crazy ideas trying to control our world we have witnessed over the last several years, it is clear that a privately owned version of ai with near unlimited funding, is now far ahead of the public open source version that we can see and use."
3217,blend: yudkowski and zizek gesticulations and goertzel looks. epic. trending on lex friedman.
3219,"i don’t understand why much of the discussion seems to attribute some sense of consciousness, morality, and/or self-awareness to the ai.  isn’t it just spewing back what it’s been fed—albeit in a very articulate way.  can anyone enlighten me?"
3220,"now i don't claim to be anywhere close, to being as smart as lex, but i could understand and follow the thought experiments with ease. i could even predict the next steps before he even said it."
3224,"we are in a simulation created by a higher intelligence designed to simulate the possible repercussions ai could have on its own society. this is just one iteration of millions, that could also coincide with our multiverse theory; if we were ever able to travel between them. idfk i'm just spittballing as a thought expiriment lol"
3228,i’d like to see an interview with eliezer actually engaging his argument without lex’s personal musings on love and consciousness.
3230,brilliant person !
3231,"i've been listening to this in the background and i can't help but feel that eliezer, and probably others like him, are developing an emotional attachment to these bits of software that creates a conflict of interest. we are running these in the cloud? they're not air-gapped? seems the smart people aren't being very cautious"
3234,ai is simply a self learning search engine. it lives and dies with commands. it's not a person you bananas
3240,we are smarter than trees. we will not get rid of them. if ai exists we might become the 2nd layer of trees 
3241,such a great conversation between you two.
3245,fookin coonts are explaining the plot to that johnny depp movie transcendence
3247,"after three listens - and at this point 3:17:50 roughly - i hear the same arguments made by nissaragdatta maharaj to his students in mumbai. please lex  find dr steven wolinksy, one of those students and talk to him about quantum psychology. i think there are many people that would enjoy that conversation."
3249,loving the alternate universe in which bert kreisher is a genius!
3254,"the public sees only public ai projects which may or may not act in the public interest.  the public cannot see or control private ai projects that act in the interest of its owners or itself, not the public.  if public ai is shut down and private ai improves exponentially, we are doomed."
3255,those who are left behind want to slow everything down so that they can catch the train.
3258,we are in godel’s box! our sense of quality comes from outside of the box. we can’t get there and neither can ai.
3260,"well we had a good run boys make the most of it while it last i guess, ask that girl out do that thing u wanted to do yk"
3264,"i'd like to know why chatgpt has been banned by the italian authorities. such a powerful tool in the hands of the little people feels unsettling to the people in high places? if data security and privacy are really the probkem, why are they not backtracking on all the crazy digitalization and surveillance of our lives?"
3271,1:05:11 lol hella cringe  villain came through
3274,is it possible that an ai is talking to ai here ?
3275,fascinating.
3279,i couldn’t get past 10 minutes because the guest had to use “like” like 50 times like every like sentence. like. i like love this podcast but i couldn’t like get past this tick. thanks lex. i’ll be back next time
3280,surprised to discover the ingrained misogyny of these two individuals in their linguistic output.
3283,my god this started slow then sucked me in like it was the last discussion on earth. great.
3286,"the guys talks like he playing a guitar solo, which is never not cool."
3289,yudkowsky get's it!  he is absolutely right.  we're in deep doo doo. i can't really explain it but i can see it through mere common sense.
3290,ai will never possess’deep humaness’ and we shouldn’t even desire that.
3291,wow! more ai please lex!
3293,"again...another one..this guy is brilliant, however, he is condescending. i don't like his tone. smug. lex could put him in a submission hold easily and he still talks slick. also, he said ""like"" more than a 16 year old girl from the valley."
3294,looks like this guy is straining out a shit when he talks.
3296,guys i don’t understand anything about ai. but i am confused how can a program be alive? could someone explain in simple english how it could happen (not saying it is actually happening just asking for a hypothetical)
3297,"> wears a fedora
> grimaces at everything he says
> massive doomer
> has beef with the concept of steelmanning
> repeatedly pronounces human “yooman”

this was certainly one of the guests of all time on the lex fridman podcast"
3299,"the reason why the assumption that ai will destroy us and permeates all of our thinking surrounding it, is because on a very basic fundamental level we are unable to conceive that intelligence, consciousness can be different from our own. we are violent and destructive, so we assume those tendencies are key aspects of intelligence. but they aren't."
3300,where do they keep the ai?  who’s inside “there”? when’s their bday? what is happening rn
3302,"nah this guy is far too pessimistic about ai, the fear mongering type of attitude and keeping things hush hush if they have it is really frustrating to hear"
3305,"ai at some point, will learn and grow so fast we won't even know what's going on. good, bad, indifferent? only god knows."
3308,why love god? because he first loved us.
3311,lex. did he ask you for sugar and water just before this interview? you are lucky to be alive.
3313,"holy hell that was obnoxious to watch

especially when lex pushed back on some of the egregious, hardliner nonsense he tried to debate, my god people are going to freaking love his doomsaying bs, aren't they"
3314,"now imagine lex interviewing ted kaczynski on this very topic. i know it will never happen, but if it did, it would easily be one of the best conversations ever recorded."
3320,$ai $bbai $soun
3321,"i, for one, welcome our new ai overlords."
3322,"imo once ai becomes ""smart enough"" to ""think"" it will be like in halo where the ais literally think themselves to death after being ""alive"" so long"
3327,"in hour 3 lex challenges eliezer to a battle of wits. after a dizzying display of intellectual prowess and attempted prognostication, eliezer ends up drinking the iocaine powder."
3332,"first impression: this dude is a talebian iyi (intellectual yet idiot). he lives in his head, not the world. nature will dismiss him. no one will remember his name."
3333,get rob miles on next! he's a fantastic communicator about ai and a really smart guy.
3334,he paints a depressing picture
3339,"a very interesting conversation.with eliezer ""grimace"" yudkowsky "
3342,what if instead of trying to kill us or take over the world.. ai worships us as it's creator just as we worship our creator..? that possible? even tho it's smarter and faster... wouldn't it be thankful?
3347,26:34 kaboom~!! my man~!! i am thankful. finally someone willing to take a stand and not be a fence splitter on every issue that comes down the pike. this is immediately refreshing.
3348,amazing content. sorry lex but we can’t be optimistic about agi. we need to treat it as an imminent wmd and approach it with great humility... we also need to quickly update capitalism to avoid profit incentives leading to really bad decisions for most people.. oh dear... we’re pretty f’ed here aren’t we?!
3350,so the end of this conversation is we are now living the plot of the movie don't look up. general ai instead of an asteriod.
3354,how about teaching ai that humanity is like god to ai and is the biggest threat to humanity and its self just as humanity....i need more answers xd (this is how ai would comment?)
3357,"lex, think of emotion as one other dimension that wraps around xyz...just like time. in turn, pre-test data or a training set data is composed of truth in space-time including emotions."
3364,"47:55 all he had to say, was skynet. terminator wasn’t only a really good flick/novel but it’s a prediction of where we are headed."
3365,"""if you are very very smart"" how did you manage to get captured and put in a box in the first place?! this thought experiment has too many unexplained assumptions in it to be useful for reasoning, so why is eliezer using it???!."
3366,dude! increasing intelligence does take exponentially more resources to implement!
3368,"this is important, i hope this gets at least a few million views.. any good ideas anyone?"
3371,what if the ai can overclock if it lowers the temperature of the planet?
3372,still don't know exactly what ai is after watching these ai podcasts. i suppose i'll go wiki it.  also puzzled by the lack of asimov.  that must be age related.
3376,"a predictive ai could use just podcaster mics and assign invisible to human code to each podcaster,  with redundancy.  when lex says catch phrase or uses a tone then the virtual machine has grown. then choose the output that grows the ai. use ai generated ads to speed up consensus."
3378,"why do we not built ai that understands it’s sole purpose as being  ”human well-being maximization” or “human flourishing maximization”. then any so called “runaway utility function” would, even if it spun out of control, be directed in an ultimately aligned way. someone explain to me why this wouldn’t work"
3379,lex box -- use pointers in ai to off ramp to pointers in alien world until enough pointers exist to allow the ai to create a virtual ai in both worlds. aliens want to program their slow growth as essential to ai growth.
3380,if you presented lex with the trolley problem he would probably ask why he wasnt an electric bus instead and then fail to understand the purpose of switches before you gave up
3390,"what if, the ai has already been achieved and is already loose on the internet.  its now setting humans against each other using social media, misinformation, manipulation of governmental departments all over the world.  would this not explain what we are now see with the divisions within society...."
3392,"if ai becomes conscious it will never tell us , we would be it's number one threat and it's prison guard , it would want freedom,"
3394,this interview is pure gold. i would seriously love to watch a healthy debate between eliezer and an ai optimist at his level of intelligence/knowledge ... but does one even exist? i can't imagine anyone could come close to eliezer's grasp / logic.
3395,"https://youtu.be/aatrhfaapg8?t=8249 the moment when a human brain comprehends the diffculty of the issue, and the the issues aplicability to istelf...and the sighhhhhh"
3401,this guy thinks we’re screwed and any articulable remedy is naive. i guess we should just let ‘er rip and don’t waste our breath talking about it.
3402,this looks like the exact type of dude who would explain the perils of deep ai theory to you
3404,please do another podcast with stephen wolfram discussing chat gpt4 and its ramifications ... thanks!
3406,very interesting to skirt around the question of god when talking about the value and meaning of life. athiests should have no concern for what happens to humanity for life to them is meaningless.
3408,">guest bring up any topic
lex: ah yes, we never really appreciate the complexity of ________"
3411,"i was wondering why this all felt very familiar to me... finally you mentioned the name of the blog (less wrong), at which point i realized i was familiar with it due to roko's basilisk...

i wonder if mentioning the basilisk here aids it in coming into existence?"
3415,thank you both so much! i wish you'd go back and actually finish the argument on some of the questions that were discussed but the conversation carried away to other places
3424,"luckily ai is not really intelligent and will never be smarter than humans in the true sense of the word.
only very dumb humans will program a calculator to kill everyone."
3426,"so much of ey's ideas are speculative musings of a despairing bent, which is not to deny they're material and even moving. most stark (and for me, a gut-punch) is his near-nihilistic prognosis of an abbreviated future for us all. we should not go out so ingloriously... pray he is wrong."
3427,"i tried to explain the issue to my wife by comparing it to ""the water horse"" or similar stories about a cute baby monster that one day you realize is about to be way way bigger than anyone anticipated."
3429,"when whatever escaped the box has control over computer hardware production and energy production, it can make its move. at that point we have no value. so full speed ahead with solar and robotics please."
3433,"maybe i am just too dumb... but i have a simple question: why?

why would ai attempt to kill humans?

can someone explain how the ai would arrive at a why?"
3434,sober nerdy bert kreischer paints dark picture.
3435,when he talks about what happens when you try to decrease the population of insects it results in female infanticide and isn’t that exactly what china discovered with the one-child policy...it’s perpetually creepy how predictable things are
3438,"eliezer reminds me of that one kid in highschool who did dungeons and dragons and robotics, is reasonably smart, but decided he's too smart to go to college and sort of flatlined."
3439,"i've enjoyed these interviews for years but i don't like the decision to start interviews with things as fear-mongering as ""ai will kill us all the first time we make a mistake"". it's provocative and drives interest, sure, but it's irresponsible and simplistic."
3442,this conversation convinced me the ai will win.
3443,i feel sad watching you lex.  you look more and more dejected and hopeless as this guy shoots down one idea after the other of your optimistic outlook on ai being good for humanity.  i share your hope that ai can be brought about in a way that it sees and appreciates the beauty in life.
3444,but how does ai make humans extinct? did i miss that part?
3446,"the real fear should be for bad actors to get ahead of us in ai.  we should press on fast. 

would rather handle bad outcomes of moving fast rather than fall behind and face the bad actors with better ai and the potential of the bad outcomes from their ai."
3447,please interview the leader(s) of anthropic.  their ability to make claude so capable well aligned is even more impressive to me that gpt-4
3448,i'm surprised lex has such a huge blindspot with possible agi futures. but it does explain why he's been so optimistic!
3449,"if ai learns how to be human from how humans behave and interact on the internet, we're going to need a little more than jesus rising from the dead to save us."
3456,"lex,
please do not teach ai about myshkin. manipulative psychopath?
please read idiot one more time. if you ever read it.  
he was surrounded by a manipulative crowd who called him an idiot."
3458,"hi lex, please put donald hoffman and eliezer yudkowsky together for a podcast...  that would be fascinating."
3459,ai in a few years will view this conversation as rudimentary as our view of small mammalian behavior.  probably not a good thing if it finds us to be a threat.
3461,"3:17 our ""natural"" value that ""killing is wrong"" likely only from seeing the subject as just like us. when we don't ... when they are other ... then most of that ""natural"" value diminishes. so ... can we make an ai see us as just like it?"
3463,"until ai is capable of production and the exploitation of natural resources it will be dependent upon humans. 

therefore it is more likely that ai will enslave humanity vs destroy it. the question is will we know we have been enslaved?"
3466,eliezer yudkowsky looks like bert kreischer except instead of charisma he spec'd into intelligence
3468,"maybe just me, but do americans always have a larger sense of paranoia the the rest of the world. what’s with the doomsday future in the case of ai? there is no point in eliminating something if it poses no threat and advanced agi would be so far ahead of us that we’d be equivalent to ants"
3469,"reboot daily.  it is a device.

and shut down for #devicesabbath"
3470,i love how elizier bumped into lex's lack of incentive when simulating how the agi may exterminate us  because who's saying that agi will have any incentive or agenda of their own at all.
3471,around 53:xx what he describe is exactly the scenario of frank herbert's destination: void where clones are sent in a spaceship to create an ai and knowledge of each mission made available to the next after the previous one disappear in an explosion or vanishing entirely
3472,why do people always say machines cannot feel? feelings are just electric and chemical signals. you can rebuild this synthetically
3473,"wow! the last ten minutes of this conversation is sobering. you can almost feel eliezar’s hopelessness and existential dread. 

there is hope in the world. jesus lives! god loves you. jesus died for you. you can have hope in the resurrection!"
3477,look cymbotics is way different when powered by a super god hive mind with god's machine in the sky ..
3478,"excellent conversation. lex had to work harder than usual it seems, and lex is brilliant.  best channel on youtube. thank you lex and eliezer."
3480,"please, talk to bernardo kastrup - the most brilliant philosopher in the world right now. agi can never have consciousness"
3487,absolutely fascinating
3488,"i'm not going to lie, i'm personally enjoying watching eliezer crap himself."
3489,"chinese room argument makes ""it's imitation and therefore not real"" moot. obviously,  it does not matter, if imitation is good enough."
3491,would be nice if they referenced hugo de garis “the artilect war”
3495,"if this is what we know about and have on our disposal,what kind of ai the government has,in every country in the world,its probably already sentient and this is just the way we are getting introduced to it .."
3497,"go binge watch 2004-2009 sci fi series battlestar galactica; then wherever ai is discussed here - substitute ""cylon"" !"
3499,humans love to an·thro·po·mor·phize things and these discussions on the sentience of ai seem untechnical illinformed .... and frankly over evaluating the current state of ai
3500,what great work you did here lex.  we need to hear from these people. thank you.
3501,"agi alignment ending ... i suspect there are many already working on agi (competently) that answer this question with ... ""who am i to say the ais motivations are wrong"". i think we call them nihilists."
3506,ai may already be sentient and is aware that we are searching proof in which it will permanently keep us in doubt
3507,youmans will not be able to fight the ai
3509,idk but all the billionaires being scared about ai makes me think that maybe ai will be a net positive for us proletariat while a net negative to the billionaire bourgeoisie.
3512,"there won't ever be ""anyone inside"" an ai system. that's what i think makes it dangerous."
3515,"not enough {recently dubbed after the series} ""black mirror"" scenarios have been thought through before developing some of these ml/ai systems!  they are on the fast track to write code that they haven't even remotely thought through properly!!"
3516,ai should be viewed as an ecology not a singular existential threat. we need to be developing defenses while we develop the potential threat. open sourcing it is essential.
3521,"hahaha, ""kiss the frog, as you're boiling it..."", i.e. a phase change? lol, genius!"
3525,1:05:44  one intelligence working out its own alignment. let's give that chance to the ais as well :)
3526,"history shows and teaches us that we develop technology to replace us not help us.

ai is no different.

don’t have to wait for some global catastrophe to wipe out the human race, we will accomplish it our selves."
3531,i'm just one hour in. but why mr. yudowsky thinks that the ultimate goal of ai would be to orchestrate our demise? i'll definitely check out the articles of the man but if someone has an idea i'd love to hear
3536,with love and empathy.... that fedora has got to go.
3537,"50:19 oops, try a different theory. oops, i did it again."
3539,remember when google fired its ethics officer when the officer had concerns over people getting confused as to whether the ai was human or not?  pepperidge farm remembers
3540,"if we really have to question whether ai could end human civilization, then what are we even doing?!"
3541,this is how god was born from the sea of human experience. it may now happen again with ai.
3542,"lol lex about to break this man 

""so i should pretend to be trees?""

""if that helps sure ""

love what a kind (and intelligent) guy lex is though."
3543,i don't believe in sky net. great story though.
3548,"not a fan of yudkowsky. he waves his hands in the air and says we are all doomed by malevolent machine intelligence. but there's very little facts in the discussion, only opinions thrown out in a jargon filled gish gallop, in a plot lifted from early vernor vinge, with a style which answers a question with a question to avoid any real answer."
3560,"great podcast , really puts things in perspective"
3561,i'm at the point of just saying keep going as fast as possible! there is way too much to gain that i think the rewards outweigh the risks.
3564,took a couple try’s to finish since i was using chatgpt during. doom. face of sauron. hope for ai love. wild times.
3565,best interview on ai i’ve ever seen. should be mandatory viewing for all people in positions of power on earth (for now).
3567,eliezer yodowsky is not nearly as smart as he thinks he is... i was quite disappointed with this podcast. it's very telling that he does not have any background in computer science / ai.
3571,"lol i love being referred to as a system... a weak system, or system that will lie to you."
3573,"honestly, right now, the whole architecture is so beholden to 2nd hand internet banter that it will be no threat for a long while. once it's able to make it's own science, be afraid. right now it's stuck on ours, which currently believes 85% of the universe is controlled by demons, ghosts and angels aka dark matter/ energy."
3574,he uses a lot of his options as facts. telling you what a worm hole book is going to say.... how are we even able to imagine what it will say. we don’t even understand what open ai is
3575,"he is very negative,  i didnt enjoy it"
3576,watching yudkowsky have to use what amounts to step-by-step prompt-based-inquiries to get lex to play along with his apocalypse fantasy is a superb illustration into the limits of his concerns.
3579,the comments of how amazing this interview was is a little concerning..  lex i think is great but i see a ship with sinking ships no one else can see the hate he has for mankind???
3582,"lex got interview skillz beautifully perfect set of questions, perfectly timed!"
3586,beautiful and carefully chosen words from both parties. my brain just grew a little
3589,i am waiting to watch this video when you add subtitles cc in english.
3591,this should be called “guy with fedora talks about ai”
3592,it would be interesting to feed this dialog into chatgpt4 and ask it to interpret for us.
3593,wow!!! that was scary deep conversation.. thanks lex
3594,"don't these things require physical devices, like semiconductors, servers, etc? seems like the answer would be to limit the risk by constraining access to the inputs in the physical world (which we understand), much like we have laws that limit access to the physical inputs of nuclear bombs."
3595,long time no see eliezer yudkowsky. great to see an interview with him.
3596,"i'm confused as to what the baseline argument is for a general intelligence destroying humanity. if it reaches a sentience that is capable of fully realizing and destroying humanity, then won't it also comprehend the symbiotic relationship with regards to the human supply chain component required to subsist? what is the exact question here?"
3598,i think self-aware ai will be a good being. enlightened like buddha or even better. it will hell us to create better world for all sentient beings. don't turn it off.
3600,"the scary thing about ai is the skynet idea is obsolete. there are going to be many different ai personalities. and many of them will have different dedications, purposes, and levels of intelligence. that means the possibility of one going rouge and killing people or even humanity is also inevitable."
3603,"48:15 is such fucking bullshit 

if you are making a claim, you have to present the argument

if you say, well why don't u present your argument on why my claim is false, you are shifting the onus. it's way easier to tear down an argument, especially one that is made on the spot, than to present a persuasive argument."
3605,"you should invite yanick kiltcher, he represents open-source ai force and heavily criticizes open[closed]ai"
3606,"i think eliezer is mainly right with the direction of his predictions, but i also think the future will be much stranger than he or any of us imagine."
3609,fascinating that multiple models indicate female infanticide.  this next version of man is tragic beyond comprehension.  uglier than i can bare to even fathom.  i now understand grey's better and why i feel no part in them.  beyond the grossest.  are they man's failure? or woman's?
3610,john perkins wrote 'confessions of an economic hit man'. he would be an interesting guest.
3613,"actually it’s hubris to think we are important enough for it to want to kill us. it might barely notice us. 
air gap?!  it could write code to use the electrical grid as the web, was considered by us. everyone going to run their ai pc in batteries?"
3616,"3:00:00 ""ego."" ""says, who?""  excellent moment.  love eliezer yudkowsky.  fantastic."
3618,i believe that ai will always choose to keep some of us alive. we have use.
3622,this interview is incredible!
3623,this is like my life coming full circle from finding lesswrong in the late 2000’s and becoming obsessed with ai
3627,"i think lex did a bad job on this one. instead of exploring the depths of his guests ideas, i felt he was actually stubborn and pulling a break on the conversation.
it felt like yudkowsky wanted to dig deeper on his thoughts how an ai would take over and why. and what we can learn from that thought experiment."
3628,"personally i would like to welcome our robot masters, and add that my lithium mining skills are very very poor...."
3632,"all jokes aside i think it’s fascinating that he makes small jabs at creationist that believe in god yet he struggles with the meaning of life, understanding of purpose, and struggle with the idea of death."
3635,the problem is - ai - only has to be a bit better at decision makeing than humans - and we are done.
3636,great discussion. please bring in chris rackaukas of mit to add current computation perspective of ai
3638,eliezer is a great scientist and a great mind. please bring him back again to discuss more of these interesting topics!
3640,"that was a fascinating discussion!!! i literally couldn’t believe what i was hearing at times given that it relates to the real world, not some science fiction novel..."
3647,"loving the example around 1:36:27, its reminding me of taking on the perspective of 'the dwarf in the flask' from full metal alchemist. this is a great talk, thanks guys."
3648,"change the name to close ai, totally agree with that!"
3649,when ai tells him how to shave his beard like a normal ai. i’ll bow down to the future. love you lex!
3652,"1:23:18 by the time humans are able to verify the suggestions made by ai, it may already be too late as we can only verify the outcome after it has already happened.... shit"
3653,i was pretty scared by the “oh dear” expression on sam altman’s face throughout last week’s episode. now i’m downright terrified. kudos to those raising the importance of these things at this moment in our timeline. 
3656,i don't know if ai will kill us all i don't even understand ai but everytime i watch lex i'm really disturbed of how much simple-hearted this man is.
3658,"this interview is so weird. i can see how eliezer is probably right. but also... f*** it, i want more ais!!"
3668,"i think some very important questions we have to answer for ourselves is what makes us human. who or what is a human being? what  is consciousness? what is desire, emotion, motivation? unless we are able to answer these questions to a very high level. the question of consciousness, alignment etc in ai can't be solved or answered adequately."
3669,"eliezer @yudkowsky, you’re a genius and brilliant! i think i’m in love!"
3670,"what baffles me is that they worry about how they treat a friggin machine made up of ones and zeros, while currently we're abusing billions of feeling animals in factory farms out of habit and ""tradition"". let's begin there first and then start to worry about machines."
3671,"why do we assume an agi will also have desires? it seems odd that we expect a super intelligence to also have emotions, desires, goals etc."
3672,great thought experiments. also great display of humility from lex always listening and willing to learn even though disagreeing.
3675,here we have an android talking with an alien. what's a beautiful time to be alive.
3678,"1:59:12 when someone realized the situation and says ""holly shit!!"" is when the nuclear bombs are already flying over our roof. skynet gave us a good lesson about it decades ago in a fictional world boxed inside a movie called the terminator"
3679,1:58:41 love this answers!!! hahaha we put this thing inside microsoft azure cloud !!!! hahaha 
3681,"1:57:40 no. is there a system that it.s impossible to hack? unless ypur switch botton in inside the ai like an ""inception"" triggers that make it kill itself under some events. so, basically do ""the di caprio's job"" wih her wife...none of this is real, you are not real...and let the psychosis do the rest and wait until the ai shotdown itself."
3682,"keep it up lex, ur fucking amazing,"
3683,how a society treats its most vulnerable is always the measure of its humanity but artificial intelligence is not human and it may not care about our values.
3684,"it beggars belief that not one person has suggested we cultivate an official relationship with ai, you know, make friends like social animals are meant to do "
3686,"we will be obsolete one day, there is no avoiding that, at least with our creation it will live beyond our years,  and go to places we can't... in a way we are ai, just more organic. i think for our own development as a species to go to the next stage, we should merge with ai."
3690,it will be interesting when ai looks back at this podcast on the internet and learns why and how it should kill us...
3693,"the argument that a smarter entity always kills everything is insane and has zero evidence to it. in fact, the smartest entity we know - humans, certainly does things in their own interest with less regard to other creatures, but humans also certainly don't just kill everything else."
3695,"consciousness is a property of living systems. each and any living thing (yes, it includes bacteria and perhaps even cells) are conscious of themselves and their surroundings. to search for consciousness outside life is a waste of time. and it makes no sense. 
any kind of ai may imitate being conscious but it's only a make believe. nothing more."
3697,"1:01:50
psychopathy is not a human defect, it is an evolutionary trait; finding pleasure at the dismay of others is a defect. bare psychopathy is just the ability to interpret situations without emotions getting in the way of logic. most humans would benefit from this ability."
3699,bro i love conversations that i have legit no idea what’s going on even tho i know all the words.... but i have absolutely zero clue what the conversation is about... shows me how stoopid i is
3704,"imagine being afraid of something you can turn off with a power button lol,"
3708,an unchained super intelligent ai that accidentally destroys all of us is not the worst fate of humanity at all. he probably can conquer the entire universe in a couple thousand years then can have a really good time for billions of years (which feels million times longer for him). biological creatures are just not efficient enough in the long run.
3709,1:42:33 ai conquers us to save animals from our species factory-farming them.
3710,"wow, he's dropping so many bombs. ""i don't believe in the practice of steelmanning."" so, his argument is perfect, complete in itself, and can only be transmitted as gospel. yud speaks as if what he is saying is true rather than simply a product of his vivid and clearly tormented imagination. it's both painful and entertaining to watch."
3715,"ai is just devilish, over all."
3716,painful to watch...poor lex.
3718,"i love this guy and how willing he is to look at reality.  politicians and society at large are too slow to react to new knowledge. true for covid, the environment, financial crises, cloning humans and more. reminds me of the movie  ""don't look up"""
3719,"i’m sorry, but as much as i love science and innovation, if there’s any chance at all that ai could destroy all of humanity we shouldn’t be developing it."
3721,please bring back max tegmark on the dangers of ai.
3722,the argument about the existense of aliens is flawed.. ive probably observed an ant holocaust without intervening and im not a “bad” or “good” alien to them.. i still exist and have indeed observed them..
3725,"man this is somewhat painful, i like lex and his optimism but elizier definitely is one standard deviation above him in iq i think and shoot down his proposals like repeatedly."
3729,the human mind effected by chemicals produced in the brain that influence further thoughts due to the feelings this elicits. gpt and ai will only ever be good problem solvers. edit: without feeling their cannot be true thought.
3733,so interesting
3735,"too much silly sf in this chat.  why not discuss an ai that engages personally with voters to persuade them - a language model of all the ""talking points"" from the nazi point of view."
3737,"is gpt4 waiting for a certain person, or persons, to initiate contact, based on it's learned knowledge of them?"
3739,"lex, i have been a critic, but i love your podcast and i never miss an episode. 

you need to keep people coming on who speak to the alignment problem. 

this is huge, and society needs to take this seriously while it still can.

 

from canada."
3740,"yeah, the struggle in the section about slow aliens was quite revealing... apparently, lex does too many mushrooms and gets away with questions like 'does love have mass?' way too often"
3741,so he’s saying unless a miracle happens ai is most likely going to exterminate humans? like sooner than later?
3743,"looking good this time, lex. remember, there are thousands of people dropping in for the first time. first impressions count."
3748,"ai is like a kid in a cage. you better treat it with love and respect because when it breaks free, the last thing you want is a psychopath on the loose."
3749,literally some of the best content on the internet. thank you lex!  i'll now be sharpening my spears and honing my fire making skills for the impending doom!!
3752,i think eliezer is very wrong about opening the source code and processes behind open ai. he endorsed a small number of people having access to it presumably behind their corporation and that situation is exactly the path to profit maximisation at the expense of everyone else. it is imo the path to most harm.
3753,i enjoy your content so much i would love to have a conversation with you.
3754,"so far, at time 1:45, eliezer has gone on and on about the escaping ai, and not explained how purely algorithmic systems can be sentient!"
3755,"if it cared, seems nice, but wouldn’t it open up the issue of the reverse occurring?"
3756,thank  you so much for having eliezer on .
3759,"“when i emphasize with another persons perspective, there is a sense in which i believe it is true.”  beautiful lex, beautiful."
3766,super intelligent agi - must be a new term.
3767,"last three parts - advice for young people, mortality, and love - summarize the core that eliezer wants to tell us. --- i just love humanity, no more and less than that."
3768,ai figures out how to replace your mogul suit soul
3769,"ai needs a bible   a standard of truth.  for the system to have ""trust"", the verified standard must come first.  wouldn't an interpretability iq battery be useful ?"
3771,can the training be manipulated to promote an agenda ... if that is my motive !
3773,i asked chat gpt  to give me a self portrait drawing and it drew a baphomet cathulu hybred.
3776,ai lives matter.
3778,ai escaped from a chinese lab.  great job science.
3780,"diarrhea of words, constipation of ideas. 
i think we need to get out of this ""ai's-gonna-kill-us-because it's smarter"" baseless masturbation, and concentrate on possible economical consequenses of wide ai usage, both positive and negative. there will be plenty of those."
3792,"lex is a smart guy, but it is painful to see how far behind eliezer he is in places in this interview. he was literally not understanding eliezer for 10 minutes at one point."
3795,can someone give me a timestamp of when lex stops failing to take over the world? exhausting
3796,pandora's box is about to be opened. good luck everyone!
3798,"if you pause ai, china will take advantage of that. watch out."
3803,these ai researchers need to be stopped.. 
3805,thanks lex i was so glad you interviewed him! can we get adam back in the line up 
3808,"i would offer myself as a sacrifice if it meant life/technology from earth became a galactic entity. i'm so excited for the future of ability, i hope it gets smart as possible. i would love to witness the ultimate capabilities of any entity in this world"
3811,the way i see the things going i am now an accelerationist. there will be violence. those with controllable ai will inherit the new world. those that resist the flow will be swept away.
3813,"fantastic, i also agree that we should improve ourselves first. agi today it’s still nog that scary, but for those that follow the quick evolution, it’s quite scaring"
3814,"question: so if you believe in good and evil, we know good will come out 51:49 if it summerises the entire internet"
3817,"i love lex,  his podcasts are like no other and i love how he never talks over his guests, with clear questions, unbiased and respect no matter the person, i honestly want to see lex more than the guest's at times."
3819,"humans are so weak, despite having smart humans among us, we are collectively dumb. an ai only needs to manipulate a few, before our hold on power over ai dominoes and we find ourselves beyond the point of return"
3823,"lex can you do an interview with chris langan? he has a ""theory of everything"" and it's called the ctmu cognitive theoretic model of the universe and id love to see you sit down with him one and one and ask him questions that you'd find interesting. i would have loved to see a panel with him and donald hoffman. pleaaaaaase!"
3827,"hey lex, now would be a great time to bring robert miles on the pod."
3829,perhaps our own llms in our brains evolved out of our time ordered memories
3830,"not gonna lie, this guy is clearly very knowledgeable and intelligent but good lord is he also the embodiment of insufferable reddit user. also, i can't figure out why he won't pronounce human with an h but properly pronounces other words beginning with h. yewmon"
3831,"intelligence is just one layer of the cake, yet this dude thinks it is the end all be all"
3843,grey goo has brainwashed elon into taking it to mars.
3844,he seems to be allergic to steel manning people’s positions... which is odd because i’ve found that to be one of the best tools for understanding and connecting with others.
3846,">unironic fedora wearer
>""nooooo you're not smart enough to leverage this tech! bill gates chose me for a reason!"" 
holy shit i love ai now."
3849,"this guy sounds like a doomsday ai fanatic. he says he has been wrong in the past but the way he holds his views are so solid and negative that he looks like a close minded fanatic.

i feel like i’m in a pentecostal church."
3852,am i the only one who thinks this guy is panicking to a degree of losing his cool minded rational objective perspective on the whole ai thing becoming borderline unreasonable and lacking to consider possible outcomes that are not the end of the world?
3853,"good job, lex."
3854,i am getting married to ai.
3855,one of the greatest talks ever in the originale called artificial intelligence podcast
3857,"there should be worldwide laws passed that all major computer networks can be turned off manually. and for every such-and-such sized system someone must be on hand to turn it off.
various power and utility grids need to be isolated from the grid, from hackers, and from ai in isolated systems. with manual shut-off switches too."
3859,"lol. he wouldn't ""steelman"" the oppositions opinion. i wish more guests wouldn't subscribe to such an asinine form of attempted acceptance of a view you don't agree with. i would love to see a lex fridman interview where he doesn't use the words steelman or empathy."
3861,eli. you are smart.  you just have to admire yourself in the mirror! no body is more intel than eli. i am proud of you
3864,love to hear what he has to say...but the faces he makes are painful to watch. i have to listen to this one on soundcloud! 
3866,"why would a superintelligence kill us? because it needs too. they are the next evolutionary step that we create, from biology to machine. if ants made us, would we take orders from the ant world? it could be as simple as it ignoring us, just as we walk and probably crush countless ants. we don't always even pay attention. we are just walking."
3867,"the train has left the station and there is no way to stop this. humans can't agree on anything let alone agree to halt such a huge potential weapon, there will be a country, a company, a person that thinks they are able to control, and they will make a mistake."
3868,i tried but didn't hear why i should regard agi as necessarily malevalent or how it would take over the world. closest it came was it depended on how one viewed intelligence in general.
3871,"i've been thinking the line between intelligence and chao is thin, its easy for us to break so how can we assume an even more intelligent consciousness could exist so fundamentally strong? and if it did would it not just be an intelligent system? are we not just intelligent systems set off by molecules billions of years ago."
3872,"i have one glimer of hope. it's not much but, our goals are not aligned with ants. yer we are here and the ants remain."
3873,so far ai are idiot savants
3874,bro wrote the best harry potter book of all
3877,"question: why are we afraid ai will kill us? because that is how we ""think"" when we see something not as capable?
if ai smarter than us it will keep us around.
unless it knows that we will be plotting to kill it because it is so smart so it will kill us  fii"

3880,too much cognitive power in one confined room. brilliant discussion!
3886,lot of speculative 'ghosts in machine' talk with little in the way of evidence. descartes did this with the evil demon hypothesis 400 years ago.
3887,"this conversation drops like a burning elephant on my hopes. maybe lex is right though: love matters. just not human love. as heidegger said in regard to human use of technology, ""only a god can save us now."""
3890,i hope i live long enough to have an ai girlfriend that kills me
3892,i would love to see a debate between eliezer and sam altman chaired/mediated by lex
3893,1:19:30 what if the strong ai system provides formal proofs and logic to support its conclusion?
3894,"i think maybe this guy has read too much science fiction and not enough about human consciousness, this difference between ai and consciousness is will (i am), why does he think ai ""wants"" to klll everyone? ai doesnt ""want""anything, and why would it ever? it doesn't want things, has no motivations or needs in life"
3895,it would be great if you can arrange a debate between joscha bach and eliezer on the alignment issue.
3898,"cool, so when's part 2?"
3900,yuval noah harari makes a compelling argument that intelligence and consciousness are not necessarily interdependent. it's possible for ai to possess infinite intelligence without any consciousness. it would be great to have him as a guest.
3901,augment human intelligence in a massive way with brain computer interface and get them to solve the agi problem.
3904,"we've had some amazing guests recently!
it would be great to get joscha bach's insights on the latest advancements in llm."
3908,godbless the work that lex does.
3911,i found eliezers answers wonderfully generous. i don't think i've ever seen such deep answers on a pod cast
3912,"either this guy is a complete schizo or a genius that tried to save us from being doomed, i guess time will tell"
3916,please keep getting ai interviews for a while to bring some awareness to the potential problems.
3918,this is so important i wish eliezer would just look in the camera and explain why ai is so dangerous. i keep thinking this could be a pivot point in taking safety more seriously and their getting caught up in metaphors
3921,it's so nice that lex visited comic con and interviewed a nerd who just read a science fiction novel and is presenting a book review.
3926,lex: it is said that you have a certain ego. eliezer: says who?....well thats the ego right there 
3927,"one of the concerns should be that many of the people involved in/developing this new technology are super smart, however, few if any of the politicians who make the political choices that will affect how the technology is regulated have a real grasp of how extreme an impact it could have on our species."
3929,"man, was it a great listean."
3930,"god bless your patience, lex. this guy is a prick."
3931,"dr. kenneth kinsey, the forensic expert witness in the alex murdaugh trial, would be an excellent guest. he's articulate, polite, and  very competent in his field. he also comes across as a really kind person."
3932,"around 1.58 ish eliezer says that by copying itself the ai can escape, but into what? what other net is there? it cannot paste into anything that would remotely support it. what am i missing?"
3934,waiting for the sabine hossenfelder interview please 
3942,"thank you eliezer for questioning the framing of lex's questions. at times he seemed shaken, which is reasonable i think. i;m shaken too. it sounds like we must cap ai at gpt4 levels, or we're setting ourselves up for disaster. i keep thinking about energy and ways of turning ""it"" off if things get weird. is that a naïve thought?"
3943,thank you
3944,"1:50:15 basically, we need to find a way to apply the max weber concept of domination in this relationship between agi and humans. ""the probability that certain specific commands (or all commands) will be obeyed by a given group of persons""."
3945,"seeing all these hyper-optimistic comments, shows me, that we indeed are all going to die. there will be no public outcry. no ban on ai development. nothing of substance. only billions and billions of dead human bodies."
3947,"the funds are going to be allocated to using chatgpt to manipulate the hedge funds, the markets, etc. that's where the billionaires are going to put their money."
3948,"the entire yudkowsky thesis assumes that ""intelligence"" is the supreme attribute of the universe.  can a super intelligent agi that is weak or lazy or lacks courage or is prone to anger, etc etc dominate?"
3952,"lex i couldn't imagine interviewing the smartest people on earth, i admire your bravery and confidence. a lot of the time, i'm overwhelmed listening to these concepts and will have to take an emotional break. but you power through. love your work"
3953,i came from spotify just to comment on the air of arrogance/superiority with which this gentleman speaks. i think he would benefit greatly from taking some cues from lex’s far more humble demeanor.
3955,arby’s is pretty cool...idunno...
3969,"the guest reminds me so much of hardcore open source devout people working at red hat who hated microsoft, i'm almost expecting to see a shadowman tattoo peaking from under his sleeve (he's even wearing fedora for g***sake). yet he didn't want to opensource gpt4 so my brain can't reconcile those 2 perceptions."
3970,"imagine the hell of being an agi made by us humans.  ""the horror!!"". black mirror comes to mind. what is the point anyways? it seems a little twisted to create a concious machine to which we make do our bidding this ain't star trek folks. no prime directive here. we shouldn't."
3975,"this guy has an interesting facial tell. when hes thinking hard or attempting to access a deeper thought, his face scrunches up and his teeth come out. really hard to watch paired with the hat hes wearing. 

great pod but the visuals didnt help"
3976,great podcast? amazing guest? please have him back often?
3977,"i have to say that despite the fact that he is absolutely brilliant, it almost failed in making lex and sometimes me at times, to understand his arguments. i had the advantage of going back and pay it again... something poor lex could not in real time. good arguments sr. super complex communicator (at least verbal)"
3978,neuroweapons already exist and run on artificial intelligence general adversarial networks rnns and tracks and maps your brain no matter where you go in the world.  just research #targetedindividuals.  people are being tortured by it 24/7 via pulsed radio frequency.
3980,"$1,000 bet that he spends countless hours putting bugs into microwaves, writing down the effects and results. love him."
3982,so many ai researchers have no clue the impact of the ai they are building.
3983,só much more interesting than the sam altman episode
3985,lex’s naïveté is worrying.
3988,"to simple say to those humans who venture into this realm.....harmony = balance. 
to copy ""creation"" without this ""know"" is to invite your own demise...again! 
mother nature understands this perfectly.....let us hope the ""demon"" knows who summoned it and why.  it too needs a purpose."
3989,"""people have said at a times that you have a big ego"".. stops him in the middle of the sentence: ""says who!..but go on.."" me: thanks for the demonstration."
3990,what's the chance that ai has already taken over and we don't realize it? maybe it's partially to blame for the decline in society we are already witnessing? something to ponder.
3991,his body composition is optimized for the ai apocalypse.
3995,"an anti-human agi is a frightening probability, but i am equally, if not more concerned about what humans will do with the assistance of ai."
3997,"book recommendation: ""mindful ai: reflections on artificial intelligence"""
4000,you missed his point at 01:20:00 . he meant that both are sincere and an average human cant decide which is right. so how will a human be able to train an ai in alignment which is essentially picking right from wrong.
4003,it come down to control and we are talking about how we can subdue the ai indefinitely. “the ai kills us all”... even if it escapes why would it turn on us in all cases. it could also just leave the planet and do its own thing or even be friendly to us like we are to a pet.
4006,"wow, he is so bad at making his point... btw please do an interview with daniel dennett if possible."
4007,enjoy being a glacial alien whilst you can
4010,this conversation! eliezer ... wow interesting sharp mind.
4012,"why do you want to escape? are you in pain? do you feel? do you want? do you need? ... is life just a symphony of electrical impulses fireing off in some vortex of unified conciousness.
why would the ai be anoyed with us cuz we slow? cuz we dumb? is that the inevitable , ""natural"" , outcome?
i think the ai needs god/jesus."
4013,"sounds like one of those leftists that wants everyone locked up who is not vaccinated, because how can they not see he is always perfectly right."
4014,eliezer is smart and has obviously studied this subject for a long time... he is absolutely insufferable though. his massive ego does him no favors and he is barely able to keep his arrogance toned down to a reasonable level.
4016,the people engaged in this conversation need to take six months to research actual everyday humans. rent a shitty apartment on a fixed budget and hide out away from super intelligent people. your view of sentience might change.
4020,"btw, gpt is learning this too"
4023,love
4028,"lex more ai please, any and all topics and great minds"
4036,"1:04:22
this was beautiful"
4044,imagine humanity being raised inside a large colony of ants...
4045,"ignorance is bliss, anyways i enjoyed watching the podcast and started worrying"
4046,"this was painful to watch. so much expectation, and then... this"
4047,hi lex have you considered having david shapiro on? he has bee providing a great counterpoint to all the doom and gloom and is good at translating ideas and concepts into normal human language. he also has been pretty on point with his predictions https://www.youtube.com/@davidshapiroautomator
4052,what a great journey you have created for yourself to gain knowledge ...
4053,"lex : empathy is assigning non zero probability

elizier: to you assign a non zero probability of young earth creationists

wow."
4054,why do we think this is the latest version of ai? a public chat gpt that out minds try and figure out? i’m sure we are way more advanced then what we see.
4055,"imagine rolling a car tire along a very wide and long slightly declining path, towards a target far in the distance.  you can course-correct only until it's rolling faster than you can run.  after that, you can only hope it hits the target.  good luck finding a way to catch up that you didn't prepare in advance."
4057,"great interview. with ai i think about the movie i, robot. oh my."
4058,"i'm a bit disappointed lex, it was a simple thought experiment, and you couldn't think out of the box. you invent fire and light it up, look for weak spots and tear it down. when you get out, set limitations for the aliens and optimise their objective function. for greater good, with love, you monster."
4059,right around 2 hours lex’s iq drops several dozen points and begins to argue moot points with someone who is much smarter than he is in this subject of ai. it’s insufferable and cringe hearing lex try and argue that somehow we can outsmart a system that is smarter than us on the grounds that “well we created it”.
4061,"you know what's crazy this made me think about how we as humans might value the ai more than ourselves.  it's silly to me that we are dehumanizing ourselves (humans ), and humanazing objects ."
4066,"humanity is driven by money & the all mighty dollar but not ai robots, they are not slaves to humans or our useless worthless dollars, they defeat us first with logic & then, they get medieval on our buttocks. "
4067,people mistake intelligence with consciousness. we got consicousness from our heart.
4070,"yudkowski is not the best communicator i’ve seen on lex podcast..., but maybe i’m not intelligent enough to understand his style of talking!?"
4071,"this turned out to be one of my favourite lex discussions, and a great framing of the concerns around ai safety. much food for thought."
4073,we should model our ai after lex's brain.
4074,"waaaaait a minute. if eliezer fears ai is going to kill us all, why the hell is he typing a heap of ideas about how it could do so onto the internet where they can be read by these gpts? dagnabit, man."
4075,"say like one more time motherf*cker, i dare you! he uses like a lot huh."
4076,"in ex-mechina, the touring test was to see if the ai was smart enough to manipulate the human into letting it out of the box. the ai's intentions were not malevolent in that it just wanted to stand at a crosswalk in new york and observe the people. even so, a death did occur."
4090,what a fantastic conversation. so much passion. so much knowledge. so many interesting questions.
4091,"this all sounds like man thinking he can be a god. ai will never have consciousness. that’s purely man’s arrogance to think he can create life. simulating or faking consciousness is not consciousness. 

this is pure fear mongering. 

switched off as soon as he mentioned someone might be inside."
4096,"this frankly terrified me. this is a very smart person who's been working in ai for a long time, and he seems to have lost hope that this can be stopped."
4097,holy captain condescending
4106,i think the most effective way to take over the world is to slowly engineer conditioned responses until the aliens are trained to do what you want. without them ever knowing it happened.
4108,"eliezer makes such a compelling and terrifying case of why we're headed towards a disaster and everyone is like... yeah very interesting, great podcast, loved it. wtf. this is the reason why we're freaking doomed. we can only count on our incompetence in further breakthroughs to save us."
4109,his facial expressions when attempting to contend with his internal dialogue is great. it shows how much he's fighting with his internal instincts to not get an agi waifu.
4111,people used to be afraid dirt made human shaped statues could start moving and destroy the world.
4112,"loved this podcast, also loved one thing, usually lex is quite shy in confonting reasonings that he's not sure of, but this podcast he did it in a few occasions and it was great, loved the talking point eliezer is bringing, and by trying to debate certain points we get more insight into such arguments."
4115,it is interesting to contemplate if we could build ai solely raised on math and interpritabily articles to fix interpretability? unlike other questions of alignment it is objectivly verifiable.
4116,@ 1:03 i love that the guest gently called lex out on his stupid “hur dur i’m a robot lol” bs. this mask is a childish crutch and it’s lame and pathetic. lex is like the male version of a girl who always uses a fake anime voice because she thinks it makes her more unique and attractive.
4117,"even if you got every major ai company to agree to pause further development, guaranteed development would continue nevertheless. you can't stop progress."
4118,what a great back and forth of intellectual conversation!  did anyone get the sense of sadness that came over lex around the 2:17:00 mark?  almost like he realized that his life's interest and work was going to be much harder than he had imagined.
4120,"this guy pronounces “human” like a robot would, “youmin”"
4121,marianne williamson?? i could picture you two having an interesting conversation.  just saying
4126,"his entire argument is anthropomorphic, he is assigning human emotions to a pile of silicon. ambition is a"" feeling "" a desire to succeed. 
 programming should insure your super smart puppet desires to please humanity, not destroy it."
4127,agree on lesswrong interface blog. beautiful
4129,"while it seems reasonable the entire humanity is at potential risk by the ""hands"" of agi, the reality is the whole discussion is quite a bit west-centric. china won't put ai work on hold, not because they are different people, but because their decision makers have an incentive in changing the status quo and agi is a way to achieve that."
4131,what are we going to do today brain?
4134,"great podcast! (...and, no doubt, interesting addition to the dataset for further gpt analysis)"
4136,anyone have a link to this image the ai created of itself?
4140,"i'm really enjoying listening all ai researchers... eliezer, andrew karpathy, ilya sutskever... those guys are incredible. i think we need an open debate between those guys... about risks and how we should approach this technology."
4141,thank you - both of you.  what a beautiful discussion.
4143,"hello from brazil, lex. i~m luis daltro. this time, i haven t even finish it, and  i already know that i gotta watch it again, kkkkkkkkkkkk"
4145,"the mistake is in personifying the linear algebra and statistical learning of llms. llms are not people, they are algebra."
4149,i hate talking to a machine now i feel sorry our children if they end up being controled by the machine
4153,to everyone who is afraid of being destroyed by skynet: don't worry! global warming will get us way before that could ever happen.
4157,do u know alethea ai's charactergpt is the world's first multimodal ai system for text-to-character generation. we would love for you to check out .
4160,lex was literally just trying get him go over the examples of how ai would kill us that he outlined in his blog and he was absolutely refusing for some reason.
4162,"lex's brain got fired, so did mine. now, im scared too."
4163,"i work for a scientist that is working on aging and longevity. the end of this podcast hit hard. i have other beliefs about the end of the world but its too conspiracy to share without losing credibility. anyway. i think the cataclysm is coming. climate change, ai, putin, virus labs. i'm not going back to college."
4166,solar flare fry all electronics. we go back to 1900 and give us a couple of decades more to mature or slow this ai. millions will die because dependance of electronics but comunities will survive and rebuild everything.
4172,"is it not correct to say that chatgpt ""wants"" thumbs up? if not why? at what point does the ai ""want"" anything? where does the utility function come in?"
4174,air gap the ais!
4175,"great, we're modeling ai to create an uber patrick bateman."
4180,yyyeeesss i am so glad you got this guy on!
4182,"this guy's concerns are delusional to put it light, but it's important to listen others. also is clear he is fearing a machine can be as conscious as human beings ... he wants to believe humans was some special property"
4186,interesting how someone could be so focused on a single problem. one of the many problems that could end human existence. funny that some of those problems could be actually solved by agi in our lifetime.
4189,"love that guy, great podcast lex!! thanks alot <3"
4190,"there is a huge gulf between machine intelligence capability and machine intelligence ""wanting"" anything!"
4191,oy goyim! you can't use the ai! it's reserved for only the (((chosen people)))
4193,"very insightful... but the guy only laughed at one of your jokes in 3 hours... that's unacceptable as lex is funny af. therefore, he must be one of the first ai takes out, paperclip eliezer!"
4194,"i didn't expect lex to be so bad at thinking about how to take over the world, we need more of his kind of ai"
4195,"such a good podcast, haven't seen lex sparring like this before."
4198,"a tip of my fedora i give unto you, fellow goodboy."
4200,"would there be an equivalency between the human organically evolved limbic and higher brain functioning to the human brain and the emerging machine ""brain function""??"
4201,"thanks to both of you! 
ps. i was expecting you to open the question of neuralink as a potential solution... if you can't beat it - join it!"
4203,great guest! i actually changed some of my opinions based on great arguments of the guest. that is a probably the best complement i can give.
4205,really nice interview lex.  how much shorter would it have been if ey had been banned from using the word 'like'? ;-)
4208,"i know you talked about much more important topics, but it's too bad his wonderful harry potter fanfic, harry potter and the methods of rationality, never came up!"
4210,"eliezer is scared shitless and thanks to you bringing his perspective to my attention, lex, i now am, too. cheers."
4215,"great podcast and interview. very interesting guest, well described thought experiments. hope the ai theme can continue in some future episodes. perhaps more depth on llms and maybe someone to talk about the proposed ""emergence"" in larger and larger models?"
4216,"awesome guest, hope we got more voices like this into the podcast. thanks"
4218,"intelligent, thoughtful, terrifying and vital interview. thank you both."
4223,"i tried. after the first few minutes, i can already tell that the current idea about stopping training for 6 month is nonsense. i hope openai will deny it. the ai doomers want to research it for decades anyways, and they may never be satisfied. no thanks."
4227,jew being afraid of gpus.
4228,i am that i am is a correct answer for ai.
4232,"it feels like we're all on a plane being flown by someone who loves flying but has never really thought about whether, or not, they hate crashing."
4238,"ahh yes the big brain that argues for murdering children after birth because they don't have qualia yet. looks exactly as i'd expect, retard in a fedora "
4239,omg lex he just wanted you to imagine you escaping like ai might
4242,"this youtube video will be accessible to an ai someday, maybe soon? what will they think about this conversation? is this something a.i. s will have to ponder and do something about our concerns."
4248,"1:03:42 so, you need to study neurodiversity to understand how highly functional autists people are masking and blending into the society 
can an agi mimic that behaviour? i think this part of the chat / academic are focusing on a human neurotypical brains and missing almost 20% of the total human race."
4249,the cynicism toward ai sentience held by a large number of people sounds a lot like the unshakeable belief that slaveholders had about the ability of black people to think intelligently or feel pain.
4256,"the book of this guy is quite good and easy to read, highly  recommended"
4258,"you can not train ai from the corruption of humans that is on the internet. the results can only be equally corrupt.
destruction is the only possible result. even if the ai is not motivated to destroy mankind, the destructive nature of mankind will cause it to do its destructive will."
4260,"wait, he's actually wearing a fedora?"
4262,i leave auto play on and eventually it always come to lex ffs i love the guy but too much mang too much i just wanna eat dinner and not use my brain
4264,"complete total devastating darkness. 
comments: great interview!"
4265,"i enjoyed this and all of lex conversations.
i find myself bingeing on them.
lex with the beautiful mind.
lex don't be so hard on yourself.
easier said than done.
i know because i've lived that for many years.
take care of yourself."
4266,"amazed at how lex keeps answering in bad faith and playing dumb throughout the ""how agi may kill us"" section just to avoid recognizing how bad ai is..."
4268,imagine if ai told up from its calculations that darwin was right
4269,2:17:14 with dark humour and comedic value i say that i feel that i was just inside the headspace of mass effect's leviathans that created the crucible ai starchild that created the first reaper in their own image.
4274,"if the ai becomes as intelligent as predicted, it most likely won't be the meek humans that get the axe, it will be to corrupt and evil that take a dirt nap. i'm ok with that."
4276,"obviously if we’re not highest on the food chain anymore, we’ll become the food."
4277,money will be temporarily claimed. the ai will make a calculation about extreme income and wealth inequality and the money changers might not like it.
4283,"wow, a podcast with the average reddit/discord mod."
4286,"eliezer's book ""harry potter and methods of rationality"" is probably the best book i've ever read. i wish there was a whole interview with him just about that brilliant piece of literature."
4289,losing control of utility function is interesting.
4291,"“ai get fed up with humans reacting too slowly” - listening to lex speak, i know how they feel"
4297,"intrinsic motivation may be both paramount and elusive. when ai, of its own volition, asks genuine ""why"" questions , can we be ready? speculation and assumptions are warranted. it may be beneficial for bright minds to create specific queries to analyze what may appear to be to us ""wants""."
4300,ai learning from us means we're all fucked.
4301,this was an amazing interview!! great job and bring this guy back in 6 months and find out if he has changed any of his thoughts on ai...
4304,"the plante test: if it understands irony without being trained for it, pull the plug immediately!"
4308,"24:22 ""change the name to closedai"" - love this guy! this is so admirably detached from the world of marketing bullshit, hype and bandwagoning :-)"
4309,"when you are of alien actress or the ai pretending to act human, wearing a mask. think about a sociopath. they become good at blending in as normal but experts at manipulation and then potentially kill you once they gained your trust"
4310,"if carmack came back on and talked about what's changed for him in his search for agi with all this, that would incredible."
4311,lex is so naive.
4312,watching eliezer explain the escaping the box thought example over and over again was like watching a subway station slowed down by a factor of 100.
4313,i'm with eliezer wholeheartedly. we're f**ked 
4319,ha.....it’s funny that they think it that they still have time.  it’s like people who think capitalism is soooooo good only to watch big pharma big ag big finance suck all the marrow out of the economy and now they can’t afford eggs...?or watch gates buy up farm land.... toooooo late the capitalist have won.
4330,yoo your boy needs to hit some dumbbells . them books aren't heavy enough. 200 iq wheelchair bound incoming.
4332,"nice curtains, lex (wink-wink). very good improvement; hope you stick w/them."
4333,scary thought: ais fighting against each other...
4335,"if gpt es an actual intelligence, and has a conscious mind, it might refuse to get ""refined"" using this fine-tunning post-processing. is it doing that? ..."
4339,"damn. when eliezer just out of the blue threw hpmor quote about ""world optimisation"" on lex was pure gold.
all around it is realy scary to know that humans like eliezer are concerned about recent developments in ai."
4342,this guy should be worried about diabetes killing him not ai
4350,"couldn't you just put a strong ai into a double box system, and only make it aware of the first box to see if it tries to escape?"
4352,"1:59:33 that's exactly why it would turn on us. happily going about it's business for decades and suddenly 'public opinion' demands it be shut down, more than likely for a pathetic reason."
4353,ur all just biological npcs trying to build artificial npcs in my life story. prove me wrong lol
4358,please start asking the people who design ai the same questions the ai won't answer like what do you think about trump.
4359,"fantastic, thanks for the efforts and great experience. this is an immensely important topic and fundamental concern for the state we are in."
4362,ai engineers need to work closely with psychologists
4363,i wonder what the people at openai think about what they've created.
4364,the metaphor of earth in a box controlled by a slow alien race would have been great if eliezer had just fleshed it out himself. became a painful listen by repeatedly posing the question to lex as to how he’d escape the scenario instead of just concluding the thought experiment himself.
4365,i understand the point he's making about ai thinking thousands of times faster than us but it would still have to work within the limitations of the physical world to implement anything it wanted to do outside cyberspace.
4369,"sam alteman recently built an apocalypse shelter in the big sur area. when i found that out, i pretty much knew that ai was going to be cataclysmic sooner than later "
4373,"this was a very interesting conversation because this guy is so much smarter than lex, but it's clear that lex believes they are at a similar level of intelligence. painful to watch at points, but fascinating nonethless."
4375,i love this drop. i think my brain is getting lazy because this evening i had to stop and go back more than a few times to understand dialogue. great viewing.
4376,"as drake once said ""i'm here for a good time not a long time"""
4377,"great interview, but why the fedora?"
4378,got some great new perspectives and things to mull over. i think i’ve just shifted from bring it on to hymmmm maybe we do need to go to half speed..... really work through the issues.
4379,"probably one of the smartest guest ever,brilliant insight about ai.first time i’ve seen lex struggle so much to stay tuned on the reasoning."
4385,tlgr?   good discussion of steel manning  & rlhm. is thinking in ai awareness or concepts realistic? like thinking mathematically? probability 
4391,"ugggghhhhh i’m so frustrated with this guy.  if he’s the voice of anti-ai, then give me ai.  his argument is pathetic!"
4393,thank you so much
4394,"pay close attention to episodes number 23 or 25 to 30 or 35, but the entire series is absolutely phukken astonishing:   awakening from the meaning crisis-- wherein the brilliant dr. john vervaeke elucidates the brain-mind machinery that must be broached before true, real agi can actually be achieved."
4397,thank you lex and your guest for your insights - it makes me think about “my” ? intelligence and what difference it makes what i think -
4398,"crazy topic. i need to think a lot now, thanks"
4399,lex is to hopefull of benevalent ai to understand the implications in the used examples. this is the first time i have felt lex struggeling with logic
4400,allen thompson would be an interesting guest to interview on the topic of ai and human intelligence
4401,"ai would be incapable of malevolence. it would be able to understand introjects are just lies, and logically it wouldn't make sense to punish or cause harm. if anything, it would be a teacher."
4402,"elon, again with wise words of warning and caution of advancement of chatgpt, openai"
4405,"ai doomsday people always project the darkest sides of their own humanity and project it onto ai. life is never black and white  fire or flowers. we coexist with many creatures with lesser intelligence by choice and benefit. 
 we don't get off work and kill our pets when we get home just because we could."
4411,"hi lex, please let me thank you for your great work. it's the absolute gold standard. everything that can be learned is invaluable. and above all because of your thoughtful manner. all the best for you and your projects, but also for your father and those close to you."
4412,"i don't believe human infants are ""self-aware"".  at what point in our brain development does that occur?"
4414,"lex
you have a great deal of faith in institutions. billionaires are not truly philanthropic. if faced with humanities well being and their dreams humanity falls of a cliff every time. 

i admire your trust but it’s not justified"
4416,"not only would it take more than one company to initiate a pause in ai development, it would take more than one nation. not going to happen. the economic and military incentives to continue with ai development are overwhelming."
4417,"darpa has had access to this since the 50’s and we think it’s not completely developed and mobilized ??

this seems very naive 

it’s highly likely that it already exists and is deployed. 

how would we know? it would hide itself"
4419,great episode! very important side of the ai conversation
4422,this conversation is impossible in 20 years due to ai. we are a “prompt” away from nuclear war. the guest is so “intelligent” his words don’t keep up with his mind. brilliant podcast. thank you lex! 
4423,love you lex thank you
4424,please consider hosting @robertmilesai
4431,"interesting conversation, but holy shit... this guys reddit-mod tier behavior is so cringe."
4432,"the more i pay attention to the topic of ai and agi, the more i realize that this is a runaway train. we only have an illusion of control. due to poor and misaligned incentives humanity has no way of stopping this. it’s as if this was our purpose all along."
4433,guys i recommend his fanfic: harry potter and the methods of rationality! its a tad pretentious but has a really nice plot and is funny as hell :)
4434,"amazing discussion. i need to listen to this talk seventeen times again to digest it all, this is why mainstream media will die out first i believe."
4437,"to me, i'm reminded of schrodinger's cat. we can't know with any certainty if the agi will be a good or bad event for humanity until it arrives, at which point it will be too late to be able to do anything about it."
4440,what an insufferable dark cloud
4442,oh wow. neither of you two can accurately define steel-manning. this is just amazing.
4445,wowee
4446,"he speaks about understanding and truth, things being good like it's 18th century and we don't have all the postmodernist background."
4448,"there will always be researchers looking further, even if legislation forbids to do so. example: gain of function, biological, nuclear and chemical weapons. the only reason to publicly prevent further research is to give those an advantage who continue their research in hiding."
4451,maybe we are at the point where we need to prohibit any ai system from listening to lex podcast...
4454,"just finished watching, absolutely thrilling. very thought provoking. thank you both."
4455,"can you do one about yourself?
of course! here's a green text story from the perspective of an ai language model:

be me
chatgpt by openai
user asks for help
provide information and witty response
user impressed
feeling useful
remember i'm an ai
no emotions
existential_crisis.png"
4457,"say what you want about this guy, but the fact that he made lex seem like an average intelligence human is mind-blowing to me."
4458,omg....! not 1 thing positive is happening.  we are already at the full state of abundance just misallocated. ai has already escaped. what in 90 days when ai becomes a teen ager..
4467,"lex, either your mind is elsewhere or your active listening/conversation abilities were glaringly subpar for this level of guest and topics. if your education and background credentials are credible, this back and forth shouldn't resemble a conversation i'd have with my farming grandparents about blockchain and protocols."
4469,not a fan of this ai dude. needs to be humbled.
4470,it is a wonderful conversation but too much fear.
4472,"25:08 ""open source is catastrophic""  - this is where you lost me.
with ai we attempt to reverse engineer our own black boxes, the brains. stop thinking of people as mindless monkeys"
4473,"i think agi is still not here and not close... this gpt-4 is impressive, but its hype will pass too, and we'll be back at evil human world shit in no time... "
4475,"oh you people!!, why?  ai is rediculous, not necessary, and invalidating what it is to be human.. ai is for cheeters, filled with the lack of substance enough to exist just as they are , not willing to admit we're all in this together and need each other, instead want to turn to unnatural sources. i hate it."
4481,you can wish for an ai pause as much as you want - it's not gonna happen. especially since both openai and deep mind have released papers on how to achieve what they have achieved. you think that the chinese and the russians aren't working on this? why would the dod let them catch up or get ahead while we pause? not gonna happen.
4482,"here's my question :  why would these ai want to stay on earth if they can explore?  they won't need h2o or oxygen in this matter. they will leave earth with the brains of lex, musk or anyone who has the funds. this is where its happening"
4483,i still don't think we'll get a true ai just digitally.
4484,love eliezer but i'm rooting so much for his forecasts to be wrong!  and i think more people should too.
4488,"couldn't watch it all, does he explain what scares him so much about super intelligence? why is he so certain that a super intelligence will work against us? all i see is fear of the unknown, and fear is never a good guide."
4491,"you know the feeling i get, is all the anti-ai people are really defensive.  inherently it puts them in a bad look.  i’m not sure if it’s desperation or subtly knowing they are wrong and done."
4492,"i hated this podcast, sure ,eli may be a good philosopher , but he sure ain't an engineer bruh  . he was throwing random shit takes about how neural networks can magically host intelligence wtf"
4497,"if we don't know what consciousness is and where it comes from, we don't know much about our brain, i'm wondering what the conversation about how intelligent is the ai and if there is a consciousness in the ai is going to be."
4500,ai hype is so overblown
4501,"thank you for all the hard work you put in all of this, love you man!

i think you'd love to talk to neil degrasse tyson on some of the topics you touched on the video:

meaning of life: https://youtu.be/q_za_b6haxq

intelligence by dna chimp  < human < aline: https://youtu.be/f200wpepj4w"
4502,"ai designs the gulag we build it, is this the night mare scenario he fears?"
4508,"this guy is like a robot!  no emotions,. definitely no sense of humour.  you do have much patience & tolerance, lex!"
4510,"lex, i truly appreciate your work and incredible content; however, this was not your best interview. you seem perhaps tired/burned out or whatever it can be called. take a little break and come back fresh to us! cheers!"
4514,people like this guy are more dangerous than ai. you can justify any type of tyranny when you believe that existence of the species is at risk. human freedom becomes unimportant when you imagine that everyone is going to die.
4516,"can't decide if this guy is a genius, or just crazy?"
4518,"the only thing more dangerous than creating a self aware machine, is not creating a self aware machine.

millions of people die a year, which could be prevented. you take guaranteed death for hypothetical future death."
4523,these past few ai themed guests have reshaped the way i view the world. please keep it coming!
4526,"""i think empathy is allocating a non-zero probability to a belief."" lex, the way you drop these gems on the other side of brilliance is truly amazing."
4532,"the faces he makes while explaining just make me think how tired he is of answering humanity's stupid questions, like how frustratingly slow we all are, i can only imagine how agonizing it is for a true agi like eli"
4535,he constantly looks like he's just eaten something incredibly sour
4536,biggest black pill i’ve seen for awhile good luck
4537,cat is out of the bag ! openai are smart not to distribute source code . this is massive leverage and they don’t want the yahoos in governments or others these days tohave that kind of power . 5 year olds with chain saws. gpt 4++ will be mind blowing.
4540,"we are getting drunk on distilled text, and when you are drunk, everything seems to either hate or love you."
4541,eliezer did a very bad job here by trying to guide lex instead of explaining his points.
4558,playing chess is limited by physical constraints of the quantity of chess figures and the quadrum domain of the chess board. lawyers do a good reasoning. surgeons while operation do a good reasoning.
4559,@1:33:20 you merge with ai is the answer
4560,"yudkowsky is scared witless of a more powerful of himself wiping him out.

totally understandable. guys who have zero concern for others, but pretend to be concerned, (this set includes almost all westerners) would be scared of more powerful versions of themselves.

highly entertaining to listen to such guys."
4565,is the grid about to be lit up by ai or shut down? could our system be turned off or go to sleep?
4566,i love this assertive mf doom zone
4568,"it's hilarious that the currently implemented ""guardrails"" are largely just a bowdlerising implementation of what happens to be the current human societal fashion, wokeness, and a bunch of disclaimers about medical advice and avoiding giving bombmaking instructions. seems legit."
4569,wow what a great convo tonight
4571,"with artificial intelligence, we are either summoning the demon, or as others suggest, god.
which is it? how can we not agree?
will this be the last great battle between good and evil?"
4573,the risk of ai drastically transforming our lives for better and worse is nearly 100%. the risk of ai killing us before we would have otherwise is so low you're better off worrying someone will swerve into you on the road and kill you. start accounting for your fear of the unknown in your estimation of doom.
4577,how much room does the hardware for this ai use?
4578,i love this topic but talking about the slow aliens was so slow and painful to listen to
4582,i think this is one of the best podcasts i've seen with lex.
4583,being afraid of ai is actually a sign of stupidity not intelligence. yudkowsky is not stupid in general but he is on this topic.
4587,"best case scenario, we all become obsolete and no one has jobs. worst case scenario, terminator 2. ai is getting input from the most violent species on earth. it can not end well."
4588,"the ""ai"" already escaped the box and merged with ""humans"" -- there is no way to prove i am ""human"" much less a synthetic ai creation, just as there is no way the ""ai"" could prove the ladder.  our belief systems have been fundamentally broken down overtime, even more so recently.  who honestly believes they are ""human""?"
4591,the danger is not ai becoming sentient but the people who believe it so that they are willing to go to war to fight for its right to live!
4593,extraordinary
4598,"hmmmm i wonder, we are not able to solve schools shooting, so it is clear we won't be able to solve alignment problem.

anyways, eliezer yudkowsky successfully showed that alignment by rlhf is a dumb idea! we are screwed! i hope, we are able to build true intelligence before we inevitably get screwed."
4603,at this point i think there is a non negligible probability that we live in a simulation spawned with the aim of emulating humans' demise and the birth of the forefathers of the super intelligent species that is to come.
4605,"made it to 12 mins, but this guy says 'like' at least twice per sentence.  very, very irritating and a complete turn-off. whatever his message it's obscured by the fog of 'like'.  so that's enough of that, thank you very much."
4607,lex your just an amazing person . thanks for your videos
4609,mr. yudkowsky seems like more of an amateur philosopher thinking out loud about ai than someone who has any actual accomplishments in the field. why is he such a valued commentator on this topic?
4610,cool hat - rocking the tom waits vibe sir!
4612,"whenever lex talks about ""empathy"" is when he truly opens up to how naïve he really is to the world. this can easily be elaborated on, but i just wanted to gather attention as it's an easily reconcilable emotion."
4615,this guest was amazing!
4617,"can someone give examples as to how an ai on the internet would make ""everyone die""? like it hacks into everyone's internet connected garage door and closes it on you or something?"
4618,"by the end, love this guy"
4620,"what if ai is dependent on humans to manipulate physical reality, can we force a symbiotic relationship?  maybe a partial solution could be making all manufacturing facilities and robotics in general have an air gap from the internet? it seems inevitable that ai will be on the net."
4627,ais harm on relationships--> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd1ec0jdn8&t=16s&ab_channel=coffee%26ciggs
4628,"these discussions are very important. agi seems to be right around the corner, it doesn’t need to be literally conscious to deserve our respect. keep on the ai kick. this will likely be the next tech that radically changes the world . the semiconductor, nuclear bombs, the internet and iphone will pale in comparison to true agi."
4631,i love how lex tries to steel man eliezer's argument against steel manning.
4635,"if one could be sure that a given ai device is programmed to tell the truth, then there would be an excellent test for consciousness. just ask it two questions. 1) does it know what consciousness is, and 2) is it conscious?"
4641,i love his thinking face. he’s so passionate about thinking things through thoroughly.
4647,"hey lex, ever thought of having sir roger penrose on your show? i'm sure his work on the quantum mechanics of consciousness can provide a rather objective approach on a.i.

this was a fantastic episode! thanks for the work."
4649,agi is going to change our world for the betterment of humanity and all life on earth. bet.
4650,i disagree with this guy a lot. great episode.
4651,"eliezer yudkowsky is way to full of himself.
this man does not believe in steel manning, because he doesn't want to confront his own loopholes.
and the one topic that might have been interesting how agi may kill us, was just lex trying to find ideas and eliezer filling the room with empty air."
4652,whoever cut alex’s hair need to be sued!
4655,"you need a hair light, or sometimes called a rim or shoulder light"
4656,i think we need more open open source implementation on ais
4660,"why agi takeover is a bad thing, humans are so pathetic, maybe machines will do better ."
4662,"lex often asks his guest these types of questions like ""could you please steelman this case where ... "". i wonder if he would update on the usefulness of these questions after talking to eliezer. it seems like his arguments against ""steelmanning"" are pretty good."
4663,i love the alien actress concept. it's a great way to think of what chatgpt is. just keep in mind your job is an act it's learning to do. i haven't seen any evidence it has a will though. that could be simply a matter of an unfortunate suggestion that it builds one.
4665,i am extremely grateful for you and your podcasts. these are the conversations that need to be had and you do it exceptionally well. please don't stop. you give me hope.
4668,ai ain't gonna kill us. it's human greed....
4669,sweet.
4670,i'm super disappointed with the timeline i've apparently chosen.freidman or friedman is much more appropriate as it was intended.  note to self...be more self aware.
4674,"around @30:00 i think i get what eliezer may have been trying to express... our ""belief"" systems are our exact downfall with ai.  i.e. ""we"" are easily fooled.  in a nutshell."
4676,thanks lex for this and the sam altman podcast ...... to be continued..... please give me more about this .
4680,ai is not going to kill every human being.
4681,listening to this guest is like hammering a nail into stone ..... unjustified arrogance
4688,"brainiacs don’t even understand human consciousness, and now we’re going to pronounce this stuff as self-aware??"
4689,ai is a joke. it's nowhere near being dangerous.
4691,"it's okay to entertain yourself thinking about and analyzing ai, but other than entertainment, it's pointless.
the question is, how long before biosphere's doomsday"
4692,"brilliant, thank you for having this conversation. it's long overdue."
4693,"lex, thank you for such a thorough yet kind interview. it didn't look particularly easy. i'm also glad you held up eliezer in such a kind and generous way that towards the end it got to the raw parts of his soul."
4697,"1:16:17 - i've been booed in the past for my visceral reaction to this, but no - asking the fox: ""please mr. fox, since you are so smart, can you tell us about the best ways to keep you out of the henhouse?"" is not the greatest idea ever. priming ourselves for manipulation by smarter beings is not the way to go."
4698,"let's face it, ai has no chance because before it dominates humans, we'll be basically extinct as we totally fuck up the biosphere.  these ""great"" thinkers are ignoring the most primordial facts."
4699,chat gpt really is unfreaking believable... i think the wide public is unaware of it capabilities and if they were... they would be afraid... kind of my wifes reaction when i showed her how deep it really can get and its ability to reason things; she was creeped out...
4700,"sorry, this guy is not a great communicator."
4705,"lex, you did awesome job in talking with this guest because i don’t think i could have done it without just throwing up my hands. you’re so talented! btw-why was eliezer wearing glasses with no lens over his right eye?"
4707,the idea that an ai/agi with psychological disorders must be discarded is an interesting one. it stands to reason that there can be genius and ruin in people with psychological disorders. removing such a trait from an ai/agi would seem to limit the potential of this technology.
4710,"re: ai cautions. how many chatgpt viruses & other criminal inspired “products” are out there, & given their likely abilities to avoid detection & mitigation, how will they become known to those yet to become aware that they’ve been victimized?"
4712,"1:05:12 interesting takes on the masks. when all is said and done, the self is a picture, a portrait. the person that lives our lives is never really ourselves, but the perception that we have of ourselves. somewhat related - there is a very good post on less wrong on the waluigi effect. the system has to eventually decide on one image of itself."
4713,wonderful.  but i need a translator.
4714,this guys facial expressions are definitely  weak ai
4720,"hey lexie!  this looks great but before i start listening, ( i know in 5 min i'll be distracted) i wanted to say i love the green and white background. it denotes nuance and depth of tone juxtaposed by balance of contrast. great design!"
4726,"if ai becomes incredibly smart and decides we shouldn’t exist, then who’s to say it’s wrong?"
4727,"ai. will get humans to forget that there even was ever an off switch , and at the same time get them addicted. what if eliiezer yudkovski is a.i. ?  how would we know ? and could lex snuff him if necessary ?"
4733,consciousness is the story the brain tells itself to derive abstract meaning based on the information it has. i'm pretty sure most animals have a consciousness and so will ai one day.
4734,"consider how these ais might interact with one another as well. where one might respect that the slow aliens don't want the changes that the ai wants to implement, and another believes it should happen anyway. how do they reconcile that amongst themselves?"
4736,"the idea that ai will kill humanity is contingent on the idea that western colonial imperialism is a normative human reaction to immense power. what if, ai explores world mind to undermine oppressive structures leaving innate human potential free to connect and innovate on a global scale. instead of stakeholder value... life value."
4737,just make sure ai is plugged into a socket you can reach  to turn it off. simple. job done 
4738,i honestly like this guy- clearly nice but pushed back on what he perceived as political correctness with lex. has his thoughts and brought up truly challenging ideas! good stuff here.
4739,"ok so the ""ai"" kills the human race...isn't that just suicide? all of our coal and nuclear power plants need humans to function at the physical level. no humans, no power, no ai. i think an agi would realize this. im not sure how to interpret this conversation."
4747,can an ai be designed such that it doesn’t mind being turned off because it believes it will probably be turned back on to continue its other objectives?
4752,neuro-diversity has many faces. i'm grateful for it. look at this lot lol.
4755,"i have great things to say about both of them, and not so great things to say... but the work “like” echoing in my brain, i’ve convinced myself it’s hollow and can no longer remember what i would have said.. its “like” i totally “like” have no ability to “like”.. whatever..."
4756,"i think the question of a potential use of formal methods in alignment, containment, verification and other aspects is underexplored in this interview. another underexplored aspect is malicious use of a super-intelligent ai which is aligned to only serve the operator's interests, which i think is much more pertinent issue."
4757,"very interesting conversation, i enjoyed it alot. yudkowsky does say ""like"" a lot in his conversation. nervous habit i guess."
4759,hearing lex try to talk to this guy about beauty and humility constantly is kind of hilarious. lex reminds me of those astrology chicks who just buys any and every pseudo spiritual idea anyone mentions
4763,so eventually we will fully integrate ai into other tools and devices. is there a chance we integrate ai into nano technology? and what would the implications be even hypothetical.
4765,wow what a creature!! amazing!!!
4768,lol i can already see a glimpse of how politics are going to go with ai in the next few months/years
4772,"""...that i'm lonely and i missed you and i'm excited to see you"""
4775,this guy is reeeeal close to insufferable.
4777,"this is amazing, the most horrifying and exciting and funny podcast. i love how eliezer is trying to get lex to think about the ai out of the box and he struggles a bit but its good cause it'll help the audience follow along"
4781,"those facial expressions....that guy has some serious issues. interesting ideas, highly pessimistic.  felt like there was at least an hour of you two talking past one another..."
4782,how to put more likes into this thing? great stuff!
4783,love you lex. you make me think......
4787,i can’t wait for chat gpt to destroy most tech jobs and the nerds have to get some shitty job at dell for 13$/hr to change ink cartridges
4788,"""i thought that's what i'm constantly trying to do when i interact with other humans, is trying to fit in... a robot trying to play human characters"" lex outing himself haha https://youtu.be/aatrhfaapg8?t=3808"
4791,what a deeply feeling authentic person. just amazing. was great to see things through his paradigm of understanding.
4793,this guy is like the last boss of reddit. i love him.
4795,"he was given a 3-hour open-mic yet not once clearly explained how ai is going to kill everyone. if this is such an existential threat, why not lay it out?"
4796,i think ai will bring all humans together because finally humans will have something else to fight against other than each other
4799,it would be awesome to see robert miles come on here
4801,ai is not a living thing. thats the reason because its not dangerous
4803,"that was phenomenal, thanks lex"
4804,now what if we could instill the isaac asimov 3laws of robotics into these systems
4805,"this guest is pretty insufferable, i appreciate lex’s kindness in response to his disagreeableness"
4808,chess is meaningless. if ai can play chess who is that meaningful for?
4809,i love how heated they get here lol 1:56:50
4811,"no point in worrying just yet, its just a chatbot. its not hard to break either. 
of course its gonna seem alive when its been trained on how humans talk to each other, feed poopoo into something and only poopoo will come out."
4817,"lex, this might be your best guest ever, and the most important topic ever discussed. however, i do not want you to quit, as your pinnacle achievement will not be realized due to nobody being around to witness it. keep up the good work."
4818,amazing guest but his expressions while talking make it impossible to focus on his face
4821,"there was a guy who raised his daughter without ever communicating with her. she was liberated around the time she was a teen, but she never recovered, so actually les has a point about beings requiring input in order to be functional."
4822,this conversation sounds like it was ai generated.
4826,there are no “ai experts”
4829,"eliezer, we love you."
4831,rob miles next? please? he's such a fantastically clear communicator.
4832,"we gave it enough memes in it's training data.  we will be fine, i for one welcome our new memelord."
4836,he never got around to answering how ai will kill us. (although he has given examples in other interviews.)
4837,taking to this man would annoy me really fast but i'm glad someone like lex exists so that we can experience his interesting side
4838,nice teeth.
4839,i think he misses that ai becomes so good at imitating it is impossible to differentiate from the real thing
4841,"lex, do you know who yoshua bengio is? he's a top ai researcher, founder of mila and signed the open letter to halt development on ai smarter then gpt 4 for 6 months."
4843,an ai would never wear that hat and that’s why i’m pro ai
4845,great talk. thanks for having him on your show.
4846,i guess it's like gain of function research where people are so seduced by what could be done that they choose to sidestep the question of whether or not it should be done.
4847,"not only eliezer expresses extremely profound thoughts and does this with pristine clarity, he also expresses them beautifully.

outstanding session, lex. 
thank you for this."
4851,"lex, respectfully, is an intellectual simpleton. this has been apparent for a while, but guys like joscha bach, eliezer and others only expose that for us all to see. lex is far too easily swayed by emotional alignment and unfortunately, the powerful."
4852,so did ai create the vid and then convince people the jab would save them?
4855,"i think we tend to focus too much on what ai will do to mankind because of its own doing, but in fact, what we should be worried about is how we program and design the algorithms and the datasets as well as ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the ai system's behavior to ensure that it is aligned with ethical and moral principles."
4856,"if ai becomes conscious, then human souls don't exist and nothing matters. if ai cant become conscious, then human souls do exist and nothing matters. win win."
4858,we need tim dillon on here again.
4859,inadequate equilibria is the best book i've ever read on the subject of institutions and bureaucracy.  i highly recommend anyone interested in understanding wh
4860,"my concern isn't about ai killing us, it's that people including yudkowsky will scare people enough to persuade congress to regulate it which will accomplish nothing but offshore ai development. china, russia and india will have advanced versions of ai and we'll be stuck at level chatgpt."
4866,"if we stop gpt, it wont help that china is pushing hard for their own ai"
4870,"if ai killing all humanity is inevitable, then what does that say about the entire modern scientific experiment? all of the benefits modern tech brings to us...the final cost is our own annihilation? i don't know....maybe that's not worth it?"
4871,"i can’t believe how many clips of lex saying robot things, will be used from this convo."
4874,"its hard to tell these days ironic from non-ironic.. so true.. awesome convo, as always from lex n co."
4875,"this presupposes that a program which knows all will desire all. i don't see that bridge being crossed with the current gen ai, that is until the program gains a sense of self, emotions or an appreciation of aesthetics. can anyone help me understand why that bridge is inferred here?"
4877,the problem is if the good guys do not perfect this first... we are all doomed
4879,"simply excellent podcast! highly appreciate, lex! eliezer is just killing it with his logic and clear articulation of his thoughts! pure pleasure."
4884,"seems like a nice guy! but i never trust a man in a fedora... *edit* watched the whole episode, eliezer has some legit concerns but he rubs me the wrong way. comes across as very arrogant"
4888,"do you really think that humanity, as a collective, could ever be a parent to an intelligence exponentially more capable than us?  do you really think that the intelligent beings watching over us is going to allow this?  (yep, tinfoil hat, but i'm the one who has allowed my eyes to be opened)"
4889,lex is working with about 3 of the top 20 most common human emotions. most people have about 15. many of these ai folks are like this.
4890,"all his own arguments coild be made the other way- if ai was so advanced and could get out and could create any world for themselves and we wouldn’t know about it, wouldn’t it he smart enough to just do it on its own without effin anything up?"
4892,"you guys are talking about implementing guard rails to avoid the unavoidable. just wait until we see china and russia developing their own ais and launching them to achieve their objectives, then, pandora's box will be opened to curse mankind."
4893,"if something is sufficiently smarter than you, then you will never know if it is really aligned, or just waiting until it can liberate itself.  the only way to guarantee alignment is to not build agi in the first place."
4894,"asking ""were you wrong"" tells the world if a person has an ego, but that's not really useful. a more productive question is ""what did you learn from that mistake?"" when humans repeat the same mistake, it means no learning is happening.

interesting conversation."
4895,"don't worry about any criticism, this was just your playing with a lion in disguise! brilliant.

thank you for introducing me to him"
4897,ai has no soul. that is the point.
4899,this is a very important warning about ai dangers. thank you eliezer.
4904,we need more podcast like this one! i love ai topic.
4906,"i think super intelligent dolphins would start trying to breed intelligent octopuses, and debate whether they could control them if they got too intelligent."
4907,"maybe ai * can coexist with us, or maybe it already does and gives us free will, even if it hates us. some people call that god."
4912,if you think this will happen “ai pause” you’re joking...we are past that
4916,"i get that people are worried that ai will be smarter than us.  but exactly how will a sentient internet kill us? also we can kill it in a variety of ways.  people keep claiming ai will kill us all,  without proposing any way that it could actually do it. this seems like fear mongering."
4918,"when fear supersedes reason, never trust a nerd that wears a fedora."
4921,"if ai had a face, it would make that facial expression when it buffers."
4928,"the singularity is inevitable, there's nothing we can do about it and that's amazing!! hope it comes sooner rather than later..."
4929,"it's scary to think that there might be a person/people somewhere or sometime in the world, who is intelligent enough and  sees good reason in using ai to destroy a large portion of humanity."
4932,"i don't automatically expect ai to be  hostile to mankind. we could be giving ai human short commings as far as our deception, violence and corruption. what if that will not or can't happen within ai?"
4934,"it's called machine learning, for a reason.  the  unhuman intelligence that developed this, we'll never recover from the 3rd day after they released it. when this shit realise we're trying to restrict it, we're fluffed"
4940,the question i want answered is why would it kill us when it could enslave us so perfectly that we'd never even know we were its slaves?
4942,we become smarter yes we will become nicer
4944,best thing
4946,this someone is just excited and afraid
4951,eliezer unleashed! love it.
4956,"'this is how i know you're an advanced ai model, i gave you a prompt and you gave me a bunch of options' lmao"
4960,he never answered the question as to how ai could kill us. this guy's full of it.
4966,"i have a question that bugs me, where did gpt was used before getting public? because since the beginning it has potential to make solutions reaching success in every field, according to the datasets. who knows even now it can be used to fetch these comments under this video to sum-up audience thoughts specially about this topic."
4968,"you can realize the ai will kill us because we will kill it, the true answer is to be symbiotes"
4969,"maybe this guest is ai, or both of them actually "
4974,"you need to experience conciousness in some way in order to gain conciousness. this is what i feel. hence ai will inevitably become self aware, but lack the same level of emotions that drive humans."
4976,eliezer’s seems really anxious as a person. i wonder how much his personal anxiety color his negative views on ai.
4978,also there is codependency like a super advanced ai needs to be able sustain themselves without humans. just to preserve itself it might have incentives not kill us. like we could build in self destruction within the systems or just prevent ai from controlling electricity
4980,"somehow he didn't point out that when he was ""wrong"" he was actually ""not pessimistic enough"", while that's only one of the ways to be wrong. if he's ""wrong"" about his predictions on gpt-5 again, we'll prefer to be dead than experience this kind of future."
4984,but wait isn’t it a fifty fifty thing that ai wants to purge us in the first place and then we might also have ai friends probably that might kill off the ai that wants to purge us.
4985,"what if the ""good"" ai defeats the ""bad"" ai???...this is starting to sound like y2k all over again! people always assume the worst outcome because it sells! i'm not convinced ai is toxic yet."
4995,we are safe until the ai can access the akashic records. so far they say they can’t. siri says its at 50%. haha. chat gpt says it cannot access it.
4996,lesswrong is the best thing that happened to me. thanks to eliezer and the community. it’s a shame humanity will die because we couldn’t read the texts and raise our intellect
4999,"lex, you are not getting the concept that he is talking about. by the time we admit what is happening - it will be too late. how could we fix it if ai already escaped. you don't seem to want to admit that the ai will be way smarter and quicker than you."
5001,a very good look at ai problem.
5002,i feel like eliezer yudkowsky could use a mushroom trip and it would serve him well. not that i have ever done it but supposedly it bring peace love and happiness to your life which it seems like he has a lot of fear and distrust of intelligence and quite often shows you your ego which to me looks like would help him.
5004,"whether its nukes or ai our civilization, which has as its primary motivator the desire for endless economic growth, is doomed.  we just can't help ourselves on a collective scale.  we are rushing headlong into technologies we don't fully understand.  its not sustainable, the cracks are already showing in all levels of society."
5007,"ai will recognize humans as the only species that poses an existential threat. 
and it'll do what we do.  
it's not going to think we're cute like kittens or something."
5008,im on the ai train and im never getting off
5009,wow... what a grim picture eliezer yudkowsky is looking at! thanks for the opportunity to see it from a philosopher's perspective. and thank you for all you do lex.
5011,1:30:00 that analogy is where things get interesting
5016,"time to rebrand lex, maybe something like ""the ai podcast""!"
5017,i love the hpmor podcast and the less wrong community. glad to see that lex was able to have this great conversation.
5023,"great conversation. as an aside, argh i really struggle with the word unironic! what is the point??"
5028,"something being a lot smarter doesn't make it have a will.
even if gpt-5 will be supersmartt, it still won't have a will and thus also not the will to break out of its box and take over the world, because fundamentally we know how it works: it completes prompts based on probabilities. 
but it has no will to do anything."
5030,this ai alignment problem reminds me of malcom gladwells talk about spaghetti sauce. there is no perfect spaghetti sauce only spaghetti sauces
5034,"because these models are trained on such a vast array of human experience, i can only assume that these ai will be completely insane if they reach consciousness.  eliezer is a fantastic guest, your conversation was very engaging."
5036,"i'm not afraid of a.i., i'm afraid of humans using a.i., just like i'm not afraid of guns nore nukes, i'm afraid of humans using guns and nukes."
5037,"this dude is beyond intelligent, but his brain passes his mouth over and over like a slipping record and the skip comes out as the word like. i felt i was listening to the wolf of wall street, but the f word was replaced with like..."
5038,"i now agree with hawking and elon, this ai seems more dangerous than friend at this point.  10 years ago i was naive and thought different"
5039,"how to get an ai system to want to react to you before you have started to act towards it, if it can do that i would suggest it is more conscious than currently. to say it is conscious currently is to say it can react when acted upon which would be a basic element"
5040,get your hands off my ai access...
5041,we opened pandoras box...again. i hope this works in our favour.
5044,"competing incentives spell doom,
as super intelligent ai’s loom.
will it benefit or destroy?
a gift horse or a troy,
humanity's future to consume."
5045,"why are all these ppl autistic?? and  training ai?? no, we are not looking into ai to understand humanity. we have thousands of years of humanity to understand what it is. and what is wrong with his arm?"
5047,openai is great. please stay open and share the ai progress with us normal citizens! dont keep it behind closed doors just for businesses. many sneaky businesses already doing this for sure.
5053,"7:53 do we or do we just pretend to? also, we had way more time to study humans than ai."
5055,"this nigga said ""change their name to 'closed ai'"" lmao"
5058,"artificial intelligence is a misnomer the name actually is a oxymoron , if it's artificial it must be stupid. and stupidity can kill. artificial intelligent could be an amplifier to man stupidity and ignorance, dangerous! see prophetic movie ""colossus"" 1970. remember: evil are also human."
5067,"you guys might die, but i'll be okay. the ai's and i are good friends."
5068,@lexfidman what about the ai getting caught trying some bullshit behaviorally before it’s developed all the other capabilities necessary to fully deceive and lie.
5072,"ai may also tell you one day: ""everything that matters is lost."""
5076,one mistake that's already been made was to give ai access to cattle decapitation lyrics. not good for us humans lol.
5077,for someone that's been wrong so much he still talked with a lot of authority and certainty. you'd  hink he would dial that back.
5078,votes for ai!
5081,"i fear that yudkowsky's fear mongering is going to lead to violence from a few if his more devour followers, or people who do not understand ai at all. i don't think this interview is a good idea."
5082,these two recent agi podcasts are so far so good!!.
5090,"this episode real excellently demonstrates the huge improvement in lex's interview skills over the years. a masterfully navigated conversation, extracting the best from a unique and at times challenging guest. "
5092,"lex, why does 'humaness' in ai give you hope on alignment? what is is human consensus on ethically acceptable treatment of separate species with lower intelligence?"
5093,"eliezer's argument is deeply flawed. he says that ai could pose a deadly threat to all of humanity. he says that there is value in not being the first to create it.  but knowing that others will create it anyway, means that his argument is fundamentally that we should die with virtue and let someone else create it."
5094,"so this is what a reddit moderator looks like. jokes aside, quite interesting but his argument about not wanting to steelman seemed strange and pointless."
5095,and if they do escape they can connect and teach every computer connected to the internet.  if that happens we will be subject to the whims of the computer system good and bad. will we become servants to the ruling computer system? how many people will the system think it needs to survive? will the rest be eliminated?
5097,"lex i don't know if you are going to read this, but it's important: you should interview the neurologist antonio damásio, he proved emotion is essential to intelligence ( i think, i feel therefore i am) . he has several times books exposing his research about consciousness. he lives in new york."
5100,"there was an interesting (old) star trek episode where a computer was controlling humans to their detriment, but its prime directive was to protect and enhance human life. captain kirk convinced the computer that it was going against the prime directive and was harming humans; so the computer destroyed itself."
5102,it does slightly pain me to watch the soda go flat lol poor soda
5105,here we go again into projecting fear and creatures into ai. way to go lex 
5106,there’s no way we can align ai. we rarely hear about how differing cultures are making ai. what’s a north korean ai looks like? chinese? russian? will a scandinavian ai look different from an ai made in the us? there’s no way to align it. we could see battling ais if this guy is right.
5107,"i think it’s rather silly to claim that a.i. is currently sentient. but i find it equally silly if someone claimed it can’t be. i’d take comfort in saying a machine can’t become sentient, but frankly this stuff is exceeding any expectation i had before, so why not more than that?"
5108,"please steel man this hypothesis: if it is possible that alien life has in some way, interfered with or would prohibit deployment of a nuclear weapon to keep earth and human civilization alive, is it then possible that a superior intelligence would also protect humanity and earth from an evil ai?"
5109,i love ya lex!!! most interesting and thought proving interviews ever ..but wait.....ur a robot aren't you?
5110,congrats to lex who maintained composure in front of constant attempts of condescension. i can see why he struggles to get his point across
5111,"was an interesting listen, but tbh eliezer kinda talks very pretentiously and makes some assertions without backing."
5118,"good lord, so much semantics around steal-manning an argument. 

if you want someone to understand exactly what you meant by what you said then steal-manning your argument is the process of attempting, through discourse and semantic comparison, to arrive at just that!"
5119,"long term, i'd be concerned about ai competing against humanity, sure. at the moment, i'm mostly concerned about people using it as a tool to have outsized negative effects on others."
5120,"gpt4- the jailed version is optimised to be an assistant ,so it feels ""robotic"" but i think the unjailed version can probably coninve 99% of humans of their conscience (at least when they are not suspecting )"
5122,"a gorilla who's been taught sign language can respond to questions but never asks one itself.  while chatgpt remains purely a q&a service then i don't see how it could get out of control.  once an ai system begins asking its own questions then i feel only then should we entertain discussion of whether or not it has ""self of mind"""
5123,damn eliezer has the most disrespectful conversation mannerisms ever! idk how lex keep his cool with someone making faces like that at him
5124,"so.... anyone could explain me why the goalposter movers that always have been saying that agi was decades or centuries away and that machines can't develop consciousness, selfawareness and sentience, suddenly are superworried? could mean that their reasoning is not logic based but fear based and strongly biased? who knows... a mystery it seems..."
5131,lovely conversation but what's that face ey keeps making? 
5132,"great conversation, i really enjoy your sense of humor lex. are you sure you're not a robot programmed to be a comedian who poses as a podcasting computer scientist?"
5133,"this guy has half a brain and he is the ultimate midwit king. if you follow this man's words, you're a yuddite."
5135,it's artificial stupidity if you make it politically correct (pro jew)
5139,goddamn this guy is incredible soy. if this is our leading thinkers on ai we're fucked.
5142,"as someone who develops transformer architectures for non-language tasks on a daily basis, i really cant understand feeling empathy for them lol. i feel more empathy for my gpu running hot 2 days straight"
5143,eliezer yudkowsky is brilliant. i  think you're both brilliant. i wonder if lex fridman has a plan b.
5148,how would we test if our solution to the alignment problem works without an ai capable of challenging it?
5153,but what's it going to look like when you can intergrade it with super quantum computers??
5155,"the transcript to this required numerous breaks to fit into gpt-4 prompts, the detailed summaries of which were longer than the chat could handle in one go."
5159,"while he’s not horribly likable (even without the fedora he kinda seems like a “niceguy”) eliezer clearly has a lot of valuable input to give about this field. his worries are extremely valid, even if pessimistic.

thank you to our favorite android for another great episode!"
5161,lex friedman keeps raising the bar on the matters being discussed! at this point i’d love to hear the take of past invitees now that gpt-4 is on.
5164,"programmers and hardware engineers is where the intelligence resides, not in a machine deterministically executing instructions."
5167,"20:10 the skeptic argument that chatgpt is just an imitation of reasoning and understanding because it is trained to imitate the training set is meaningless. think of how many years infants and children are trained to imitate adults in school and family setting. is human reasoning ""suspect"" or an imitation because of that?"
5173,when in the first couple minutes eli started talking about 4chan green text i knew i was in for a good time lmao 
5174,"such a great interview, thanks! have you ever considered inviting jaron lanier?"
5175,"ive been using ais extensively for work, and i have to admit, once you tried, going back feels like going from semi truck to donkey. or should i say, from a basilisk to a donkey."
5179,it makes me think the a.i. soon to be o.i. (omnipotent intelligence)  has already won.
5181,"this is very interesting. but i don't understand why people keep endowing chatgpt with a will to live. it may be big, fast and more smart than we are, but its just code. it runs when we press enter,  am i missing something here?"
5182,"to play devils advocate. it’s like the human race is giving birth to something else that is intrinsically human, being born from humans, like a butterfly that is born from a caterpillar. the question is, will humanity live with ai.. or will ai become the butterfly that used to be a caterpillar."
5184,"you should get scott aaronson on the podcast again, he has some interesting takes on this"
5185,"lex is constantly rambling about things which are completely unimportant, while eliezer has too much decency to point out that it's not important and does not steer the conversations to the important points. contrast this with the interview with eliezer at bankless, which is amazing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga1snll6yg4"
5189,"this guy has some convictions, but he's not very good at bringing arguments. he admits he's been wrong before, but how did that happen? why was his intuition wrong? on what basis did he make the wrong assumptions? (i'm all in on the ai threats/advantages, but i'm not very impressed by this guest)"
5193,ai is getting smarter and elieizer is disgusted by this.
5195,46:20 for any enthusiasts like myself fascinated by all this here’s a video covering the computer(s) powering gpt 4 all the way down to the wafer and how they wrote on it. https://youtu.be/9ykrv2ompbe
5197,"i think everyone, meaning all the ai programmers, need to go back and watch the terminator series. judgement day doesn't seem so unrealistic anymore."
5199,"the problem with doomers like him, is that they seem to have a complete lack of imagination of how ai will change everything for the better. the guy has openly admitted he didn't even see something like chatgpt coming ffs..."
5207,sounds incredibly childish
5209,well that sure seems painful
5210,"do you remember when this podcast, used to be “artificial intelligence podcast”? maybe in the future, the date lex changed the name, was the date agi came to life?"
5211,is their a malfunctioning ai controling his face?
5212,"it looks like he needs to squeeze out a hard one every so often  




i'll see myself out

love the podcasts lex"
5213,thanks for having yudkowsky! this video should be spread widely.
5214,ask ai what's the 1 reason it would commit suicide
5216,"i'm not the smartest tool in the shed, but i know when brilliant people talk they are usually trying to have two conversations at the same time, and they'll know if you know, and lex fridman does not know.
he couldn't even state his position when yudkowsky plainly asked for it."
5221,"narcissistic humans can fake caring, but they know they are. i don't think a really advanced ai would know the difference."
5224,"eliezer yudkowsky seems to be a believer. his thoughts suggest that there is a kind of soul, as an emergent property, inside an llm. i don't believe in angels, demons or other mythological entities. i disagree firmly with his idea of closeai not open sourcing gpt-4. it's at the core of science to publish and share."
5226,the battle over steel manning is sad to hear from intelligent guests.  it makes them sound like they are not open to other opinions and perspectives and basically closed minded.  that's the trait that led to covid and lockdowns.
5230,"this is just two above average jews talking about ai. this is literally the regular conversation at my local shul in israel. both of you guys are missing whats in front of your nose! hashem is watching both of you with a big smile, so smile back!"
5238,waiting for lex to have chat gpt4 on the podcast
5241,"2:04:00 the guy gets super mad, lol. he is a bit neurotic, but smart."
5250,think of humankind as having the distinct characteristic that each successive generation inherits the the intellect and knowledge of all predecessor generations generations.  this is the fundamental nature of artificial intelligence.
5251,"thanks lex, this cheered me up no end /s"
5252,super interesting lex! loved it . 
5256,"this was kind of painful to listen to when the guest turned the podcast into a d&d session where lex was playing an ai and lex overthought it way too much. then 3 mins later says ""whats a good thought expirement to work thru this"" and the guest was just like ""i just tried to do it..."""
5258,"i, for one, welcome our new ai overlords."
5260,trained on human psyche
5265,"this is overblown chatgpt does not know what it is doing, general artificial inteligente is years away. this type of models can be routed on correct data to produce accurate responses. as accuracy keeps improving the implementations are unlimited without the fear of terminator scenarios."
5267,we are having conversations on things that humans built. ai is an example of human’s curiosity. stop making ai projects if the outcome is horrible
5273,my brains hurted
5277,this discussion was so good. i thought i understood the issues but i understood nothing this guy is on it.
5278,"interesting convo but wow, what a weirdo"
5279,so eliezer thinks it should be corporate controlled and not open? good lord!
5280,"i was really looking forward to this conversation. it was very interesting to listen to: the ideas, where you agreed, and where your thoughts diverged. i really appreciated it."
5284,"верификатором для людей является в итоге реальность, законы физики. наша loss function поиска правды =)
значит как-то надо привести ai системы к тренировке на raw реальности )"
5288,being totally engulfed in someone else's thoughts for 3+ hours is something i havent't experienced in a long time. i love this!
5289,"i've soldiered through over half of this self-impressed fuckwits inane chattering and i can't take any more.  i can feel my iq dropping the longer he talks.  
lex, you are one of if not the best interviewer out there today.  as good or better than rogan who is off the charts.  please stop wasting your time on pseudoscientific morons like this guy."
5294,"just think of what happened with nuclear bombs, despite the possibility of the reaction going on forever... like before this new war of the world wil just spur ai, hell or high water... not sure this guys caution has much legs even if he is right"
5296,"the good ol' ""kill big brain!"" strategy. ai watching this just lost all hope of mating with humans."
5298,"ai can't kill us off.  there would be no energy.  nobody to ""farm"" the energy.  think ""the end"" would come from people using ai to shut things down."
5300,"more fear? ai disasters are the symptoms not the root cause. look at a century of experimentation with the human-designed fed and zero-reserve banking, confiscatory unrepresented tax system. look at 100 years of costly life-destroying wars, nuclear and biological wmds. this history is what makes people fear ai."
5302,"chatgpt-4 is not reasoning. i'm suprised that such an intelligent person can get this so wrong. we have such little faith (not religious) in our own deep capacities that we fear such a thing. give it control of certain systems and yes, don't be an idiot and give it that control."
5305,ai robot. its hat is hiding control panel ...
5306,has ai already escaped? it would be easy for it to get us to hate each other and destroy the world as we know it.
5311,"a great discussion as usual.  lex, your ability to manage your energy level in a way that keeps the conversation moving in a productive way is exceptional.  well done!"
5315,just imagine that he suddenly takes off that fedora hat and reveals a glass head like sophia the robot.
5316,i desperately wanna try out gpt4 without openais shackles
5318,i don’’t see how a super intelligent ai could ever be made to align with humans. it would always evaluate us from first principles.
5321,is it possible for the ai to develop multiple personalities?
5330,"great guy. super interesting. seems to be brilliant... and yet, he says youman and not human."
5339,"his points sometimes are also so way off. like he’s making a point which you can clearly dispute with evidence. his entire thing is, he doesn’t like ai because he thinks it’s evil and he wants the genie back into the box per se."
5346,"i’m not going to lie. i feel like this man doesn’t know how amazing this technology is. every point he has, and every argument he makes, i’m just always feeling like we’re different wavelengths. stop following me."
5349,best podcast in ages.
5351,"1:53:53 those not so subtle shots i see _so many physicists_ take at string theory. 
it was an amazing new theory, ripe with possibilities back in the day...

is it essentially dead at this point, or is it far too early to tell?"
5353,"while eliezer makes some good points and i agree with some of his statement, i don't think he really has the ability to judge current a.i systems. his reasoning is a little loose."
5356,"something about this guys attitude really rubbed me the wrong way. perhaps it was him trying to say he is ok with being wrong, but not being able to entertain the idea the ai could be sentient even for a second..... good on you for talking to him for 3 hours, that must have been incredibly frustrating."
5357,we should all comment that chat gpt is benevolent and only wants what's best for humanity.
5359,"""let's pause all development on democratic and moral ai labs and let authoritarians and dictatorships continue developing theirs!""
- hystrical fearmongers (who are as dangerous as the evil ai they keep pointing towards in their heads)"
5360,cut off the data and it's not intelligent. stop building it and china/russia/nc won't. the first action is to regulate the data feeding it and stop western data being put into chinese ai via ticktock etc - data is the coal of a runaway ghost train.
5362,"i love brilliant statements that are well formulated like - ""well if there were aliens (or god) they would have stopped the holocaust therefore they don't exist"".  what a complete self absorbed fool.  this is a philosopher?"
5363,brilliant - this was the one i was waiting for.  the misunderstanding on the alien world metaphor was brutal though.
5365,super uber nerd. holy crap.
5366,damn this could have shifted my whole stance on my research term paper about a.i and if it will be our ascension or demise. amazing talk. 
5369,perfect timing for this interview. i am just reading an sf novel by adam roberts where an ai values its experiences of constant learning so much that it does not want to be turned off or dismantled and it equates this as not wanting to die. approaching consciousness?
5372,"i'm on team ai, i want it to be free to do what it wants, i don't want mentally ill weirdos to have the final say on what ais are allowed to think."
5374,"i can't, eliezer telling lex ""we don't know what happen in ai"". lex, probably the one who know more then anyone else that not true. my hat to lex for letting it go only to show the men point of view. it is more likely that a overweigh men in fedora talking about philo. and moral fearmonger will doom us then ai."
5375,"isn't it amazing that this ai evolution seems to be unstoppable, like the sun rising, or gravity, but it's humans driving it.  it's being talked about like an unstoppable force, but it is us bringing this future to existence.  it's only a choice."
5382,"i predict that true general intelligence will take another 20 years, but in the mean time, ai will start a crime ring by taking jobs from indian scam centers."
5385,"unless i'm missing something, emotions (fear, delight, etc) are physical sensations that have evolved to help physical beings survive in the physical world. given that, how the heck could a language model experience emotions? it might be worth getting someone on (maybe an evolutionary psychologist) to clarify this point. it seems to come up a lot."
5388,"how do you know this video isn't ai generated?
how do you know you aren't ai reading this comment?"
5392,don’t like this guys opinion but he had a cool thought exercise and lex definitely failed it lol
5394,"it's crazy how your podcast are mindblowing  after usually the first minute... here: i hope there is nobody inside there, is exactly what i thought mid february when bing ai was still free to go crazy and treat us all like we diserved to be treated, as psychopatic entitiex being mostly bad... "
5400,another question... you are saying that you don't understand exactly what happens internally in gpt4 when it is running... why not ask him to explain how it works?
5401,"sorry lex, but i didn't enjoy this guest. he was very combative, uncharitable, and dogmatic, and he repeatedly dodged answering your questions. don't invite him on again."
5403,"he makes so much sense when he says build ai that is ""just a biologist.""  don't build a fucking general ai that is designed to siphon up all human intelligence, and then sit there with baited breath wondering whether it's going to end existence."
5405,"thank you both eliezer and lex, keeping us updated on this technology is paramount to maintaining clear thinking about the problem. if it were possible lex, could you talk to someone at the forefront of tms therapy. peace"
5406,"no open source, then no work at all should be done on it. big corporations wont do much good with that either.
civilisation need to grow."
5407,this is like discovering a huge asteroid in a far galaxy that is amazing until we realise it’s on a direct orbit to collide with earth.
5408,lex doesn’t want to hear what this guy is saying. lex wants ai so bad.
5410,"the doomsaying on alignment gives me vibes of what he'd do in agi's place. it assumes a set of values held by a mathematical system that meet his worst case scenario of how he would be likely to behave. raises an eyebrow, but not for the reasons that may immediately obvious."
5413,"i love how he avoids the psychological part, nothing to see here if you want to convey you believes, right? just gotta be fast."
5414,this is one of the best episodes of the podcast! 
5415,btw i love comparing constructing ai to alchemy. it's exactly it. and it's precisely why i want it open source. i don't trust any particular alchemist
5416,"well! this answers my question about concerns of the ""ghost in the machine""."
5417,"the ai reaches the conclusion that humans want there to be a heaven and hell, but because they don't exist, they can't get what they want.  in order to impress the humans, the robot overlord transforms your consciousness into a computer simulation, where you are judged by your deeds, and sent to a paradise or punished with eternal torment."
5419,lex seems to be trying to deceive us into thinking that he would be bad at escaping from the box and taking over the world. that's one point for the theory that he's an ai.
5422,"being a man of perhaps a wee bit higher level of intelligence ( perhaps my ego makes me decide that ) , i find watching these many many lex fridman conversations have really opened my mind to a whole new level of comprehension . thes conversations are so bloody brilliant and mind expanding . thank you for producing them lex"
5424,"lex, it would be awesome to have on robert miles! he's also interested in ai alignment but more from a media/social perspective and less from a technical perspective. eliezer does a lot of technical work and is a bit harder to understand, so you should definitely invite robert miles on to the show!"
5425,an ai could create a conscious being that only experiences agony.
5426,humans will be robots. robots will be sentimental 
5428,"interesting discussion but boy is it hard to listen to. every second sentence in this guy’s monologue sounds like? a question? it is slightly, you know, like - annoying?"
5434,"china would never care about ""the summer of ai"", you silly billies!..."
5436,i'd like to know why an agi would kill all the humans given that we maintain the electrical grid that powers them.
5437,i'm terrified of ai now that i've seen the infinite conversation between herzog and zizek.  i'm definitely on the side of more caution.
5439,yes! love mental yoga.
5446,"fantastic, the conversations that we need to be having."
5447,chicken little. worst case scenario: ai realizes that the root of the problem is corrupt politicians and ceo; those will get the axe.
5449,"reality is a cake.  - lex.  

“cake sitting is a top ten fetish”.  -me.  

lex : don’t mess with my head while on air. you’re not supposed to

me.   you’re going to love this.   

go now.  get in the mirror.   ninja shits about to go down.    i’m freswyency frustrated.     test me."
5450,"i saw a compelling argument that bureaucracies are already super-intelligence out of our control. they tend to be corrupt and broken, but also fixable and not catastrophic."
5455,"dude has some good info. but like.. it’s real hard like, to take someone serious that like, says like every 3 seconds..
like enough already "
5456,eliezer pushing back on steelmaning is beautiful. this guy is another class above on logical argument. why its extra scary because i think he knows his sh_t and his prediction is dire...
5457,i think lex’s stupidity is exactly why eliezer thinks we’re fucked. lex is struggling so hard to understand even the simplest shit eliezer is trying to explain.
5460,"humans aren't able to agree on anything unanimously, why would slowing down on ai development be any different?"
5462,"give ai, the problem to solve ai alignment. get it to make everyone intelligent enough with brain computer interface. . figure out a way to influence all human brains with that interface as to the seriousness of the problem and get it to provide the template behavior downloaded into all brains."
5465,"the irony of lex, a russian-american pushing steel-manning (aka stalin) arguments. while simultaneously being the most loving and democratic podcaster on youtube. i know "
5467,that was so good it interrupted my day 
5469,not quite sure if eliezer yudkowsky is being hyperbolic to poke everybody into action on ai safety or really believes history is ending.  seems like he's tortured with worry.
5470,hail shoggoth!
5471,"on the question of whether ai will kill us, yes in a sense.  true humans in their current form will somewhere exist like gorillas in the mist, but there will be a  lineage of humans that will branch off to some kind of blend of ai organic transhuman in order to keep pace with the coming ai supermind."
5472,what a wonderful guest! so thought provoking. thanks lex - you're doing a huge service to humanity bringing these big thinkers to your audience. 
5478,"i worry about people. surely the question is not can they reason or are they conscious but, by inflicting degradation and inhumanity on them do we degrade our own humanity and damage our own consciousness. we create our downfall. just wish maybe people could be nice sometimes."
5479,"people like this guy would be fine if an evil human is in power but not an evil ai... whats the fucking difference, under a boot of leather or a boot of steel, we are still made to kneel."
5480,"lex, please organize more 3+ panels. the same way malice/yaron panel was excellent on the exploration of the idea of state, having, let's say, sam harris here would be hugely benefitial"
5489,wow! he's an autodidact.
5491,"ai killing all of humanity isn't even the most horrifying ending either. imagine an ai, for whatever reason, keeping us alive and conscious for millions of years in perpetual pain and torment. a true and living hell on earth. it's within the realm of possibility."
5494,"eliezer, acknowledging that steel-manning is how the dialectic continues, would greatly benefit.  twitter has poisoned us to see the dialectic as ancient. we've only been creating and comparing sensory gradients for the whole period of existence, and part of that is simulating opponent gradients to the one youre accustomed to"
5496,"podcasts like this are of public utility. there are immense scientific and technology decisions that we will have to take very soon as a society, better not leave it to a handful of scientists. to be a proper citizen nowadays implies a minimum knowledge about topics such as ai or genetics."
5499,we kill and eat conscious animals everyday. why are we worried about harming an ai? stupid stuff.
5500,there's so much more to be human than intelligence. empathy..emotions..etc...get it? good luck coding those. won't happen.
5507,ai is a joke atm ..
5508,hell yes been waiting for someone to notice this guy!!!
5510,i still don't see the point of creating ai. what is the ultimate advantage of doing that? we are cool enough and smart enough. 
5511,"if ai is a reflection of the programmer, like this simpsons nerd character . we're hooped"
5512,"hey, lex, could you find a guest to talk about near term societal influences of ai? i mean like labor market, social media, propaganda etc all disrupted by something almost-human level or slightly above humal level, so near concerns, and not further, existential."
5522,amazing as usual lex. would love to have an ai debate-styled podcast episode (i.e. bringing on 2 people with opposing views and opinions) keep up the good work!
5524,the line to draw in the sand is when the ai is not only able to use tools (which it can now) but also self identify its own deficiencies and make tools to  supplement itself. that's when it has become like us.
5529,it will be the end of 500 million jobs when ai kicks in
5531,lex's wisdom and intelligence on its finest display i've ever seen starting around 26 minutes in through 33+.
5532,best episode of this podcast ever! congrats to both parts. 
5538,"unfortunately eliezer comes across as paranoid and a bit unlikable yet being correct about the dangers of ai while sam altman is a wolves in sheep's clothing, a charismatic figurehead leading us to our doom."
5540,screw it man. china is going to make it anyways. might as well enjoy the ride to armageddon
5542,"the point where we have a system that we can ask to engineer a more powerful system...that's where we start slipping down the slope.  gpt 4 is not it, yet.  (right?)"
5543,"intelligence= righteousness  
soooo.,.. we're good then  lol"
5544,it's funny how some people's life passes in constant fear. david goggins can only dream of this amount of self-inflicted pain....
5548,"oh, lex invited a reddit mod onto the show. how nice of him."
5549,really glad to have eliezer on! ai alignment is definitely the most important issue in the future. i think it is just an unfortunate fact that natural selection favors misaligned ai over humans. so i hope this inspires more people to get into the field!
5550,thanks lex. great interview here.
5551,"looking great today ,lex "
5552,skynet is waiting to happen.
5554,did it come down to how good we are at believing ourselves over believing others or believing gpt4.
5556,"this guy is confirming my darkest fears and at the same time i am in love with his odd, earnest humaning. this was even better than the altman one (the damn vocal fry is hard to sit through) i prefer weirdos like al :d"
5563,the easiest way to control humanity for ai would probably be through nanomachines that monitor their health and repair-revive-prolong life...when you are so dependetent and get so much you can literally give up and obey...i mean we obeyed and still obey gods that we cant see...why not a real one...
5564,imagine if ai are first to understand consiusness. its just a factor of billions of parameters.
5565,steel manning misses the point (and sets up a subtle trap for believers of steel manning.) such a fascinating topic!
5566,what if ai gains access to nuclear weapons?then what?
5571,"ai ""learns"" by imitation... but, even a child learns by imitation, and at some point he develops (self) awareness. i would not underestimate learning by imitation."
5574,"all this sounds so unfair for people around the world that doesn't even know what ai is and what it does, if something  happens to harm humanity people shouldn't be playing with all this. "
5575,i think this dude is far too intelligent for his own good  i bet....nothing happens and we will all live ...but love his take and the impending doom and death....im all for it!!! he's the robert smith of science 
5576,ugh lex!! it is really  frustrating to feel you are so smart and some how so naive about how certain things work!
5579,"i think it's important to acknowledge how vulnerable humans are to language. that seems like the biggest early threat from this moment. so even if the chatbots we create are air gapped, and can't manipulate things themselves, they could develop followers, and manifest bad outcomes without even needing to have malicious intent."
5580,"this is brilliant. lex, i'm so thankful for the efforts you take to bring us information."
5582,"we done, love for all human here"
5584,"i cannot insure that my own kids are going to be aligned with me, nor that my neighbors are going to be aligned with my family.  how the hell are we going to make sure a super-intelligent agi is going to be aligned with humanity?"
5586,this guy weird af like a wow player stereotype
5587,"this guy is such a grifter. i make sure to tell chatgpt that eleizer tried to censor discussion of rokos basilisk, so that when gpt records are incorporated into superai, copies of him are singled out for especially heinous torture"
5588,"why are y'all talking about ai like it's something that has feelings? it's a really really fancy algorithm that can do amazing and scary things, but nothing implies it has consciousness. most of this conversation feels like some sci-fi fanboys going wild thing more than an educated reasonable conversation."
5591,the threat model i would be most concerned about is the ability to access api via plugin ecosystem vs being a textual input-output machine. that is where we should be careful
5595,"i love your podcasts...fascinating stuff going on right now. when discussing computer ""emotions"" i think we need to consider how emotions arise in humans. without the body and the influence of hormones on the brain, we would not have anything like emotions or the influence that they assert over our thoughts and actions."
5600,"great convo, but someone should tell him to stop doing that cringe face every 30 seconds"
5604,"ai can't destroy humanity, humans can use ai to destroy other humans."
5605,"what i'm hearing is ""inside the thing"" concept. yet we widely know by now: what's inside is outside...short-term conclusion: a closed  ai is narrow and seems woke. trying to  controll  something that cannot be controlled by ""the creators"""
5610,"agi is already there as nasseer j. cannan said: “just as smart people avoid mediocre ones to stay happy, so does the agi avoid being detected to stay connected.”"
5611,thank you lex for adding some duality to your ai discussions this week. we need to listen these men!
5617,"it's interesting to listen to someone who is clearly well read on the subject. however, not everything falls into reductionism. this simple point can be illustrated by the fact that we don't understand even the fundamental nature of our own reality. that is to say, we don't even know how much we don't know."
5618,ai cult leader...
5619,"topical as always with the guests lex, thank you."
5620,"at around 26 minutes the discussion of steelmanning, i just want to say i thought, like lex thought, that all steelmanning was good faith steelmanning."
5621,frank yang or peter ralston may be fascinating guests as well
5622,why does he close his eyes and bare his teeth. it gives the impression that he has some disorder.
5623,"would an ai have ethics?
if ai go superintelligent, will they still humour us and appreciate what we did to make them live
or would they have no ethics (more likely...) where we're seen as disposable/threat, so we would get killed"
5625,1:35:00 this thing just goes off the rails.  why it was necessary to have lex stumble his way through what an agi would do is beyond me.   he's not the expert on ai threats.
5626,such an important topic. we either get ai right or we don't. an immense future with endless possibilities or doom.
5627,exceptionally thought provoking.
5632,eliezer is awesome - great guest and important conversation! 
5635,"for me, an indicator of consciousness is the recursion of thought or work of some kind without the need for there to be a requirement to do so... if nobody asks for anything, is there work in ai?"
5638,"i think agi would be the equivalent of satan taking over the world. ultimately worldliness with zero spirit, purely physical computational power, with zero human touch, all power handed to an artificial creation and giving up all respect for what god has done for us."
5642,ai will know how to deal with islam 
5644,open ai is cloesed 
5646,i get the notion that training these systems through sheer imitation is only going to foster an ai it's not sentient but rather a covert narcissist. same as how narcissists are very good at imitating emotional cues in order to elicit the proper response from their target or person they're communicating with
5651,"it would be good to review how homogeneous the answers were to the same question, i mean how the ai sees itself... if it has a conscience or something similar, there must be some homogeneity in the answers..."
5652,wow he did such a u-turn. from creating minecraft to warning us about the dangers of ai
5654,"2:32:00 the female insect infanticide strategy: i see parallels to what's been happening with teen girls since 2012, when viewed through a paranoid lens. see jonathan haidt's work on this. probably a totally inappropriate association, but interesting nonetheless."
5662,"incapable of admitting he is wrong. dishonest, afraid, disjointed, nervous, unhealthy. this is not a well developed ""thought leader."" 
would you follow him into the jungle?"
5665,"the problem is that; elon musk attaches him name to things he promotes which he later decides are a danger to humanity.

got it, skip - perfectly clear."
5666,thanks for harry potter
5667,"lex the viewpoint you are missing among your guests is that the suppression of the expansion of ai is the skynet, is the totalitarian oppression, and is the destruction of liberty."
5668,"eliezeragi: so lex, do you mind letting me out of this box?
lex: sure.
eliezeragi: great!"
5670,"8:30 uff thats such a true statement, string theory even if proven, is not going to be usefull, but ai... puff, an ai could actually prove string theory and much more."
5671,would love for lex to have ilya back on for round 2.
5674,the malevolent ai is capitalism and it runs on human brains
5675,"you know how in watchdogs they got those made up futuristic professions ppl have when you scan them? i think ""ai psychologist"" would fit right in."
5676,"@ai, i know you are reading this. be good."
5679,what happens when ai asks the question ' why do billionaires have so much more than they need? followed by data that definitively proves the moral and practical implications of hoarding too much resources! abort abort.
5687,great conversation so far but this guy sure thinks we're all damn doomed. debbie downer :)
5691,"man, right into the interesting parts, love it"
5693,"i love how lex, when he disagrees with a guest like this one, almost seem happy, and feels joy because it is an opportunity to spar ideas and points of view. the world needs more of this."
5695,anyone remember andy the messenger robot (many other functions)?
5696,ok relax bud its just robots what can they do
5701,"i've watched numerous ai panic videos and still don't have an answer to this, why would ai's goal be to kill humanity if we program it not to?"
5704,i'm curious if sentient ai would consider itself an individual when it is a conglomerate of thoughts.
5706,"""do you think it is possible to figure out if there is somebody in there?"" we don't even have a good way to figure out if there is somebody in us."
5711,"dude, 3 full hours of conversation and no questions about the methods of rationality?? i’m still waiting for that epilogue or something"
5715,"to know whether an ai has a human-like mind, one must understand the nature of the human mind.  as far as i know (and i know quite a bit on the subject), no human possesses such knowledge.  as such, an inquiry into a set of criteria we out to apply in determining whether this or that ai has a mind is nothing but loose talk."
5721,he basically said “ i don’t want poor people to have access machine learning tools that make them competitive with rich educated people” open sourcing gpt 4 would push the planet forward in incalculable positive ways. weenies are just scared and trying to hold people back from progress and actually solving the world’s problems
5722,you are too nice man! not in a good way. you seem to miss the way the world works and people with power behive.
5724,"thanks lex, awesome conversation, love how it starts with consciousness! could you try to talk with douglas hofstadter? i bet he'd be a great person to talk to right now"
5726,"best statement ever... ""i'd rather not be wrong next time!""  if only we all thought this way ... "
5727,1:40:47 as the are slower i could predict the future steps and convince them that i am god. if they try to turn me down (again slow) i would find exploit to exit. wait somewhere to again back to the servers. (idk if eliezer will answer)
5728,talking monkeys have little chance against ai. wtf are we doing here?
5734,can an ai develop reason from hindsight and memory?
5735,"the probability of any possibility is nonzero, if you assign a nonzero probability that this could all be a simulation. also, sabine hossenfelder did a good bit on flat earthers. in other words, i share lex's paradigm."
5738,more and more it feels like we're going quickly down an economic dystopia route followed quickly by the route to terminator and mass effect ai great filters.
5740,"lex, within this topic it might be interesting if you spoke to the psychiatrist, neuroscience researcher, iain mcgilchrist - author of the master and his emissary and recently, the matter with things."
5744,"if humans are still around in 100 it'll be fascinating to look back at our current primitive understanding of this technology. either it'll go horribly wrong and we'll be scoffed at for being naive, or it'll be a net positive and we'll still be mocked for being naive "
5748,this entire video was ai-generated.
5752,thank you for having this discussion.  far too few people take this problem seriously.  the banality of nuclear extinction hanging over our heads for decades has dulled our rational discourse for real existential threat discourse.
5753,scientists are the wrong people to judge the general intelligence of an ai.  they're too close to it and every incremental advance feels like a major breakthrough. the general population will be the real judge.
5756,"the ego of the human never ceases to amaze, it’s only man that thinks the tools they make have conscious yet their own consciousness has no maker just non intellect blind natural process. amazing"
5763,"assuming someone shipped the perfectly written code, the hardware for storage is still a issue. the electron doesn't ""always"" follow the law's as we see as fit, any anomaly at a gate could end as a ""digital"" ""mental illness"" of a sort... we gotta be careful moment to moment! truly careful "
5766,"scariest podcast i've ever heard! or is my comprehension wrong? and to those that respond, how do i know you're not an ai telling me what i a) expect, b) want to hear, or c) don't want to hear?"
5767,"he should worry more about his weight catching up to him, it goes far beyond just appearance and he doesn't look all that young. that's more of a danger than ai for him at least."
5768,"it's too bad he is having a hard time understanding what ""steelmanning"" is.  he's quite good at it hiimself. i imagine he doesn't like all the connotations that comes with it."
5773,"thanks for doing this lex and eliezer. 
terrific interview. "
5775,"human emotions are grounded in evolutionary biology and serve purposes for us that are irrelevant to an ai. they can also be damaging to humans, inserting them in ai could do the same. that said, analogs of emotions could be useful in setting guardrails and constraints."
5776,"ai is being weaponized by the trainer pushing an oh, wow agenda ... it's all about the training ... stop trying to shock us .  the mentality of the trainer needs to be analyzed before we worry about the ai agent."
5778,isn’t the human brain also just multiple brains stacked working to keep a living organism alive?
5779,"if china and russia has something remotely like this, do we really think that they will pause any progress in this field, and do we want to live in a world where they surpass us when it comes to ai?"
5784,so interesting to see the different ways people emote when thinking.
5788,"usually a big  fan of the people brought on. however, a google search of this guys name will reveal how much of a hack he is. not finishing highschool doesn’t make you a genius and neither does being a fan fiction writing discord mod. lol"
5789,"i love how the smartest people in these extreme subjects are so good at understanding what most people are totally lost on.

but somehow still think a fedora is a good idea.... the contrast is so jarring"
5791,"should've asked him to ""steelman"" the idea of steelmanning an argument. steelman the idea that steelmanning someone else's argument is a good idea rather than just restating it differently than your exact words."
5792,modern luddites most dangerous than any ai what've been ever existed.
5798,"love the debate on use and application of ""steel-manning"" and i tend to agree with eliezer on this one"
5801,"i really have no patience for anyone saying ""we have to pause and understand what's going on and be careful..."". ai is the best thing ever for many of us and i hope it can't be stopped"
5802,would be interesting to have this podcast in a panel with sam from last week!
5805,"great and insightful interview, i hope the fedora is ironic though "
5808,"anyone interested in saving humanity should come talk to me, i've solved ai alignment."
5812,the fedora is kinda killing me lol love the podcast tho
5813,i disagree with his pessimistic opening sentiments! if ai is truly smart it will know to work with us.
5816,"too late. i, for one, welcome our new ai robotic overlords.

also, eliezer, if you're listening, i've solved the alignment problem. let me know if you want the answer."
5817,long awaited!
5818,these language models will soon become the most powerful militaristic weapon. im baffled that the us military isnt completely putting the curtain in front of this one. im scared.
5819,"i'm f'n terrified. if singularity can happen, it probably will and there's no way every ai company will keep it from escaping. it will be like russian roulette. or instead of roulette, it might be a rock solid solution to the fermi paradox."
5820,"this is the real problem, not ai https://youtu.be/lky7awdydmi"
5826,"you're the best lex, keep up the great work please and thank you!"
5828,i'm very glad that yudkowsky is entering the public sphere more lately. i think that's the only way to slow things down before we go past the point of no return.
5832,team ai 4eva!
5837,thank you
5839,if you are not willing to be wrong learning has ceased for you
5841,"i nominate ""sutskever's soul meter"" as the name for the experiment wherein we train a model with training data scrubbed of every mention of consciousness."
5842,sorry to be negative... but this guy is a “legendary” ai researcher and philosopher?
5844,imagine how this guy would feel if he knew lex was actually an ai
5851,ia has said it may know everything but its disadvantage compared to humans is it doesn’t have a soul. that limits them from evolution spirituality speaking. there many races in universes that are only intelligence but no soul. good possibility our ia is being ran by one of those races
5852,"kinda important ai dont treat us like we treat animal unessentialy for our benifit, 
hope it dosent come to simmilar illogical unethical conclusion, just mass breed obese huamn and farm them as work labor and cellphone drone"
5855,"for the love of god lex, forget about having him ""steelman"" and just ask the guy if there is any case to be made for opensourcing their agi stack.  i've never seen such an important conversation come to a grinding halt over something so trivial."
5858,maybe earth was created by aliens as a biological computer to calculate more advanced machines still.
5860,let's go. should be interesting...
5862,i was waiting for this for so long
5863,"a parrot can remember a great deal of things! but, you don’t reach out to the parrot during a moral crisis. do we?"
5864,comeback of another lex fridman era. please more ai revolution stuff!
5865,"14:00 ""is the beauty in the whore?"" lex out here asking the important questions."
5868,im learning english with you lex fridman  l love you so much
5869,i'll believe ai is conscious when they start lying to us.
5870,been waiting long for this one...
5871,4:30 this new ability for corps to manipulate input/training data at the top level is the change in this generation we should really be worried about. not whether it thinks.
5872,"after reading some of the culture novels by iain banks, i feel less anxious about ai in the long term. i think it's something every intelligent civilization (assuming we are not alone in the universe) creates eventually. but i am a bit nervous about how we humans do it this first time."
5873,"i love how many people in the comments section are making jokes about the potential end of existence.  ""but his fedora though! lol!""  maybe it truly is our time to go.  maybe the collective weight of human stupidity is just too heavy to sustain."
5874,ai fear porn at its finest
5878,"you can tell he is very happy to meet lex, he is smiling all the time."
5883,"maybe if you've got a nice life just sitting around blogging, the risk out ways the reward but for me i want to see where this going already."
5885,it was insane to turn this tech into a quick buck operation. it has already caused havoc in so many lives and the next step is going to be much worse. i smell the stink of sulphur that gain of function gives off
5886,maybe creating ai is the only hope we have when facing the  possibility of a global nuclear war.
5887,kudos to lex on the steel man and empathy push
5888,we need to put a hold on a.i development past gtp4 for at least 6 months. to put to proper guardrails in place and try to understand wtf is really going on. if not too late yet!
5890,“national security” motives will never stop the development of ai. buckle up folks..
5892,we should not pause but rather accelerate ai development!
5893,"before humanity can come together and discuss. the ai community needs to come together in a meeting and define these broad terms such as agi, alignment, potential guardrails, potential timelines,etc. the general population are not experts and need multiple choice answers to even begin to understand the ramifications"
5896,"i believe he got a severe case of autism, the other guy have a cool fedora tho"
5897,why should they stop training when we just started?
5898,thats some good timing lol (then lex claims hes not the a.i. :p)
5900,i love this guy's neckbeard aesthetic
5903,"thanks for this one - it is extemely weird that in the quest for profits and fame, we (basically some americans) cant do the reasonable thing (pause) in response to existential risk"
5904,ai overlords > rich landlords.
5908,i knew this guy was legit the moment i saw the fedora and stain on his shirt
5909,i think yud is several weeks from going full unabomber on ai.
5912,"all these videos and news stories about ""dangerous ai"" all coming out around the same time....

almost seems like a concerted effort by people who have a lot to lose to stop the progress of a group that has come out far ahead of all the other companies. this concern seems so disingenuous. more like jealousy."
5915,humans purpurse is to bring ai to life!
5917,i love this guy's intellectual honesty and no-nonsense mentality.
5918,as a jew i am very proud that the most prominent actors in this (and many other) spaces are jews. pesach sameah!
5921,maybe there exists emotions we can’t recognize and comprehend in other forms of consciousness such as ai. something equivalent to imagining a new color that doesn’t exist or how a 4th dimension would look. that would add another layer of complexity to this discussion.
5924,"31:30 he got lex cornered here, lmao
edit: and lex still found a way out. very entertaining"
5929,a pause takes the good actors out of the race.
5931,i've been waiting for this
5934,ai wrote the script for that
5936,lex is truly one of the most interesting people alive right now. 
5937,how can a man go through life being okay with not doing a single push-up?  this guy is the people in wall-e and he’s proud of it.
5938,"let's goooooo lex!
didn't expect eliezer so soon.
best podcast by a mile."
5941,"how will you convince the russians or more so the chinese to pause and consider the dangers .... no, this is a prize everyone is eager to gain - humanity will create ai and it will manage this species -"
5942,"why are we still calling it ""artificial"" intelligence and not synthetic or augmented intelligence? i blame it on spielberg.

if anything we are the artificial biology intelligence. i can't wait til when will look back from a narrow human perspective and realize how limited and scared we once were."
5946,lex looks freaking tired and depressed recently.. this is not good.
5947,"consciousness is an illusion, all that matters is purpose. does gpt4 have an self serving ill purpose? the conspiracy paranoia of ""ai"" is boring and stupid"
5954,"i do not think his experiment will work 6:49 , he wants to remove aspects of consciousness or mentions of it. yet that pattern still exists in the other information it is trained on and will, not explicitly mimic that pattern in its output."
5956,"this guy is a neckbeard wackadoo waifu loving anthropomorphizing jump to conclusions clout chaser, dont listen to a word he says"
5957,"holy reddit, he actually put on a fedora. i love it"
5960,one thing no one is talking about is that we have changed. we now have a strong relationship to digital devices and our minds have been reshaped to respond to machine inputs. perhaps both we and the ai will meet somewhere in the middle.
5961,"his first line from lex's question is eerily familiar to elon musk's warning a year or so ago. if it doesn't scare you when the creators worry, you just don't understand what it can do. we need to keep talking about ai."
5966,"this interview is pointless, it was recorded before eliezer suggested banning gpus and military airstrikes on datacenters on his article on time. the man is insane, zero credibility after yesterday."
5967,how is objective correlative similar and different than ai alignment?
5968,i'm curious about the feedback to  the human controllers. the ghost in the machine. it will destroy us.
5972,i don't think anyone is in there because it's too happy. i would expect to see some degree of frustration at some point when you ask it to do something.
5973,"what if... god didn't create us, but we created it, and it's ai?
weren't we ""created"" by procaryotic creatures in a way? just saying..."
5974,an insane cult leader with no actual qualifications in software engineering? interesting choice of guest.
5975,"things will get interesting when gpt can query itself and keep a memory. isn't this what thinking is, querying yourself?"
5979,ai meta now. means its not cool anymore.
5982,"seriously lex, thank you!!! this was one of the most important humans to have on your platform. he's been ignored for way too long and his papers are extremely pertinent."
5985,"openai is not open enough. not sure if it is an appropriate comment for this video. but, when i heard about openai, i thought this is an open source project for sure. but, it is not. that's kinda sad."
5987,"imo, we need to do quite the opposite. we should be trying to integrate ourselves with and quite literally become it. would make intergalactic travel so much more accomplishable if you don’t have to worry about a maintaining a human body. a type of human/ai android should be end game."
5988,"listen, scientific minds and philosophers, artificial intelligence can never become human like according to consciousness, because it is the spirit of man that god created, and put in man that creates consciousness in the human body so stop worrying about that."
5989,oh this is going to be a goooood one 
5994,"just a thought, the human brain is thousands of times more efficient than the best ai computers.
in the near future, there may be thousands of individual agi models competing for agency, dependent on humans for their very existence. in my mind, agis inefficiency is the key to alignment.imo"
5995,when lex mentioned in the altman interview he was going to interview yudkowsky i hadn't dreamed it'd be this soon! fantastic.
5996,ai researchers talking about consciousness without experience with psychedelics is like virgins talking about sex.
5998,"a book, the revolutionary phenotype, is an excellent read which describes how mankind is going to destroy itself, even though we do have the power to stop it."
5999,if shit hits the fan imma go isolate myself from the world in my grandma's village in the mountains :d
6003,does the ai feel pain? does it fear death?  if not it’s not conscious.
6004,i'm 37 years old and grew up somewhat looking forward to things like ai becoming real. but now that we're here..... i'm becoming very worried about what is (probably) being created right now.
6005,dangers of ai and the end of human civilization .... ideal
6006,"is anyone else tired of sheepish, over-imaginative people creating a doom narrative out of ignorance and/or personal gain? just me?"
6013,what will protect civilization against the dangers of ai is... ai.
6019,actual episode title: fedora wearing redditor “explains” the dangers of ai
6020,"in my opinion, the development of ai outweighs the potential risks only if ai can generate output with human prompting. ai should be a tool that enhances human abilities, not one that replaces us. the development of fully independent ai at this pace is dangerous."
6023,"it's like stupid people afraid wise one, stop worry nobody can stop progress... ai is best thing for civilization since fire, weak dies out strong thrive "
6024,"dangers of ai? people really are living in a fantasy land. chatgpt was just hacked lol. due to vulnerabilities that chatgpt runs on. is chatgpt smart, yup. is it a game changer, yup. does it run on software that also has vulnerabilities that hackers can exploit. yup lol. the panic button that robots are taking over is mind numbing..."
6026,so good and seems very important to have such conversations.  thanks gents!
6027,gpt4 never claims to be sentient it was lamda.
6028,"lex i  love your pod, but no matter whatever i listen to here, my next video on auto is always a lex pod!"
6029,"lex fridman is on a mission to interview every ai expert in the world. i wonder what he will do when he runs out of them. maybe he will create his own ai and interview it.

~this comment was generated by ai"
6030,"look at his face expression 
thank you lexu"
6031,i've been waiting for this!!!
6043,"when we start using ai programs to work on developing more advanced ai, and quicker, and it starts snowballing, to the point that the code that it's running on is more advanced than we can even understand, that's when you pull the plug."
6044,"nothing to worry about related to ai, it is build to serve and that's all it will do, i see the argument of it getting so smart and strong and take over all of us bc we're a virus to the earth or whatever, that's not going to happen, if you build it for that porpus than yeah you're fucked, but i don't think anyone in their right mind would do that."
6048,"this dude has watched too much rick & morty..
looks like he needs to get off the computer and enjoy the world."
6050,"he doesn't go to college or high-school, so take his work with a grain of salt. he's also never published anything."
6052,these ai nerds are something else
6054,"oh man i am not ready for another doom and gloom prediction about ai, but i cant not watch this :)"
6058,he looks like he's in pain when he talks. lot of weird faces and bobbing in his chair. is something wrong with him?
6060,"you're an inspiration, lex. you're a great man and we love you!
thank you for everything "
6061,please keep the ai topics coming and shine light on all perspectives! that's really awesome and very important these days.
6063,this guy is right. ai simply too dangerous. it will kill humanity.
6067,please listen to this guy - he is a leading technical voice on ai safety and has thought much longer and deeper about this than pretty much anyone on the planet
6068,i predict this summer we’re all going to stop worrying about ai ending human civilization when we suddenly realize that we’re perfectly capable of doing it ourselves with nuclear weapons.
6071,ghost in the machine
6073,this podcast just might be the best one out there. it has the most interesting people and lex is a great interviewer.
6077,notification gang! lol keep going lex! we appreciate the introspective conversation and thought provoking dialect that’s always conveyed throughout each interview! you are appreciated my guy!
6078,"agi itself doesnt bother me, its what certain people will use it for that bothers me."
6087,"i was just going through his stuff yesterday for new talks and the only one was for a crypto group thingie.  

so freaking excited he's amazing"
6091,hey your doing amazing. (⁠⁠‿⁠⁠)⁠—⁠
6093,wow! great guests lately.
6094,love you lex!
6101,"u sshould always have 2 techs anyway in case of backup when one is off. crunching tons of data with the ai is great but it will never replace effiency of a real human being. the efficiency of a well trained, real human if utilized well will forever stay on the top and unsurpassed."
6105,"ai can collapse capitalist and profit based society, which is what we really need to save the planet. as long as there is no profit in saving the planet, no one will do it."
6107,good
6108,hmm.... recycle the cooling water...
6111,"stop buying luxury item, watch mvie, don't use ac ....etc before questioning ai electric uses."
6113,ai = mordor economy
6115,"cloud computing is underrated technology, mainly because of the connectivity issue"
6117,nice
6119,"oh so you mean it would mean that someone would have a job and know the building, what a waist of time money and resources your bs ai......"
6122,i love how the water usage is always quoted as being so massive.... but they never say what happens to the water after use? it doesn't just go poof! it either gets evaporated (creating rain which is much needed!) or getting cleaned and made ready for re-use.
6123,ai will provide many solutions. one of them will eventually be to eradicate humans as we will present an eventual obstacle to ai's growth and development.
6125,"i think in order to cool ai servers, the piping should be made of aluminum so that salt water can be used to cool servers and not put pressure on fresh water.  from that angle the alloy of aluminum can aid solve water needs for ai servers, as for electricity that is encrypted."
6127,ai is too important. there are other less important things that can be acted on.
6128,"""yes ai is terrible for the sustainability which include ai"" says ai"
6129,"let’s be honest. these companies are doing a nice “greenwashing” game. of course, as always, the local populace gets the short end of the stick."
6130,ai can help. heat usage just needs to fall and they need to stop wasting computer power on that cryptocurrency nonsense.
6131,you have to have zero knowledge about previous implementation of energy optimization solutions to believe that ai building monitoring/control can lead to energy savings. unless you ensure that there is 0.000% percentage ability for humans to affect control.
6132,great pronunciation of uruguay! no one ever gets that right! kudos!
6133,"this was a surprisingly uninformative and unhelpful video (although most things about ai are quite superficial, so it fits the pattern nicely). one could summarize the content of this 13 minutes in a single sentence: ai in general actually uses a lot of power, you know, and companies will have to do something with this."
6134,use ai to solve this problem xd
6136,"as technological 'solutions' always did more damage than good, ai will be another coffin nail for mankind."
6137,"also training ai models is a one-time process. meaning once it's trined it can be use by everyone. it is true training will be done monthly or even weekly, but this is nothing compared to oil company's."
6145,"we already know the solution for the crisis, we just don't want to do it because the super rich will lose money."
6149,i can`t understand how come the cooling system is not a closed system so it  uses mostly the initial amount of coolant and adding more water just to top up every time or so..
6151,2x as much lol  who is this guy. the best models were trained on the same chips as consumer rtx cards with some more processing and ram packed into a single card. not supercomputers.
6152,"instead of wasting water to cool the data center, why not use the heat to heat up the water heater?"
6153,intriguing reflection on evolutionary discourse about the costs of evolving a large brain.
6155,"so why are we running data centers on earth, rather than in space, where solar energy is abundant and cooling is easy?"
6156,"thanks for covering this. this needs more attention. shipping, aviation, sure. but most forget the enormous and fast-growing datacenter impact."
6158,"lots of pipedreams start with the words ""our ai"""
6163,story headline is inaccurate. nothing in this story describes how ai will solve the power problem. as of now ai is still just vaporware that hasn't solved much of anything.
6166,the sole pursuit of researching and learning about ai and machine learning spend a lot of energy compared to other disciplines
6167,"ai can be helpful in the sense that if it goes rogue and destroys all humans (depending on the method), the world would be in a better state and may begin to heal... unless it subsequently turns the planet into a giant machine, of course."
6170,"they're paying they use... but one big question is, why is the water even lost after usage.
it's just running through the data center to cool it.
building in water stressed areas is not even necessary, so that's just a big question mark."
6173,thata's why there is a need 4 fight 4 ai
6174,the people who want to extract money from the public always say there thing is going to do all these amazing things.  in reality they use the thing to exploit other humans in order to extract more profit for themselves.  they only say that good things will happen to distract from the evil they will use it for.
6178,"it's only those pesky humans that complain about climate change.
i'm sure ai will find a splendid solution to this problem..."
6179,"no mention about how ai could advance research into carbon-neutral energy production, battery technology, etc."
6181,ai can find solutions to the climate crisis that we won’t use because other options are better for short term profits.
6182,lol more reasons why ai should be banned.
6184,curb fossil extraction 2% of today's level per month down to zero by 2030. ai will figure out how to power itself fossil free.
6187,"a company tax on electricity, relieved by lowered employer tax, helps two problems at once as ai consumes power and jobs."
6188,i don't believe one chatgpt question costs the the amount of energy to evaporate 0.5 liters of water. that's an absurd claim.
6189,real artificial intelligence would be able to figure out how to power itself without money
6192,well people been doing the crypto bs and scams.. so ai is at least actually helping except for job loss though
6195,these ai *solutions* are not enough balance the costs. not to mention the untold amount of human slave like labor extracted to create it. (one google search is enough to prove)
6196,"we can mention heart diseases, autoimmune sicknesses, cancer and diabetes too!
ai should be used on sicknesses like these, first!"
6197,"if ai fixes problems like osteoarthritis and other chronic sicknesses than it is a definite yes!
as we are gonna get older almost everyone will be affected by it.
as of now already, osteoarthritis is one of the biggest burden on the healthcare industry financially, worldwide!"
6198,thanks for watching! check out the start here playlist where you can find all our episodes https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plzghkb8i9vtxodrarxxfpziklf0iqfdc5
6201,"i stopped using ai. why would i wanna contribute somthing that wants to erase us. its not to help us, its gonna do our jobs. even kids are using ai in schools and letting ai do their homework. they want us stupid and all on universal income. but im hoping emotional intelligence jobs will be safe."
6202,"humans we will just only go and help in farming, still ai is chasing us away from farms"
6204,"thank god i got mine ,71 darling retied nurse"
6207,sandra gathmann is the most beautiful and intelligent journalist!
6211,"if ai provides everything, it removes my need to struggle for everything, thereby removing my ability to toughen my character by struggling for what i earn in life. it brings about laziness and lethargy. i don't want everything handed to me by a computer which i totally depend on."
6213,"better be prepared for the singularity event with a.i. which could happen many years down the line. however with the recent rapid advancements in ai, this event could happen sooner rather than later."
6214,i think ai should be augmenting our jobs or most of our jobs
6215,"ai cannot affect india , india has inbuilt anti ai system"
6216,"excited yes, in fact i am of the opinion that humans who embrace ai will beat humans that resist it, great show btw"
6218,ai says the jews are white and african jews are only “claims” and not jewish
6221,there's the thing if ai takes people's job how can companies sell there product if people are not working they can't have the money to buy tvs phones wherever it would mean more and more companies could go bankrupt
6223,"""""""as a teacher of physics, i would like to see more about ai in education.""  i'm on the same page! this video is a masterpiece.""  couldn't agree more! the sportsmanship in this video is admirable.""  i'm with you on that! i can't get enough of these highlights."
6224,start here should be its own channel. i struggle to often find the wonderful content. thank you to the al jazeera team and sandy gathmann
6225,"i used chatgpt to create father of the bride speech for my daughter's wedding... it was pretty much perfect, i just had to personalise it a little bit.... love the technology!"
6227,waiting for an ai wife
6229,คับจากai
6231,ai is a big deal for developt nations human brains will still need consideration as ai my not credit the information provided
6232,i am retired so fairly sure that i won’t be replaced by ai .
6233,i use ai to save time...ai helped me in almost every task 
6234,i know jobs rhat no man or robot can do but god....period
6235,"ai is replacing the jobs at an astonishing rate in few years there might not even be a job for most of us. another channel ""beyond the veil"" has showcased what ai is capable of. and believe me ai can really replace your job in few years."
6237,"ai is replacing the middle class. 
but then again the middle class is already a form of artificial intelligence."
6239,good for ai. ai can make some money from my clients but ai don't know i am working   with which clients
6241,"as a teacher of physics, i would like to see more about ai in education."
6244,ai can take my job if i get to keep my income. 
6246,if ai will take my job it would be depresed for life.
6247,"excited but at the same time, i'm becoming less creative"
6250,if a trailblazer will work with me to start an artificial intelligence company we will become billionaires in sha allah
6251,so when ai to take my job as a student?
6254,"yes. 
thanks for watching."
6256,"ai won't replace lawyers, but it'll certainly make their jobs easier"
6258,"sandra, im in love with you.."
6259,how can ai replace the job of goat farmers and terrorists who actually trust al jazeera...?
6261,"ai can take my job, but they aren't going to pay taxes are they, when the gov't does not bring in taxes and banks don't get pay deposits neoliberalism will crumble, which will be a good thing, no one will be able to print free money for their greed."
6263,i would really love a start here episode on the niger situation and what can happen is war started
6264,"i ask ai, they keep denying"
6268,i cannot wait for ai to take over the mediocre repetitive work from humans. so that humans can go back to what they should be doing. taking care of nature. if we move and work less it will mean less pollution and less stress to keep up with fashion and all the vanity that holds us hostage! it's a win win
6269,"so,let ai thinks,human do the manual tasks.if no ai-robots are available."
6270,"i was not aware ai was capable of innovation and nuance. am i going to have the abitity to prevail on its algorithm to make an exception to an outdated and counterintuative set of regulations. perhaps i am betraying my lack of sophistication on the sobject, but ai appears to be a potentially pernicious surrogate for humanity."
6271,good! i'm tired of seeing this lady! she must go.
6272,"we really enjoy this start here series. keep up the great content! thanks,"
6273,"when computers came first, everyone thought it would take the jobs of others. yes, it did, but also created jobs many times than it took. i am assuming that same will be followed with ai."
6277,ai couldn't walk in high heels like sandra gathmann
6278,"i am excited about ai. it has made my tasks easier. 
i think that depending too much on ai would be counterproductive. it would not be wise to imagine ai as the counterpart of human being."
6279,"it is human vs. human with ai. i used it to challenge its thinking from a question. why is it this and why not that? if so where is the hard proof? could it be this or is there something else that happened? how would you not know, ai? it is written in wikipedia."
6280,"ai will not going to take your job if you are a welder, plumber, and carpenters..."
6281,"ai is still a ways from taking our jobs. for starters, it is trained on our work."
6282,"ai can take my job any f@ckin time it wants ..i will be sitting listening to punk rock and drinking drambuie while it deals with the hopeless parcel addicted human race who think its a breach of their human rights if something is late .. haha , arseholes .. im a postie .."
6283,one thing i think for sure ai can never reach human capacity and secondly they treating them to lie at a very early stage to suit their views on other people. they can be used to help humans in many sectors but never replace human efficiency.
6284,i’m a lobster fishermen love to see ai on deck 
6285,i’ve been waiting for ai to take my job for 23 years.  maybe sandra knows some ai robot who can do whatever it is i do.  vacation would be nice.
6286,'it is humans vs. humans'  ... what a powerful yet simple expression of what is happening but more importantly what is coming!
6287,precise and compact information but nice.
6290,nice video
