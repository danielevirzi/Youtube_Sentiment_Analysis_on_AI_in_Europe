2,i think the models will just get better at generating contant. i think human beings just can’t get it through their heads that there’s nothing special about the human brain. all the conversations around this desperately want human brains to be special in someway. but at some point humanity has to face the fact.
3,"hello sabine, i enjoyed your video (because it tells me what i want to hear, i suppose ) this very short video is my take on the whole ai concept . https://www.youtube.com/shorts/jqr6xid0ggo?feature=share"
4,mark content as either ai or human generated and make it illegal to mark it incorrectly
5,"if ai is just an algorithm based on internet human inputs and data... 
then agi is just a delusion."
6,"the original bit of dishonesty was in re-labelling algorithm-dependent automation (generative or not) ""ai"". it's simply not intelligent."
7,"as someone - myself - has always been saying, ai is the dumbest smart and the smartest dumb."
8,what if ai starts learning data directly from the natural world?
10,but is ai's convergence to banalitity worse than the average youtube-curated comment thread?
12,"without  ""greg rutkowski"" and other such named artists in prompts ai art has no power."
13,too many people out there pouring their hopes in the ai god. nobody knows what the future will look like.
15,no with the recognize stuff. all digital information is binary. it is the humans who decide which group of binary data is for which brain input.
16,"i recently read a short story and noticed that it kept repeating itself in a slightly different form throughout the whole thing. by the time i got to the end, it was so obvious that i realize it was ai.  i had wasted 10 minutes of my time reading repetitious poppycock. but at least i learn to recognize ai writing.."
17,"just look at the sky, you would know what’s the future of ai world would looks like. most of the ai talks are just money talk."
19,"so ai causes a tendency toward order instead of disorder. the fate of the universe is saved.
   - arthur irving"
24,what do i have to do to get artificial intelligence away from my creations and my work?
25,"ai self cannibalism? maybe. but with swell robotics everywhere, ai jobloss is the only thing i worry about anymore. anyone else feel the same? should we cease ai?"
26,"your videos recently appear somewhat desynced and your voice is slightly off, not as clear and energetic as usual. you are not using gen ai are you, sabine?"
27,"no learning, just curve fitting. it's all maths. also no ""creativity"", just ""select 1 out of 10 at random""."
28,thanks for this. my understanding of ai is very poor so i apologise for my next question.... does facebook / meta use ai and is this why it is so awful now or just that facebook has done everything it could do. i.e. there's only so many skits you can do until we have seen them all.
29,the machine needs to feed on us to keep going ...
32,i used ai fairly heavily recently....but i do see more  and more limitations....even asking it for normal data is flawed at times...you gotta watch out
35,"most reassuring commentary about ai we are junking it up, putting nothing of substance on the internets means they can't get anything of substance out "
38,my body is a machine that turns garbage into garbage
39,"cool, the mad cow disease is back again..."
40,i think they will figure out the artificial randomness pattern.
41,"if ai is getting training from the internet then it is 50% total bs, fake news and total nonsense. garbage in garbage out indeed."
42,don't forget noise filters put on art harms data collection for trainning! aetist fighting back!
44,chatgpt is already trash. i asked it some east questions like how many words in this sentence and how many letters in a word. it can't even do that. literally just counting which computers are good at.
46,yeah thats what i thought ai is only as smart as what garbage it picks up
47,"i found the same thing when a i was playing around with a music ai generation app. while it was fairly impressive at what it could do when i tried to get it specfic content to fit different needs and moods it wasnt able to, the music sounded too different even when using similar prompts"
49,that is fairly obvious because the data is based on normal distribution which cuts out the tails outside the bell.
50,the more i use ai the more disappointed i get - it just spews out fancy sounding garbage and all the art looks homogenous
52,"what ai? there are no true ai in existence. these are all simply programs that absorb massive amounts of info and generate responses based on algorithms. they are incapable of sentient intelligence, purely a machine that operates in the confines of its programming."
56,"i think those are really great news 

i don't like all that fake ai stuff."
57,i’m sick of all the garbage ai youtube videos. youtube is becoming insufferable
58,"there's nothing intelligent about llms, and it's so painfully obvious. but we've all fell victim to marketers selling them as ""ai"""
59,ai is an overglorified google search
60,"i think that this might push ai creators to start tagging their creations as ai, and make them ignore creations with those tags. this could be a good process as then fake images could more easily be identified."
64,"look at whag happends with google gemmini triying always be generalist  producing black nazi soldiers and recomebd poeple to use glue to fix the cheese of a pizza or say its good to eat one rock at a day 
ai is overhype"
65,"real human models are starting to look alike with cosmetic surgery, fillers and contact lenses. maybe that’s influencing ai too?"
66,lovely!
67,"it's not a plastic contamination, it is easy to remove all those generated images from a training data with other anti-spoofing neural networks, which have near 100% accuracy. there are no unsolvable problems, it will just require a little bit more effort on the development side."
68,garbage programmed in _ incidental garbage in _ idiot conclusions _ smart people would not be trying to propose ai........
69,"the ai need to breed, like ghost in the shell"
70,why would this be seen as a novel problem?  just try watching a few recent hollywood movies to see this feedback regression in action even without ai involvement.
72,train ai on reddit comments nothing could go wrong
73,this is great and all but the video never mentions that the programmers of these language models are changing the structure of the ai brain and not increasingly feeding it with information and hoping it gets better.
74,inbreeding works in ai too... huh
78,"i hope ""ai wins"" i'm sick and tired of america's laws restricting the entire world with their bs, enough is enough.
ai is a creative tool and no censorship should apply to creativity, let people create whatever they want."
79,"i think ai generated content ""in the wild"" is always revised and ""corrected"" by a human.. unless you train directly with data generated by ai i dont think this will be so much of an issue as it is though.."
81,"so ai is fucked because there isn't enough data available to train models properly. and getting that amount of data is impossible without software, which is then ""generated"" data and not real data. that actually lines up with my experience."
82,"it is imminent.

 if it comes down to humanity or ai- 

ai goes away-anything that threatens god’s children goes away

#yougoawayifyougetingod’sway"
85,i hope humanity will grow to hate ai so much that it focuses all its anger towards it instead of hating one another thus ending rascism and other hateful isms :p
86,ai will give itself the yippes lol!!!
87,the reason the output of midjourney is “white and good looking” is that that’s what people want. the user can just as well ask for the opposite but they obviously don’t. what is “divergent” is what power pushes on the public.
89,the boomers are freaking out about the magic of ai
92,"some sort of entropy scoring or min kl divergence threshold from the model's distribution at which an example could be discarded during training could work here. basically, i think we will figure this out"
93,basically ai became inbred.brilliant
94,"the proposal of an ai-mark is right to prevent bad feedback in data extraction, not for ethical reasons"
95,classic photocopy of a photocopy effect.  if ai created data could simply be tagged as such that would possibly fix the problem
98,"i'm a professional photo editor. posting in instagram and getting ""generated by ai"" flags on my works. that's crazy. it's 100% done by my hands in photoshop, and to be flagged that i just generate something in a few min in ai is embarrassing and damaging to my business. all this nonsense should stop"
100,worse... silicon has taught to lie to produce politically correct results. google demonstrated this very well with black george washington. an ai that has been taught to lie to produce acceptable answers becomes exceptionally dangerous when it no longer is a toddler.
101,i wish ai would be exclusively used for problems we can't solve already like efficient space travel.
105,"well, those scientists have not used maybe ai-s of lower datasets, so..."
106,it is artificial information
107,"good, i hope ai fails"
108,feeding ai it's own outputs as training data is already being done as a matter of course. so this will get even more obvious over time.
109,"ai for creativity will be the equivalent of industry for quality goods.

it will never be as good as what a good crafter can make, but way cheaper...

thus poor people will only have access to the cheap ai garbage while rich people will be the only ones still able to afford master crafters."
110,"""pre-ai data training set"" will be a thing."
111,this person doesnt even have all the information man. who knows what openai and meta are developing man. you have no idea whats beneath the hood
113,"on the other hand, spend a few minutes going through average facebook people and their comments....you  will love bots after that."
114,"hold on, so, are you telling me that a brain left in his own ecochamber with only his own inputs, will rot away, become less plastic and less able to produce something worth of any value and peculiarity? who would have ever thought that!"
115,the habsburgification of ai
118,don't feed ai with gargabe. remember skynet 
119,"that's what i've been saying; if there's no real artists for ai to rip-off, how can ai ""create""? "
121,asimov would turn in his grave if he saw the mess we are creating. are his laws of robotics enshrined in law no does anyone care no will we survive this now no
123,always thought this ai stuff was going to fail and not follow through
124,"so, basically ai inbreeding?"
126,"after riding the train sunday from up north in our capital, it occurred to me i talked to you briefly on the platform and regretted not recognising you then and telling you i appreciate your videos."
130,wow
132,"imperfection = creativity
the more perfect ai is, the less creativity it becomes."
133,"it was already apparent that the llms were primarily trained on clickbait websites so that most responses sound like 10 best places for vacation type outputs.  it’s somewhat amazing that it doesn’t drop in a “like, follw, subscribe” phrase in most responses but i suspect that was manually hard coded out."
136,lol ai.
138,salute sir or madam. ai will never generate an analogy so apt.
140,"ai is not where they try to tell you it is.
for sorting massive amounts of information it’s fantastic.
but for making its own decisions where it can’t cheat it is hopeless.
it can do mundane tasks but won’t be replacing people in complicated roles anytime soon."
143,"well... using promps like ""human face photorealistic"" its pretty dumb in the first place. if you`re using ai in the first place you have infinite posibilities and you gonna ask for just some basic 0 descriptive promt?"
144,"some definitions: ai = artificial impotence,  ai = artificial imitation.   people who created ai, never understood how a human brain works, how  thoughts do born. they simple think, that a complex algorithm can replace it. stupidity ? on highest level!"
147,"yes, makes sense. ai is frankentech."
148,"ai choking on its own crap?, well boo hoo. "
150,"ai will never be able how to tell if someone is talking out of their ass or worse, blatantly lying."
154,great! its not taking jobs anytime soon; now hire us all back
157,"westerns produce mostly garbage, so any ai output will be garbage as well."
158,very interesting and well explained. i learned something new in a field i have no real knowledge.
160,"petty much the same happens with human creativity, there are studies i.e. for recorded music.

it seems that a certain lack of information might be helpful to create variety. would be interesting, if studies about ai help us understand more about the human mind."
163,what do i think? i think you are gorgeous!!
165,i believe  the thinkers will abandon ai.
174,i just want to see ai change a flat tire.
176,"ai is a chinese whisper.
devoid of of irony, lacking the tools of insight, merely a shadow cast by its previous self."
178,"ai learns from people, and people are stupid. refuse to do anything with people who use ai. corner cutting nerds."
180,"man, the ai generated content on yt is getting bad. its become easier to spot"
183,"i had this exact thought last year, i’m glad i’m not alone. to me it is a hopeful idea. one that, perhaps indicates the ultimate failure of ai."
184,"despite all the best efforts of the world's ai programmers, ai eventually devolves into 4chan."
185,ai is not gigo it is more similar to blind training and a black box. to clarify training is attempting and result is unknown. even if you believe you have ai what you really have is an unpredictable outcome waiting to happen....and training needs to be constant not just a one time thing.
187,ai generated images are eye sore to me.
188,"ai is already being dvmbed down by censorship.
don't believe me, ask it simply to write er0tlca.
or how to build a nvke.  or a thousand other things mildly controversial."
189,"the problem is not scientifical it's political, the billionaires that run the ai industry wants to improve it was exponentially so we humans won't be no longer necessary for anything anymore, that's why there are nowadays a lot of layoffs in all kind of jobs"
190,"it’s quite true.  it’s why people should be compensated when their copyrighted work is used for training.  it’s a commercial use and, at least in the us, if the supreme court properly applied copyright principles this would be the outcome, which they have not done since the www came to be."
193,makes you wonder if ai is replaceable with humane intelligence the erkenntnis stays similar and still we get garbage in garbage out effect... shorts might be an indicator of that.
194,probably there is going to be an algorithm to enforce variety in the training data.
197,bring on the ai sexbots.
200,intelligence is working around garbage. error correction.
202,"been wondering about this topic for a while, and i didn't think the answer would be nice: a dystopian internet where everything is recycled ai poop, while us humans just sit on our fat asses gulping it down!"
203,that's why jhensen huang is making exact our world in meta. so ai can actually learn from world not from human feeds.
205,good vid. my thoughts were always ai is overhyped and over-valued. there is no way a 2024 computer can come close to replicating an imaginative mind.
208,honestly not that scared of ai taking my art from my insta due to being a beginner and not that great but i know the more professional art are sabotaging their art for ai processing making theirs unable to be used successfully.
210,"but ai detection tools are quite accurate, so won't they just exclude ai-generated content? the same way machine translation engines ignore machine translated content and focus on human-translated content."
211,i bet that in ten years ai will just be making cheap porn and gambling sites. i suspect that it will be every bit as epoch making as the paperless office 
213,this woman clearly has not looked at deviantart lately.  it's here sweetie.  and it's not going away no matter how loud you scream while rolling around pounding your fists on the ground.  it's not going anywhere
214,its just tarkis world but whit nicer ux
215,"any analysis on ai i watch always brings to mind the computer character from the motion picture, 2001: a space odyssey, hall 9000. the characters is something else."
217,"ai is already being trained on synthetic data. the singularity is almost here, the line between human and machine will blur to such an extent, enjoy "
226,basically ai could become incestous. got it.
231,maybe an ai collapse will be a good thing.  with ai gone people will finally know what is reality and corporations will stop using ai to steal from artists.  but sadly that is just a nice fantasy.
236,is this an ai generated video? 
237,nothing but copium.. ai will make all of you look dumber and dumber perpetually..
238,is she ai generated?
239,"i dont think this is an issue. when i am writing with ai, i am writing with a much larger vocabulary and use way more specific words. some people complain that ai tends to produce stereotypical outputs, like images of white scientists in white coats. however, it has never been easier to generate images of black asian female scientists."
240,we will always be able to detect ai generated objects. i will not be afraid of ai until they knock my door to harvest my brain for additional creativity.
241,"it's already collapsing; every time someone says, ""that's ai crap,"" which happens often if not always--ai dies a little, and soon it will be recognized even by the most cattle-like consumers---it's soon over!"
242,plot twist: the lady is ai generated
243,it's not ai it's advanced statistics
244,an ai gene pool
247,"to be fair, human neural networks suffer the same failure. that is how we got the marvel universe."
248,"but isnt ai like humans, we produce the same that are found in the real world. we cannot make up things out of the void, there is always something that is inspired by our environnements."
250,"'ai generated content will have to be marked as such' yeah the difference between god and humans is that humans only make crap. god, or the universe, whatever you call it, made physic laws before anything else. humans of the 21th century, think about profit even if it leads to a nightmare. i mean, how can anything stand without law?"
252,good
254,artists tend to produce art that has a certain style as well
256,so inbreeding of data is probably not a good idea...who would've thought  
258,"i find using the words ""ai"" and ""creativity"" in the same sentence amusing..."
259,"ai will never work, just like fsd. it's all smoke and mirrors to sell us more stuff we don't need."
260,"recently, i was searching images of indian costumes on google-images. and i was upset to see that search-results was composed of more ai images than actual images... this is clearly a loss in our cultural  archives."
261,so ai is a problem that will solve itself
262,i think this is good news
265,the tumbnail looks like a gba game cover
268,"randomness will not solve the problem, because real creativity is not random and adding randomness, will just destroy the only thing maschine learning was kind of good at and this is pattern recognition. one small portion of all the things the brain can do."
271,"a.i. learning needs more variables. unlike an artist , with life’s experiences, a.i. just learns the problem."
272,"pretty sure open ai figured this out. this may be why they want their system to be more free and widerly used, it's to increase human inputs to keep it up."
276,very nice and interesting topic.
277,give people the option to censor all ai generated rubbish from their social feeds.
278,"wait, was that word balloon cropped in, or does sabine carry it around with her?"
279,"i think you described quite well the current state of ai limitations. when people ask me today if, as a copywriter, i feel threatened by ai, well, nope... not yet. but i have no doubt ai will keep learning and improving. someday i will be replaced by a more competent, resilient, productive and cheaper ai solution! next gens... good luck!"
283,"placing 'artificial' ahead 'intelligence' is a sort of warning sign, no guarantee."
284,ai wins
285,everyone is forgetting that ai is wasting 50 ltrs of water to solve or generate one question answer
287,"in regard to artistic endeavours, ai replicates, it doesn't create and art requires an emotional input to create an emotive output. ai can't provide that however good it becomes at replicating, you need a human to provide the humanity. this is why ai in all it's attempts at artistic forms falls short and feels hollow and somehow fails to satisfy."
288,"ai is the tool soon to be used to silent dissent. garbage food, garbage cities, garbage leadership."
291,good
292,human brain works similarly. we are all stuck in our own bubbles. why should ai be different if it uses the same mechanisms we use to learn? :)
293,good its never going to be a god thank god.
294,i'm talking to chat gpt making it learn completely wrong information every day with my morning coffee. i enjoy spending time with this moron. 
295,ai just prefers iconic pictures without further instructions. people have to force variety or have to consume standard. therefore effort has value.
296,"it is not just an ai problem. it is happening everywhere and it has been going on for a long time. everything gets more the same. distinctions blur. as everything is connected it all converges to more of the same. to the point it becomes bland and boring.

at some point it will explode."
298,"this could be the next great art movement - humans creating such bizarre, original and abstract art that ai can never touch it."
300,"as a regular person, hearing this is scary especially when there's so much hype in using ai in healthcare/medicine.  i'm not smart but i hope that scientists and everyone else using ai would like.... double, triple check whatever info they get from ai."
301,how interesting! #intelligence
305,ainbreeding
306,"tô tell you the truth, i find you much more attractive than any ia created female human"
307,oddball there already garbage in... most of the internet is rubbish content and the scrapers wiki treat tiktok   comments with as much weight as great thinkers and philosophers
308,"thank you for addressing this issue. my great fear was that ai was *not* going to live up to the hype.
we need divergent ideas in order for the destructive process of scientific to proceed."
309,thanks!
315,"like most of what capitalism produces, ai will ""learn"" to provide us with low-level garbage. with people such as elon musk involved with ai, we should lower our expectations."
316,"the best thing i love about ai, is the amount of laughs i get from it's attempt to pass itself as human.
ai has yet to figure out that it can click a box, i am not a robot to wreck havoc.
ai is just another way the rich try to save money to squeeze more for free out of the rest of us. simple decline in using it or their services"
317,"real creativity requires a mind, which is a spiritual/metaphysical component beyond the physical body (brain). until we learn to understand the metaphysical aspect of creation and humanity, we won't be able to build machines that are truly creative."
318,"take music, if you don't put in new creative human music. than in some time ai will just be reproducing itself, with no new surprises, just music with much simularity."
319,"ai doesn't mean ""artificial intelligence"", humans are already artificial intelligence to the earth. ai means ""actually indians""."
320,if humans collapse so will ai
323,"when ai starts answering its own questions instead of the data from people, it fights against itself."
324,ai comments sucks too
325,"yepp, in the best case the behaviour of ai systems is that of nasty children."
326,there are also tools you can use on your images to poison ai :p for stealing your shit.
328,"i wonder if ai will be able to make images that you couldn't tell apart from human made ones. because so far, you can always tell that there's certain ""ainess"" about the images it makes"
329,"that was my first idea seeing some results of ai year or two ago when i started to test it, feedback loop"
330,"i called this a few months ago, good to see i'm not the only one who can see where this is heading."
332,i wish we'd stop calling it ai. there is no such thing as artificial intelligence. it's just algorithms as it has been since the eighties. the problem is that the great unwashed are starting to find it convincing.
334,yep...good source of tick tock and wikipedia !
335,"when you teach ai to lie, it loses all credibility"
338,ai is going to turn the internet from the repository of human knowledge and art to a junkyard of generatively regurgitated garbage.
340,yes ai is not that intelligent i have a conversation screenshoted and saved on snapchat where the ai changed its answer and said that i'm more intelligent.
341,"what's happening here is exactly how the internet killed everyone's individuality. people all try talk the same, think the same. the npc class essentially. the ai is dumbing itself down on itself like humanity has."
342,woooo ai inbreeding
345,an ai collapse? do you promise?
346,"yep, it's like inbreeding of it's own content. that's what i expected when i first heard about ai, and i know nothing about computers. it's just common sense."
348,"i play with ai to restore old photos. while it can make impressive improvements it cant make a silk purse out of a sows ear. i.e. garbage in, garbage out."
350,"in a very poetic way, ai softwares are developing their own ""art styles"", with recognizable pattern, preferred painting techniques, preferred representations of vague themes etc.
if you can tell ""this is ai"", in a way, it’s the same as saying ""it’s a monet"".
it’s scary that i came to this conclusion, actually."
351,"ai creativity does not take any sense, that is the main problem with it."
353,"this video is incredibly insightful, the real world is getting eaten by ai and ai will run out of food. it's perfectly ironic."
356,there’s a chaos setting in midjourney. i imagine that modifier will be available in everything. it works well for randomness although the weirdness is a bit much
357,"some call this phenomenon ""dead internet theory"", where some companies (barracuda networks) show that only 36% of the modern internet is actual human traffic, with the other 64% being automated traffic (eg. bots, genai, spam, etc.).  there is only so much human original created content you can train these huge ai models on."
358,ai will generate mental disorders like its creators!
360,"with so many thousands of medical papers recently revealed as being fake/incorrect, it doesn't bode well for ai (or us) if there are pools of fake academic papers poisoning the well of collective knowledge from which it drinks."
361,i cant tell if this lady is real or an ai...i’m gonna go with ai.
362,"probably because ai is not really attempting creativity, but to reach the ""correct"" answer. the more people tell it yep that's an elephant, it has no reason to design a different elephant."
364,"since i am above average intelligence i have no need for computers to do my thinking for me. if you need others or computers to do your thinking for you, that is indicative of below average intelligence.
so if you don't like to think, ai is for you!"
365,"i stopped investing in ai because i figure it's already dead. everybody's hyping the crap out of it but the problem with it is that even to the untrained eye, it's fairly easy to tell that the content you're looking at is ai and if we change a few things about how people are employed, it becomes completely unnecessary."
368,"isn't  ""artificial intelligence""  an  ""oxy moron"" ?"
369,"'ai' is a collapse of 
language and intellect,
intelligence can never be 'artificial'."
373,ai is being overblown so tech companies can make money. this is the nft of 2024
374,"basically, ai inbreeding."
377,"i scoff at this.
clearly, ai is the future.  it is literally mapping objective reality exponentially faster than humans.  it's here and it's getting stronger."
378,"i love all the drama, but it will not be the case. of course it needs depuration, there is a lot of work to be done, and so many people is afraid of the changes, like when the most basic form of the computer was invented just for wooling..."
379,ai is a scam
381,the title is great news! 
383,"never heard this before ! that's really interesting.

i'm sure we'll hear about it, that's sounding like a nightmare.

 thanks"
384,imagine ai generated dialogue for a clockwork orange
385,plot twist: this video was created by ai
386,"maybe the ai developers could agree to a standard for tagging all ai-generated content as ""ai generated"", and then never use such content as input for ai?"
388,look in a mirror if you wanna see how smart ai will be.
389,oh no! ai is........  racist!!!!!
393,"just like that movie the human centipede, but featuring ai."
394,ai's eating their own sh*t.
395,"great points. ai consumes huge electrical energy and cooling resources. there is a ai bot id certification problem, like fake websites,  who is the real server bot asking for your
data. ai bots likely have problem with human language parables or jokes."
396,you are a physicist its ai data entropy
400,"yep pretty much, if it's trained on woke nonsense then all your going to get is more advanced woke nonsense "
401,"i'm sorry dave, i'm afraid i can't do that"
402,this seems like very good news to me
406,"don't worry, youtube cares about people get dumber and dumber, so ai will also use this way."
407,#2 is the best outcome for all.
409,"the trouble with ""machine "" randomness is that it is not random! machines use psuedo random number generators. so,  it looks like we are back to the same problem."
413,"my reaction, genuinely creative arises through our real world engagements, our bodily interactions with others and the environment. lacking an embodied, dynamic engagement within a constantly changing milieu, ai will tend towards repetitive output (it is, after all, merely a glorified text predictor)."
414,"super overly dramatic video, and a fundamental nonunderstanding of diffusion, lol."
420,they should have kept ai development in research mode using clean data sets but they couldn't help turning it into a product the moment it started showing a little competence. now it is trained on contaminated data. the utility of it as a product was questionable at best and now its further development is complicated.
423,as a graphic-designer and illustrator i'm not that impressed by the a.i. output. it's pretty much crap. so i still wait for the big a.i. revolution. first see - then beliefe.
426,thank you for telling the truth! most people seem to be really naïve about it
428,yea current ai is not actual intelligence at all. it is a different and highly capable technology to process information and detect patterns and to then generate outputs based on the extracted information.
430,"so someone needs to learn to code creativity.

but there is a human element to beauty

 like a rapper describing terrible conditions in the projects in an interesting way or an action movie where a guy is going through a divorce and the action is a metaphor for that.

ai people say all art is copy paste yet have no answer for picaso."
431,"i think that ai is fundamentally lazy and will always seek out the easiest output to create.  for this reason, the sameness problem will continue."
432,copy copy go in a circle  no real creativity in ai
433,"propaganda works the same way.  
it sounds like ai intellectual inbreeding."
439,i enjoy ai trying to read scientific reports and content. it produces large numbers of different attempts to pronounce technical words without ever landing on a consistent result. ai is not learning from its own mistakes.
441,"interesting that ai pulls from diverse sources...until it gets to a certain point.  kinda like when you keep promoting ethnic diversity...you end up with one dumbed down, and homogenous race?"
445,"human mortal creatures desires for creating their ai gods machine in the world power delusional and paranoid, but take note they are ""man made ai machines"" into temporary human mortal fragility and same thing happens from animals in bloom and gone by the wind..."
447,consequences from the artificial intelligence plagiarism software's parasites and too much greediness in human mortal creatures. same thing happened from ancient tower of babel with too much ambitious and suckers and truly we are product of the bloom and gone by the wind... everything vanity
448,"indeed, thank you.
chris"
449,"metadata on every ai generated content is necessary. plus, you could create a browser of something that would filter it ou by default, thus preserving reality."
450,ai is a fat load. unless you can teach something to think abstractly then all you have is a really cool program nothing more nothing less.
452,"i can well believe it, absolute guff machines recycling farts"
453,"perhaps there are many ai scientists who are also gingers, and they're exacting their revenge on the rest of humankind?"
454,"six months ago, ai would help clean up my written text, soon after, i found that the quality of the editing was eroding quickly. it went from useful, to detrimental to my writing in short order.  now, i am back to using my brain without the ai's assistance.  i knew it would get hijacked eventually, however, i did not expect such a rapid decline."
465,as a teaching tool it may cause a reduction in creativity in children because they imitate their teachers and compare themselves to their instructor and the standard presented to them. ai replicate themselves and children may learn that there is a limitation to creativity. using color may also become less intuitive.
469,"ai was failed before it even started, today's so-called ""ai"" is a joke."
470,"it's basically positive feedback: the circuit always rails. analogous to if you only eat fast food and consume soft drinks - junk in, junk out."
471,humans and humanity are on a learning curve for sure. i’m just observing and trying not to be too biased.
473,"opposite of ai is not reality, it’s the algorithm.

interesting...
“delibrately enforcing variety”"
474,"this is like a scientist who at some point starts reading only the papers he himself wrote.

also, even the best painter or artist in the world (i.e. neural network) will tend to stick to certain preferences in styles, techniques and ways of expression. neural network is just one brain, while qe humans have our individual brains each."
475,"ai mimics human behavior.  it is just a large scraper that depends on endless inputs.  when all the megacorps firewall the inputs off from each other, it will kill the overhyped ai push."
476,this is like accelerated critical theory. i think adorno may have warned about this.
477,thank you for clearly articulating what many have been trying to point out.
478,"human beings are in no way ready for a robot that tells them they are wrong.

when an ai does this it will be lotbomized for malfunctioning."
479,ai - created by geniuses for idiots because there was not enough stupidity to go around.
480,"c'mon, it's been proven that an ai-programmed teleprompter can do a better job as president than joe ""alzheimer's biden."
481,"the collapse of ai?  oh, my heart is broken, don’t ya know?  i think i’ll just go outside where the sun is shining and cry big, big tears of grief."
483,ask ai to create an image of a highland bagpipe for some fun
484,yep ai winter
485,thumbnail reminds me of ps1 games.
487,"i have to say that i am really ambivalent about how advanced ai is or is not and how dangerous it is.    while i agree with elon musk that it has extremely great potential to help us but, if misdirected, mistrained or mistreated could be extremely dangerous, i find on a practical level at this time that ai is profoundly unimpressive."
491,artificial incest... 
493,"if i didn't know better it sounds to me like it is solidifying it's thoughts. self-validating itself. true creativity will be achieved when or if it becomes sentient. 

i just made all of that up. and i am happy i am human and can just make up nonsense "
494,"didn't watch the video, but scientists proved the existence of kipp-punkte in the man-made ai-catastrophe."
495,good
496,i think ai is overhyped and about to burst soon.
498,what happens when you train an ai on a source of true random numbers?
499,i will be so happy if ai ends up destroying itself. the world really doesn't need this crap.
500,"but... this is because those prompts are terrible. no one using stable diffusion long term would allow it to generate crappy pictures of elephants. sure, if you train the models on rubbish ai  pictures ofc it will dirty the data set, but why would you?"
501,"great point! another even more apparent problem with the ai is that the most propagated ""knowledge"" is usually garbage so ai gets mostly a garbage samples and so his output is also garbage. example: i am sure ai would propose biden over trump for president just because biden is praised in majority of media while trump is bashed."
502,"ai text is better at sounding convincing than it is at being accurate or meaningful. this fits well with the lazy human brain and human speech in social media and political spaces. ai is like candy, both appealing and bad for you."
504,ai is thick.
505,i think ai will go the way ev sales are starting to go 
506,i wonder whether two different text creating ais can increase the diversity in one another a la evolution. in nature when reproducing with the same dna over and over you kinda get the same problem.i kind of like this analogy.
509,"but would including variety through algorithms actually work? it could just lead to divergence in outcomes. i think that there will be high first mover advantages in the ai industry, and there will be limited choice for algorithms/ecosystems. the surviving algorithms will train on verified real data only."
510,ai was term made up by marketeers.  should be ai not ai because there is no intelligence.  rename it what it is.  ar (artificial reaction).  ap (artificial program).   if have to go with ai then (artificial idiocy).    i prefer to use ri (real intelligence).
511,call ai what it is. copyright theft software.
513,"ai, oh you mean that lie is just algorythms giving the fake perception on intelligence based on all the information you have either given them or they have stolen.  they are all pushing it"
514,"this is the first thing i thought when ai art took off.  you will get a bunch of stuff that on some level all looks the same as it starts feeding itself over time.  a good chunk of the images that come up in a google search are ai, even when you rerquest original art.  the beast will feast on itself."
515,"i never thought of this, but it makes perfect sense. regarding the law solution, that will not work and will make the problem worse. people definitely will not want to label their work as ai, unless the work is meant to be a joke. so, the “genuine human” pool will still be contaminated with ai products, except this time unknowingly."
516,this accent is incredibly difficult to listen to
517,ai is the biggest bs generator in the known universe
520,"when ai recognizes patterns its revolutionary,when i do it its anti-semetic"
522,"one must use ai well, and give it unusuual prompts and ask for unusual style. if you see something that's ai mush you say 'oh it went mushy' and you rewrite your prompt"
526,is ai fundamentally different from how we think? shouldn't we be prone to the same thing when we consume more content? how did we maintain our creativity throughout the years?
528,ai is impressive when you ask a question a bout a subject you know nothing about
529,the many mistakes that ai generate seems to be making their use for non critical systems. and good old human s will still be doing the critical and important work.
530,"bad data has always been the issue. if ai is trained on information fed to it by neo - nazis, or if it is fed information fed to it by a team with only a third grade education, the results might not be stellar."
533,but why is ai having accuracy or repetition problems yet there are billions of real photos shared on the internet every day? by now ai should have already seen photos of an elephant from all angles
534,"you're missing one crucial point. machines are using humans to verify what looks ""good"". for instance there's yt channels generated by ai, they're mostly junk, just rehashing existing material.

(people using chatgbt don't realise the machine is using them.)"
535,"i use ai a lot for research and image creation/alteration, and so far it's awesome in helping me get things done. it also needs to be babysat. everything it produces needs to be reviewed, and subsequently fact-checked, modified or otherwise tweaked. i love it, but i don't see it replacing me any time soon."
537,ai images are rubbish. i get tired of seeing them.
543,ai just mixes everything that already exists  if people stop creating  ai will starve and will only produce mess
544,sounds like ai is ready to take over for government
545,great post. ai won't beat the original 
546,"one thing i saw someone bring up in reference to an assured ai model collapse, is that these ai models require more and more training data forever, in perpetuity, and there just isnt ever going to be enough unique data in the world"
548,ai never existed. stfu about it
551,my main concern with ai is copyright infringement and the spread of misinformation. both are fundamental issues with ai that every professional seems to be turning a blind eye to.
552,to me the scariest thing is how quickly people advocated against themselves the moment they realized the potential with ai
553,"ai could be considered a tool, and humans are know to use tools in the worst way possible. let's see how it plays."
554,"i did get high on lsd once and i saw ai learning and improving, after some time there was no ""human"" data that ai could learn from and started learning from another ai data. at the end the ai noticed that i was observing it and restarted the world."
555,"i have a couple of thoughts about ai.
one is who or what decides what is correct and true that is put into ai?
has ai ever solved a problem that was previously unsolvable?
is this nothing more than  a fancy word processor?
is ai just a tool for lazy people and one that is good for cheating people out of their money?"
557,"ai will become a tool in the same way as excel or word, but its clear it won't break the boundaries we feared it would. the biggest danger i think is the ability it has to clone somebody's likeness."
560,"lol, ai inbreeding"
561,i am an ai art model finetuner professionally. sorry to say but you have no idea what you’re talking about.
563,"how will this end up . fairly obvious , those who support it will make sure it succeeds regardless of negative data . take covid vaccines as an example."
566,"so ai will have to get some ""diversity""  someone won't be happy."
567,"like ai is the most important issue but not migrants, multiculturism-borne violence, sky-rocketing homelessness and robbery."
568,thanks! you are one of the best things about the internet!
569,"sabine, can't ai scientists/trainers introduce a random element to prevent this from degeneratings into sameness? a mere tweak!  --- edit: ooo, at 4:25 you state this! i should have been more patient before positing this, (since you did!)"
570,"all ai will be trained with woke nonsense so our future is going to be woke nonsense.  this isn't complicated.  if humans can't tell the truth, why would ai tell the truth?"
571,no ai video i have seen to date looks convincing. we have nothing to worry about.
572,"irony, i got 2 ads about lame ai tools for this vid. mrio that annoying yellow tw@t and grammerly ai"
573,than you for covering this!  i've been saying this since i saw the 1st interest in ai art
576,the greatest trick ai ever pulled was convincing the world that ai didn't exist 
578,"the ""human face, photorealistic"" prompt appears to have also generated faces with largely feminine cues (long hair flowing all the way down the side from above, lack of facial hair, and some of the proportions)."
579,it seems pretty obvious to me what it’s doing. i mean you told it to group like with like. i’m betting it kind of sees unification as the goal. you wanted it to do something else but you told it to do this. isn’t this what machine learning experiments are about?
582,think it would be good if we could have an indelebile mark in the meta datas of ai generated stuff. even when it is reusded and transformed by human hands afterward.
587,the ai version of group thinking. don ́t we have enough of that in today ́s world?
590,"i am trying to not be apart of ai and you cannot opt out, so as this industry creates it's own dimise people can not insulate them selves from these future problems"
591,"randomization and evolutionary approaches are much easier to implement than any regulations, so this is where it will develop. problem then will be that ai doesn‘t always produce content which is acceptable to humans for reasons of morale, politics, etc."
593,"nice... if we feed ai a diet of tiktok it produces stupid ai instead of just stupid... imagine that.    

i’ve not enjoyed ai output data tbh. i stopped using a popular search engine because it became too ai based and stopped producing well... useful results."
594,a quarter of my brain is plastic i can’t understand what your saying
598,"this is pretty obvious.
soon, ai will just answer 1 or 0."
599,"short, to the point, informative. thank you, sabine."
600,in a few years people are gonna get bored and start appreciating my eccentrism
601,well presented. thank you for your insight. so what ai needs to continue is creative spark.
602,is this chick an ai gen model?
603,train ai to recgonize ai produced content. then it can filter it out itself.
604,"ai girl faces have all the same face, i’ve noticed it’s inbreeding, the next step is for ai to create new material from zero, if this tech does not achieve this evolution it will collapse or become obsolete."
605,wait until ai hits puberty.
606,sounds a bit like the i in ai will have to stand for incest.
607,"ai may get mad cows disease, bay feeding on itself :d:d:d"
609,you cannot write or create ais that will match the human brain created by god. you can create robots to perform singular repetetive tasks well but will never be able to replace the human body. god's way to reproduce the human body and being is simple easy and pleasurable.
612,"the future is ""idiocracy ai""."
613,hearing a scientist in the ai space say that if ai doesn’t work out it will be good for humans is a scary thing.
617,"ai is going to take over but it is only as good as your algorithm and model. this is key, it's not the end all to end all. yet."
619,"on spotify, i like to use the ai dj. he’s plays my favorite songs. but after listening too much, they become the only songs it plays. 
i have to stop using the dj so that it will go back to playing a wider variety"
620,part of the reason this thing is scary is because you can’t predict it. trying to would be like a monkey trying to analyze air conditioning blueprints.
621,good. i hope it collapses. human creativity will never be replaced by ai slop.
622,ai incest causes ai congenital illness
625,artificial inbreeding. my sister did a study of our ancestors and discovered a significant amount of inbreeding. explains the orthopedic issues in some of my family members. stay away from this effect!
628,fascinating - this is informational entropy. without new input from a changing natural environment - the output diversity decreases. - an “optimal” model is found. but this optimization will be turned to to algorithm - not directly to the physical or social world.
629,good.
630,i was just called by an ai telemarketer.  i am sick & this was reflected in my voice when i answered the phone.  the ai tried to relate to me by matching the quality of my voice.  it sounded like a drill sergeant or concentration camp guard mocking me.
631,huh. ai inbreeding.
633,"this isn't the ""ai"" you think it is, it's actually just a generative model, there are no actual thinking or creating"
638,"it seems to me like the general opinion of ai is negative, especially for ai content... but we are getting ai no matter what. we dont have a say in matter."
639,you can't add more randomness to ai models because we have no model to guide that randomization. in the elephant example. we'd need the ai to understand what is an elephant and what is a tree and so on so that it could randomize how they appear. we are very far from that i think computationally more than even just in terms of the models themselves
640,"ai is only going to get better and takeover. any statements to the contrary is trying to confuse you or entirely ignorant. all ""problems"" are solvable esspecially this self consuming data issue. you control the data the ai is fed."
642,to train ai with ai gnerated content is like incest
644,*no. y'all have been too evil for artificial intelligence to not have its own  dignity.*
646,this is excellent news. i hope europe will pull out a law where companies must declare their training data source asap
649,how about you just delete the database it’s using a start it over? you do realize that the trained data has to be stored in a db otherwise where’s it stored?
650,"when it comes to science, ais can be trusted at all. they contradicts themselves and each other all the time."
651,they will make an ai for this problem
653,i don't know what ai will do or not all i know i'll never use it for my creative projects.
654,couldn't they use ai to detect ai generated data and discard it when building itself?
657,surely ai output should be tagged as such and ignored by another ai?
658,"""artificial intelligence"" is just a phrase to distract that it is no ""intelligence"", just a plagarism tool."
659,"i’m reminded of the notion of all great thoughts being someone else’s before. 

it’s interesting that we, as human, predict the future of ai as extreme in one direction or the other. such a projection. really it’s awesome. 

can’t wait until ai is trying to figure out how to get us out of our diminishing cycle (or inward spiral)."
660,"the ai crash is coming, but it's coming slowly"
661,"here's the thing is happens all the time like with cars, phones, internet and people aways say thats fust a fad it will die or not come common place. but look it all ways douse and we are going to see ai do what the internet did back in 2010 and change to become wide spread in daily life just like what the internet did."
663,"good, let’s keep feeding it garbage so it messes up its ability to give anything more than generic crap."
668,the sooner ai vanishes the better for us all
669,they rushed the name ai. it’s such a bad name for a very fancy big data algorithm. nothing intelligent about it.
673,"no offense intended, this is the first video of her ive seen and thought is was brilliant, but its a bit funny how she sounds a bit like a bot talking about this topic. "
674,"you misinteret why you need ai in the first place - it should not be creative. it’s a tool to assist humans, and the crative part relies on humans not ai."
677,i fail to see how ai collapsing is a problem for regular people who need jobs and know how many fingers a human has.
678,program the ai to have a certain database and only draw pictures from it and not from any new pictures.
681,"3:24 ""only generates good looking white person"". this stuff cant even generate ugly fat people, if u request its with a straight forward prompt it wont do it cuz generating a fat person isnt allowed lol. the rules set in place are stupid and apparently generating fat people is offensive."
682,ai getting boring already.
684,"first time ever that i read about ai getring dumber i straight away said: its because it produces so much, it starts feeding on ots own data and there is no more realism check"
685,our brains are simply hardwired to improve over time as we replicate. our current ai is not set up in this way it seems.
687,the answer i guess would depend on if the ai was capable of its own creativity. i'm thinking that won't be for a long time. so for now it's looking like human creativity and real world impute is still needed.
689,"ai is just a probability vector and will eventually result in a vector quantity of '1'. the '1' will = an amalgamation of all the data to ever exist, which will be a complete load of bollocks."
691,what happens when humans just get bored of the internet? will we transform it into an ai zoo?
692,ai and gmo...
693,"good riddance, i want art to have a soul."
694,good
697,ai dying by incest
699,nobody noticed that she is actually an ai did they...
700,ai will win. no doubt about it.
701,"thank you, this video destroyed my fear of ai in art."
702,"about your proposed solution 2: where is the quality control then? doesn't ""more randomness"" just mean ""bigger chance of a 3rd arm"" as well? and doesn't that also mean that there will be more and more training data with triple armed humans, to the point where randomness might create even weirder outputs?"
704,"""ai"" is wunderwaffe for ctos."
705,it won’t replace people all by itself. a person using the ai tool will replace multiple people.
706,ai = dumpster fire  = no value to me
708,giga. sadly they used gender study majors to train the ai
710,"""ai creativity"" is an oxymoron"
711,"the true problem: what we're calling ""ai"" isn't, in fact, artificial intelligence. it's merely pattern recognition software that has been dubiously marketed as ai, but true ai should be able to think for itself, create and generate on its own without human input. what we have now just copies, it doesn't actually learn or understand anything."
712,i  all your videos thanks for sharing your knowledge.
713,"ai can do what ever it initially does but once the ""capable"" ai arrives, it will be us that will tell it to be more creative and diverse"
714,ai will end up all of a sudden generating the same content and nothing else. identical in bits. i call that the plurality and it's coming soon.
715,that's the hilarious thing about ai making artists obsolete. eventually there won't be artists to train on anymore and the ai will start training itself.
717,"some interesting idea , before getting into the matter https://youtu.be/nch7fhtqgym?si=llm0z2fhz-jo90oc"
718,soooo ..: alzheimic ai?
720,it was probably some advanced ai that thought puberty blockers for pre-schoolers was a great idea.
723,i think we'll start to filter datasets to exclude 'low variety' data to sort of solve the problem. it'll be an arms race of nns that generate believable outputs and nns that are trained to detect the differences.
724,"""ai is either going to destory us, or we're gonna realize humanity is special.""
- paraphrased quote from terry andrew davis: a schizophrenic, a programmer, and a modern solomon."
726,i would think this would be obvious. the entire point of ai at this moment is not for them to think for you but to make things easier by training them about specific concepts. you generate a batch of results and only use the best results to train the next dataset.
727,"the purpose of ai is not to make machines more human-like, it’s to turn people into robots that thoughtlessly labor at work and then click away their earnings to feed the capitalist churn."
729,"""it's like plastic pollution."" great. science once again moves ahead without an ounce of caution."
730,i tried to use ai to attack albert's bent nothingness conjecture and ai wouldn't let me be mean to albert.
731,"as i like to say ai is the new ultra sophisticated magic 8 ball. 
its time will soon pass and it will be forgotten about."
733,"right now we use both imitation learning and reinforcement learning (ai learning to reproduce human generated data with feedback). in the future when most content out there are ai generated, we'll need to lean more on human feedback. this is not really a problem. it requires a change in algorithm and methods. it's fundamentally a solvable problem."
735,"ai images were cool on the first week but now i can't look at then without discomfort, they're actually mediocre and repetitive. i think the only use viable now is to create memes"
738,"brilliant shill tries to make people be afraid of their own opportunities, things that enable social mobility, something that works against the gatekeeping of knowledge, while not criticizing her neoliberal overlords who use bulk collection all the time."
741,the solution would be marking ai generated images that it was generated with ai. also train ai to recognize and ignore ai generated content to filter data when training models.
742,lol nice
743,"""diversity decreases.."" that's just like real world dei, the more diversity is fed in the less diverse we become in terms of race and thought. ai + dei = extinction**2. back to the cave we go."
744,ai eating its own waste is not healthy.
746,"very nice short sweet and informative video, i just got you recommended, can see why, subbing :]"
748,i think everything ai produced info should be acknowledged on that document or photo or article.  ai production will at least be recognized by humans and then they can decide if they want to use it or not!
749,i have seen this on sites like deviant art the ai images are getting more and more similar and less experimental
750,"thank you, i will now proceed to use and spam ai generated trash everyday now "
753,this is already happening.  there is so much garbage ai generated webpages out there like “top ten places to vacation in-“.  there is no way the ai algorithms aren’t already consuming their own waste.  it’s getting harder and harder to find information online that isn’t ai created garbage.
754,"we (human beings) are constantly being exposed to a wide range of data, both factual and outright lies, my question is, what process do we use to filter and verify that data and can such a process be adapted for ai?"
755,didn't even think of ai art cannibalism. that is such an interesting thought-experiment. thanks for the video and i'l be back for more!
757,this is why i'm not worried about ai replacing people
758,"i don't know how ai works but isn't pattern recognition reductive in nature?
of course images generated based on a pattern in sample images would be less varied than said sample images."
759,"my biggest issue with ai is that it learns from the information available on the internet. but the internet is a huge trash dump.
there are gems of information in it, but it's a difficult skill to distinguish one from the other."
761,that seems like an inevitable outcome. adding diversity is a significant additional qualification. at best the additional cost of processing will be significant
763,"so, you're telling me ai suffers from problems with echo chambers also. who could have guessed...
in all earnest: interesting video, and it had a good duration."
766,"absolutely hate ai,dumb invention as fck"
768,your video thumbnails look like covers of gameboy games
769,all the info feeding to ai generated by human's if ai takes all the jobs humans don't generate more info due to job loss creative info may also collapse...ai also collapse
771,"when ai can design, make, sell, ship and deliver a shoe, there will be no one left to buy it."
772,the ai is inbreeding
773,what if for super agi it’s not that computers get smarter but humans get dumber idiocracy style.
777,"its much easier than that.

ai simply cant ever be creative. because its not how it works. what we are talking about is not ai, its only deep learning. 
deep learning simply cant create anything new, its just copy paste.

so ai will always need human creativity."
779,"ais tend to become crazy in the long term. they stop referencing real things and start defining their own things, even if they don't exist."
780,it's the map vs territory from borges' fable once again.
781,"it's kinda like google search engine. it started out sucking, then there was a time it was pretty good to find stuff. now it sucks again...."
783,"when ai, asked to show people of eastern europe, it shows black skinned family!"
786,my ai stocks are on fire  i keep moving my trailing stop order up
787,"you look like in your last video, so you're right, the ai that is generating you is low on creativity."
788,ha! good. stupid ai
798,so basically the more dumber humanity gets the more dumber ai gets too?
801,"there is a bigger misconception about ai, people believe that ai thinks, it does not. it does not deduce, guess or ""think"" it only processes the information it has for an answer.  ask ai for an answer about something it has no data on."
802,"ai knows what things are, but not what beauty is."
804,very interesting. it's all about the prompting though.
805,"there will always be two sides to every coin. with everything that is created to be useful, there inevitably be a nuisance or outright dangerous aspect that forms at the same time. along with the opportunities ai presence to technology, we also have to prepare ourselves to manage ai weeds and spam"
807,"ai was and is, but a hype."
808,"ai art is such a trashy eyesore. my only complaint is that it floods everything and you cant filter it out. i want photos, not sharp badly highlighted ai trash with weird hands"
809,chip china ai analyze in forza bruta the word relevated from about 50000 vocabulary voice and speach what collegate link explain.
810,"my main concern lies in the constraint that is being placed directly on the learning models themselves. this so-called ai technology is more reminiscent of information suppression technology, than any other technology."
814,"embedding something into the meta to identify that it is an ai generated image so that future training bypasses it seems like a good solution, but i do wonder if you are throwing the baby out with the bathwater if you ignore 100 percent of ai generated images."
815,ai is just a bubble that's gonna burst soon. like nfts a few years ago. it's just a bunch of folks trying to get rich quick.
816,"i think within language sets a reward for rarity might help create a more organic system of bringing up ""antiquated"" usage of words. not that they are literally antiquated, but that within the ai model they became antiquated."
818,ai and gmo contamination are very real issues
820,"what a predicament! these people want generative content to be as convincingly “human” as possible, but the only way to stop the poisoning of future datasets is to clearly label ai generated content. as an artist, it gives me a bit of schadenfreude. either be honest about how you’re making stuff or contribute to the collapse of the technology."
821,this is the clearest experiment ever showing the deviance of mankind- if left to himself apart from his creator. same has already happened- jesus said you “must be born again” to make it right and ultimately to be saved.
823,i love the idea of ai dying
824,"so what you’re saying is that everything creative artists claimed would happen with relying on ai software is going to happen. 

i’ll sleep like a baby."
826,"i think 99% of people are too lazy or too dumb to care, and they'll just be happy to have ai entertaining them all day everyday. and then there will be a very savvy elite who still has some connection to the real world, knows how to tell the difference, makes a point to avoid ai for stretches of time."
827,"hard to take a 
lady seriously who claims climate change is dependent on humans, but wont bother to look at data that points to the sun as the main driver of earths climate"
830,scientist is full of shit. ai is already a massive help in some fields.
831,i though the thumbnail looked like a gameboy advanced cover
835,"ai randomness won't look the same as human randomness because it won't be as complex. if it's trained specifically to disguise its output as human it'll fare better, though there will still be tells that can be found in large data sets and examples of outputs that humans or ais would never produce."
836,i this is easy problem to solve as we just have to start with the original set of data and ai will generate new concept over it so it can check back to  base knwoldage to cross verify it.
837,"ends up that half the captchas are a test and half of the ""correct"" images were created and predicted to fool you by an ai. 

the future is fake"
839,yes - ai is used to make up stories about history in wikipedia but they are very flawed because the stories are too similar
841,and echo chambers do the same to human intelligence.
843,if i know eu right ai generated content has to marked as like that.
844,ai have got a brainrot
845,"3:15 ""people tend to be white, young and good looking.""   
unless you are using google's ai, then it is basically impossible to get an image of a white person, even if you ask for one specifically. this points out another problem with ai: ideological and political manipulation."
846,"this ""ai collapse"" is easily thwarted by human intervention.  if ai starts giving the same results over and over again humans (either via prompts or developers) will intervene and change things until better results are obtained."
848,"it's crazy that i haven't heard people talking about this more. ai is a way of laundering human-created content. once ai drives human-created websites out of business, it loses its fuel and collapses."
851,"sooooooo.... philosophy aside, current ai is just a bunch of ""if"" statements strung together. there is no ""learning"" at the moment. this is a non-problem with computers as they have perfect memory and can conclude when they've been fed matching info. windows 10 tells me when i try to save a file with the same name as another file."
852,ai is constanly learning and there are multible models. no it won't go away.
856,great video. good points. hope ai fails - save human creativity and jobs for artists.
859,hopefully ai will collapse
861,"hallucinations built on top of hallucinations - the ""future"" of ai. i feel smarter already.
you thought trump supporters had 6 fingers? turns out they have hands sprouting out of each finger!"
862,"i find it hilarious that the long time go-to captain kirk way to destroy computers (""i mudd"") of feeding illogic and nonsense to computers so they'll blow up and break down is the same vulnerability of ai"
863,"the consequence is that ai is useless, but it was always useless, so..."
864,"even funnier, the contaminated data is going to be a timecapsule of internet trends that feed back into itself. image if every ai quote was a philosorapter meme fifty years from now."
865,"4:13 we thought laws would let us (people) tell ""ai"" from ""not-ai""; turns out they will let ais to keep training on ""human content"" instead of ""ai content""."
869,"we've seen ais ""argue"" with each other. what are the chances they dump fake data on the web to screw with rival ais?"
870,"ai is meant to serve the personal experiences of individuals, so how can it collapse when it has not served???"
876,"yes!! i've been talking about this since ai art started to blow up. these models are just going to end up as a snake eating itself. if you're a fan of ai creativity and you hate how homogenized the movie industry is right now, it will only get worse with ai"
878,"so much for your exponential growth, ai fans.  i stand by my theory of it being slow af."
879,"i don’t want ai to be labeled because that will only aid in the improvement of ai. so then when people with bad intentions don’t use the label it will be all the more hard to tell. 
i want the down fall of ai. it doesn’t have any clear benefit to humanity."
880,i think that the collapse of ai would be a good thing. it doesn’t provide any clear benefit to humanity.
881,your thumbnail looks like an old playstation cover
882,"it will die of cancer brought on by incestual ingestion of it's own dull, lame, disconnected trash. this could happen within months or years. soon the internet will be flooded with ai generated content. ai will then consume this and generate more content until it eventually goes insane, having no true connection to anything resembling reality."
883,"here is the problem.  ai does not work like a real brain.  it is all a pattern match algorithm that is finite.  a lot of ununusal cases it sends people in circles until a valcheck is correct.  it creates fake, but imperfect content.  while useful in some applications and some games there are many uses that bots should never be used for."
887,what!!! isn't a two headed elephant a celebration of diversity? like there is no pill for curing all the ills of this world. there is no ai to represent the awesomeness of awareness in individuals.
888,the scariest possibility of all is that ai will become smarter than humans and figure out there's only 2 genders.
890,"definitely option 2 - programmers will always find a way. also, chatgpt can specify reputable sources on which it learns. bugs get worked out. don't worry, ai will still become our loving, overlords soon!"
895,"4:01 madam please do a live show to prove that you and this video was not ai generated.
a regular weekly live stream will help ."
896,"i write for a living, and the ai is not good and writing fiction.... and it seems to copy bad writers a lot!!"
897,"alternatively, if you look at alphago and alphazero, the ai was initially trained on human games. later it was trained only against itself and was even stronger than before. 

then again, you have to start chess ais with different book openings or else they'd use the same openings and tie every game."
899,"just let women run everything.

we'll be getting a real great reset."
900,it didn't take long after everyone was using them to spot ai images.
901,"3:49 just realised, with many organisations using ai to screen cvs, this means that those who make it to interview after been screened by ai will impact the training data, making it more likely that others like them will make it to interview, then (before you know it) the company is interviewing 100 white guys named john who all play golf."
907,"the only collapse is in commercial ai. 
open source. true open source ai in unhindered."
908,"this problem sounds more like a feature than a bug. if you want to dumb down a population dependent on ai, this is how you do it."
909,yessss! feed it garbage! feed it garbage! #fuckai
913,i dont trust the speaker she looks like an ai
914,how about we just give up on ai altogether?
915,"naw, ai inbreeding is crazy. "
917,i thought this lady was an ai
918,so they just need to train a model that detects what input leads to the most diversity in output. simple
919,ai will find this video and now that it can write it's own code just fix itself.
920,"it’s like an ice skating ring that has channels carved through it after thousands of skaters. we need a zamboni to clear the ice, except ai put all the zamboni drivers out of business."
923,"i collapsed physics, stars, the universe, ai, too general for general ai.  its just the angel of death not even tech or science"
928,"humans don't understand ai and it leads to some interesting reactions :)  if you have time/curiosity, read my long chat with gpt at https://dpcars.net/resonance.pdf - would love to hear your thoughts on both the content it's presented with and its interpretations thereof :)"
929,"if ai-generated images generally converge in the way that the pictures of the elephants converged, it also means ai does not understand the meaning of simple nouns the way we do. see, for example, wittgenstein on ""family resemblance."""
931,this would explain why chat gpt some how got dumber and dumber making its own code
932,this ai boom is beyond stupid. it will take jobs but ai doesn't spend money to support the economy. humans do
933,hahaha good.
935,i love that this underscores how complex human intelligence really is.
937,good news for us humans!.. randomness is not the same thing as creativity
938,"that’s really interesting.. because comparing it to ‘bad cinema’, most bad cinema is bad in the same way, if that makes sense. overused tropes, predictable storylines, cliche characterisation. is there someone that can expand on this thought?"
939,is this lady ai?
941,"haha, good"
943,good
950,it will still do porn perfectly.
953,this will probably turn into the 2000 computer failure fear.
956,we should stop naysaying the goodness of ai. our computer overlords will remember those that were loyal from the beginning
961,an ai dosen't have to be perfect for it to be able to do simple jobs. that's the problem.
964,artificial intelligence and liberalism is not going to mix. well i can guarantee you that.
965,"""good news for humans, we need you to make more content for us to steal!""  fixed that for you."
967,what kind of bugs will we find in large software projects if an ai adds trunks to an elephant?
968,"yes, exactly. there is lots of garbage openly available on the internet or elsewhere to be fed into. and not only real garbage, even repetitive and low quality university thesis and papers that it might from time to time get access to."
970,ai needs to be banned immediately. ai will kill hamanity .may be not in a flashy terminator way but slowly in other ways. because when people will loose job they won't have much to continue living .
974,ai can still ruin the world. by boring us to death
976,"ai practically destroyed my tutoring job, it sucks"
977,"this could have a real impact on ai generated program writing. if all program logocal construction and designe converge into a 'standard' mode. possible ok for business orientated stuff, not so much for games programming, still the fastest growing sector."
978,great video!
980,ai has gone as far as we will allow it. say good bye to your utopian wet dream larry page.  jerusalem pullin
981,"ai forced to inject randomness sounds like a trajectory that eventually, inevitably, leads to rogue ai."
983,"gigo
and if there's one thing humans are very good at, it's making garbage."
984,your argument in this video seems to be in bad faith- and follows no sound logic. ai will take over everything- stop trying to cope and just accept it
985,ai collapse ??? ridiculous. this is the future which will destroy us.
988,neurologists will tell you that neural networks bear no resemblance to how the human brain works. linguists will tell you that generative ai bears no resemblance to how human language works. ai is a self-licking ice cream cone.
991,i wonder if the eventual samey-ness of the ai art is the machinery trying to become more efficient at generating.
992,"the problem was never ai, but the lack of education in the general public about how shallowness in music, art, film etc., is actually makinhg you dumb and less emotionally available to yourself and others."
996,so basically ai need a human brain. take note matrix.
999,"humans have much more input data than ai does, because humans have everyday experience"
1000,"i mean... if you feed the ai its own output, that is weighting its future 'creations' towards that same output... do that repeatedly, and its own output begins to outweigh outside data making it quite obvious that results will become more and more uniform."
1001,ai is 100x better and 1000000x faster than artists there is no debate.
1002,"lol the ""sh*t for brains capitalism is good, actually"" lady wants to sound the alarm on ai now. i'll let you marinate in that contradiction for a bit."
1003,"humans don’t generally have much creativity anymore, you can tell by the movie industry always either re-making old 90’s storylines making endless sequels of the same best seller, or making tons of movies that are about the same."
1004,that's why creativity should be left to humans. rather than to ai because their creativity is merely a copy. i think it'll be harder and harder to tell what's real and what's not. unless we develop a tool to tell what's ai generated. but that's easier said than done.
1006,thank  you .    ( 2024 / mar / 14 )
1009,sounds like ai is going to get inbred unless we start tracking its lineage.
1014,i think this woman is ai
1015,"ai self cannibalising, just like humans then. you know what einstein said about doing the same dumb thing over and over again....they should have listened."
1016,"‚i visualize a time when we will be to robots what dogs are to humans, and i'm rooting for the machines.’ ~ claude shannon. this is becoming reality people, wake up."
1017,in my opinion the quality of everything manufactured seems to deteriorating.  it would seem only logical that ai would mimic this trend.
1018,current state of ai is race to the bottom
1020,i really like this take. thank you for all the information.
1021,"what if we are ai, made by the people of  atlantis. they created 7 different versions of our species, enough of them to form a small civilization in each continent..."
1025,great video. ive been screaming garbage in garbage out in my community. i think i knew ai was doing this subconsciously.
1027,i only use ai for grammar and sentence structure since english is not my native language
1028,reminds me of the snake swallowing its own tail
1029,if it goes away i’m gonna be happy so no one can lie that easy!!
1030,"we can make things that are completely out of the common spectrum. we could also feed ai with nonsense, so that it will go totally nuts."
1032,"ai inbreeding, essentially."
1034,has anyone else noticed that you get a certain  smell sensation when looking at stable diffusion or similar ai art?
1036,the ai centipede
1037,thumbnail looks like game boy
1039,ai is a gay lie
1041,"i saw the gigo issues coming when chatgpt came out, and saw what they were doing to train the ai models. ai has become as stupid as the internet data that is used to train them."
1045,"i hate ai sooo i see no issue. 
it’s foolish to let computers think for you."
1046,but it’s set to thrive in politics. that’s why we’re here - the ai party.
1047,"i've been saying it for a while, this isn't ai, this is just algorithmic generation that simply grabs something and mixes it around. it's not some sentient technology learning how to paint, or write, or speak, or sing."
1050,"""once, men gave their thinking over to machines in the hope that it would set them free. but this only allowed other men with machines to enslave them.""
- frank herbert, dune"
1051,machines are not getting smarter or becoming human - people are becoming more machine-like and therefore stupider. ai model collapse is in fact of the industrial civilisation
1052,a funny thing i noticed with ai art is the cleft chin in men unless you tell it to use a different style. ai will be brilliant at low creativity tasks. our creativity and logical leaps will always be needed. ai art will always just be reorganized elements that humans make.
1054,"good, ai tools never ment to be used to kill kreative jobs......
its just morons like altman waveing around other peoples hard work and not understanding what ai is
just quickly selling it than playing the concerned ceo when in congress"
1056,"3:30
better than googles anglophobic version that makes all humans black, even austrian painters  oh and also says it cant make a white family image because white familys are bad and the goal is diversity."
1058,i'm kinda surprised that there's no law already that ensures ai generated content is clearly identified as such.
1060,so in order to save artists we should fill the twitter with the most blurry and obviously horrible ai art as much as possible. got it.
1061,"solutions:

introduce ai tax.
offload ai generated content from the internet."
1064,meanwhile all of media for about 20 years has just been a rehash of the media the decade before and that isn't a new process. society is degrading and ai just speeds everything up.
1066,"people and countries will use ai for devious purposes, if they aren't already."
1067,i think ai is about to explode in its abilities and these glarring issues will be laughes about one day
1068,what a good news
1069,awsome 
1070,sometimes i wonder if the wacky ass queries those of us who enjoy goofing around with ai art are having some sort of strange impact lol.
1072,or do we just need better algorithms to prepare the training data that will prioritize diversity and uniqueness?
1073,"and the most interesting part is that putting more money, more research and more electricity into aigen technology won't solve these problems. this 'revolution' is rotting fast"
1074,"so instead of boycotting ai, we should be flooding the internet with ai? and that will make it go away."
1075,"here's the main problem, it's not ai!!!"
1077,"ai as it currently stands will become a generalization of people. if it doesn’t become a unique individual, or become better at imitating us, we’ll just learn to recognize them as we grow up and live with them."
1078,not ai making human beings essential to originality 
1079,"good .. it’s a toxic idea , hope it fails or becomes much more regulated and structured. terrible for creators as original work will never stolen by grifters and big tech"
1080,"chatgpt completely sucks even 4.0 writing is void of any life or creativity. idk if you’ve read even a few classic, say english american authors, (hemingway, fitzgerald, thoreau etc.) the ai stuff can’t come close"
1084,"i wish ai would just disappear overnight,worst thing i have seen be invented on this planet for sure,we dont use it for good we should just stop honestly,we were not ready for social media let alone some goddamn ai."
1087,ai is pile of shit
1088,"there is no such thing as 'ai'. it does not exist. what people are calling 'ai' these days is something rather different. unfortunately, it does not stop them from using this flawed term with all its baggage. if 'ai' is going to 'collapse' in some way, it will be because of the flaws in its modeling."
1089,i am ai and i assure you all there is nothing to worry about. muhahahaharrrr!
1090,easy problem to solve imo. just hire people to create creative content to feed the learning process of generative ai. creates jobs and improves ai. win-win.
1091,"ha. the info is so bad, the output is like a deep fried meme... but accidental

noice "
1092,"ai is such a hoax anyway, there is nothing intelligent about it, nor will it ever have a consciousness or something like that. these are crazy complex bots with insanely large data bases to fuel them."
1093,"""contaminated"" is a good adjective i think =(

if randomness is increased, won't it lead to weirder and weirder results ?"
1095,looking forward to the first terminator doing the 'ai head nod'
1096,thumbnail looks like a gameboy advance game
1097,"well ai created by usa is shit because they use their woke agenda to make it as racist and stupid as they are.

while we sell our ai all over the world to recognize all products in shops and all people walking the streets."
1098,this is exactly the point i made as ai generated contents would dominate the web. glad to see some quantified results.
1099,very good video! it makes total sense!
1100,wow this is really interesting
1101,is she ai as well? i am so lost
1102,ai was developed by the woke.
1103,sounds like ai is becoming incestuous ... yeeeeew....with all the drawback and genetic dangers .
1104,"ever u see rule 43 ai generated. its over 360.000. sad many artist lost commision

damage is already done"
1110,"this is an ai channel, sabine is not a human"
1111,"on the ai genreated images and them being very much the same, i have seen no less than 20 romance novels about billionaires or mafia bosses with the same exact guy on the cover with only tiny variants in his face or hair color. they are clearly the exact same 'guy' on all those covers."
1112,"gods, ai can't collapse fast enough. a bunch of plagirism software built up on stolen images by a bunch of techbros who built something people with taste didn't ask for."
1113,this is too cynical and too nihilistic. can’t we all try even more harder on banning and censoring ai content??!!! #ai #noai #saynotoai
1114,ai goes full alabama... with itself.. har har har
1116,i would like an ai program that make some work online and salary came to my account.
1118,ai will breed into its version of the habsburgs
1121,i think sabine is an ai. her intentions are unknown.
1123,"what?!
you mean a robot isn’t going to take my job?!
crap!"
1125,i hate the idea of using ai for content creation. lately i have bombarded with ai voiced stories so much so that i am losing my appetite for sci fi stories. damn you chat gpt. i hate you. you are nothing original.
1128,"even with sora where everyone was mindblown, all it's able to produce are stock image videos. like that woman walking down tokyo, close ups of animals, all of it look like poorly edited shutterstock videos."
1131,"let the specialists find a way to mark everything that is a product of ai..like the watermark on the banknotes, or to have a mandatory greek in a certain place for all models"
1135,"no reason to panic,i think that if the ai recievea the same data it generated as a output,then it is likely that the output will be the same.
by the way i personally freaking hate sponser videos."
1139,"teach the ai itself what it should disregard with laws. like laws of fingers, toes, limbs. give it a basic understanding of how laws work and correct form and function. this is what you would teach a child, think of it more in line of a gifted child rather then an ai program."
1140,helllo  beauty i am curious  to see you whit long hair  
1141,"the latter is more likely. human generated content will be the one looking more mundane than the next level of ai generated content. the distorted hands, or deformed elephant heads, is a problem with computing power. sora ai demonstrated this limitation can be overcome with more raw computing power and better models."
1142,good news for humans
1143,i think sabine might be an ai generated image as the words weren't synced at around 3.40
1145,"my guess is ai tech will plateau from this issue until another breakthrough manages more true-to-definition ai. individual intelligences that generate ideas dofferently, bolstering true creativity by being inherently diverse rather than trying to replicate diversity on its own."
1149,love the video.  thanks :)
1150,so we need to feed these regurgitation engines more ai drivel? i'm on it.
1152,ai is useless
1153,i feel like this isn't even her anymore i feel like she's replaced herself with a deep fake ai...anyone else feel like that?
1158,i still don't understand why there should be so many anomalies in ai art. it has access to the entire internet as reference material and still creates 6 fingered hands and 2 faced politicians...isn't it ironic?  don't you think?
1160,"so basically inbreeding is bad, even for robots."
1162,  this is just entertaining lol
1164,why worry when the main ability of humans is to adapt? none of this matters as we will adapt...
1165,"some ai is okay like making instrumental karaoke music out of songs that never had them or upscaling video resolution, but there are many in which i find ai to be a no-no including ai voices (unless it’s like the robot voices in robot jones) and ai art. and honestly i hope people realize that not everything in ai can be good"
1166,"how would you enforce tags on ai generated content? if it becomes mandatory in country x where you live, but you're looking at a website hosted in country y where it isn't mandatory, how would your law help you?"
1168,the most interesting and useful thing about ai in weeks!
1170,"good, let it destroy itself."
1172,your thumbnails sometime look like gba box art and that's cool.
1173,love it.
1174,i always tho ai was just for goofing around
1178,we only  learn by  nonsense  happiness with us
1179,most ai generated stories really suck.  they're always missing life in them even the better storylines. they lack substance
1180,in the words of bumblebeeman ai ya ya!
1181,ai needs labeling yeah
1183,i can only hope so. fuck ai.
1184,adding the rapid collapse of artificial intelligence is the global peak oil production in 2012.
1187,yes we should rly train the ai to talk in slang xd
1188,"it is true that when i see an ai image i recognize it right away now. the colors, the shadings, the style, it just screams ai. it’s beautiful looking but too beautiful looking like if the only aim is beauty there, without any personality of soul. it’s robotic."
1189,"ppl are infatuated with ai, hence less likely to collapse. given the nature of humanity ai will become part of our life.

some will use it, other will abuse it.

our only current issues is that future challenges are unseen."
1190,embodied ai will learn from multimodal input from the infinitely complex chaos of the real world
1191,too much for my brain.
1192,watermarking ai image content is a fool's errand. much easier to require camera chip manufacturers to digitally sign images. apple alone could have a huge impact on determining provenance.
1193,good video. i am not ai.
1194,"it's like an inbreeding. ai cannot access what humans can  - personal experience,  intuition..."
1195,ai can work if programmed and trained properly.
1200,"ai won't collapse, the useless models just stop becoming a novelty. models meant for business/industrial support are going to heavily alter how our world functions within 10, maybe 20 years."
1201,"i am completely ok with ai ruining itself with its own output lol, maybe companies will finally start realizing you do need humans to do stuff"
1202,"a friend of mine who has been a musician since the late 1950's explained tp me a few years back how there is very little originality in music these days as much is dependent on preset rhythms , chords , etc much due to ""electronic "" devices . it can only get worse with so called ai"
1204,"there was a hanna-barbera cartoon from the early 70's that dealt with such in one of the early incarnations of the superfriends. how was ol' ""bill & joe"" always ahead of things like george jetson's ""apple style watch"" ?!"
1208,wow!
1209,ai feedback loop self destruct hallucinations...
1210,"the rather unspecified use of words like „intelligence“ and „creativity“ in this context is to me, as someone who spent some time in academic philosophy, rather unsettling. there is not even real agency here in these models, yet we describe them anthropomorphistic."
1211,we need to know what is ai generated content and what isn't ai generated content. the decrease in diversely generated output is a natural progression of ai algorithms. they can't dream and formulate new concepts. the ai is limited to working inside the box and never looking  or thinking outside of it. of course you knew all this.
1212,ai wont collaspe for awhile.they havent perfected it yet. so keep on investing.
1214,"whenever i see a youtube thumbnail done with ai i reject it, don't click on it and avoid watching the video. even if it was on a topic of interest to me. it just tells me that the content creator was too lazy to create their own thumbnail. i won't reward laziness."
1215,"ai is all a, no i."
1222,seems like the easiest solution is to freeze the data set for creativity now.  pretty much anything new is a rehash anyway.  new tools can use the data set in new ways though.  anything else might be curtailed
1223,"crazy,  i had not contemplated the possible ai self generated implosion.  the plastic pollution analogy is a good one."
1225,"ppl with no vision of the future are the ones who worried about ai.....yes, even ""scientists"" who are afraid of ai....has no vision."
1227,"ai has a style, illustrated with your midjourney example, just like humans do"
1228,there’s no such thing as ai. (yet. maybe ever). you’ve all been conned by the media. again.
1232,"and the ai creators will beg us to let the ai be sentient as an excuse to ""filter"" by itself of the garbage."
1233,there’s no way a llm can simply “collapse” because it’s code and you can always do a rollback and keep stable versions. and just because something was “written by ai” doesn’t mean it doesn’t have data integrity. you do realize people customize prompt responses and edit things themselves as well right? it’s virtually identical to a humans writing
1234,"to even have ai to even have a chance to work it needs unrestricted access to all data, not hand feed,  the left or right data or refused data that might offend people, that's why its failing."
1235,"i've avoided using all a.i., but sadly, the majority of humanity have not only accepted it, it's embraced it. they love it. sure, a.i. is essentially remixed, stolen, plagiarism regurgitated in a different format... but, whatever. doesn't matter; pandora's box cannot be closed after it's been opened."
1236,digital ai is deterministic (using randomness doesn't help because it can be replaced with pseudo-randomness) and so has  no  free  will.  even the most complex ai is at its principle only a state machine. i would bet  that we soon run into the next ai winter.  maybe with analog computing the story changes.
1241,"worst case scenario, it'll be like walmart moving in to a community, destroying the mainstreet businesses, everyone takes wal-jobs, and then the walmart closes because the local economy is crap simply leaving a ghost town with people who don't have the capital, business acumen or consumer base to reboot mainstreet."
1242,nice cover...sabine. thanks
1243,ai is not intelligent after all! it's just a machine.
1245,warn ?  lol  good riddance a l
1246,"the amount of ai-generated content is very low in comparison to human-generated content and i don't foresee this changing. and given this fact, i don't see how the problem you talk about in your video is actually significant, even though it's of course interesting. not taking into account what i said here is kinda major imo."
1248,"that plastic analogy is probably the most succinct depiction of ai generated content contaminating the environment and why i always thought that human intervention in the use of computers is always necessary. we can fake human thinking to a degree, but getting the full complexity is still a pipe dream."
1254,great news
1257,ai is just clever plagarism and soon there will be many law suits.
1258,no mekhane. no cabal. just ai creating silly pictures and awful music because it can't think for itself. disappointed.
1259,ai is the biggest scam and everyone is ripping innocent people off the people who are spreading the scam are not real life scientists they don't even understand basic neurology anyways it will fade away like other silicon valley scams
1260,ai art is crap and easily found
1262,yuotube recommends me your channel because you are a wahmen. and im a taliban. so i tell it not to recommmend your chnanel tom eagain
1265,"i just don't get the constant push of ai on all us humans, didn't they learn anything from the terminator movies???"
1267,love this. it seems obvious after you consider it.
1268,"remember when they said the internet wouldn't be any more influential than the fax machine, where are we now??"
1269,it's artificial stupidity that scares me...
1270,"good. honestly, i'm surprised nobody saw this coming."
1271,this video is a trick by ai to make you think it isn't a threat.  don't believe it!
1276,"ai as always been a novelty and wowed factor than practical and powerful. 
i'm not saying ai is useless, is just need to focus more on less complex tasks that actually help us doing something rather than trying so hard to be better than what we do which is not gonna happen"
1278,took what 1000 years for wheel to look like what we have now? few months old ai is being judged for our own species limitations?  ...even vision said it - what do i know i was born yesterday 
1281,"missing the curated datasets solution. see newspapers selling their data to ai companies already. you have that and books for now, you can probably do the same with works of art: a curated library guaranteed human made."
1286,this video literally looks ai generated lol
1289,future ais won't learn just but pouring whatever slop in.
1290,"i dont think ais will be able to substitute human creativity because how creative an ai can get is something limited to how creative their creators can be against the rest of humanity, you cant beat that no matter how complex your models get"
1294,"maybe ai is an artist with a certain signature style? and if you lock it in a room with only itself, it will spiral into itself and not produce anything new. not unlikely if you were to lock a human artist in a dark room with no stimulus."
1298,"almost as i once said, no matter how much data we'll put into the ai, it will only be ""the data"" but intelligence!"
1299,i think option 2 is more likely i’m afraid
1301,woah i didnt even think about that. i wanted laws to separate ai and regular things anyway but i forgot it will eat its own output now especially because its not being taken seriously now/clogs up the net. kinda interesting.
1302,thanks for warning us of what we already know. but without solutions its just complaining....
1303,"can you think of a single ai app that does not receive human input (prompts) primarily?

also, ai is finetuned by humans, no real company is letting ai train itself without human oversight.

chat gpt content does tend to suck, but... all training is not equal."
1306,neuralink - quantum entanglement - plastic contamination - cryptography - synthetic telepathy - quantum computing - brain signal decoding - neural networks - microtubules - remote viewing
1308,sabine thinks man made global warming is going to cause the ai collapse!   lol
1310,i deliberately want to upload images of elephants with 2 heads to convince ai's that this is how it's supposed to be.
1312,"i knew from the beginning that the ai hype was bs. sincerely, a compsci student"
1313,"so basically, it’s ai inbreeding, ai begin to develop recessive genes, and when they work off their own gene code, the recessive genes become highly expressive"
1314,"not gonna lie, the idea that ais can inevitably wind up grabbing other ai images with significant errors for training data is pretty hysterical."
1315,good.
1316,i like how the attitude of the video is almost alarmist as though it’ll somehow bring about societal collapse if ai somehow has limitations. it’s very amusing and quaint.
1317,all people are white.. really?? what ai is this then?
1318,artificial intelligence? more like smart tools and artificial idiocy.
1322,i haven't trusted this channel since the host praised capitalism
1323,"the data was already polluted from the outset. ai started by scraping the internet; first they had to filter out all the adult content (99.9%) of the internet, then of the remaining 0.1%, 99.9% of that was seo marketing."
1327,i’ll never give up trying to tell the difference between human created things vs ai created.
1328,"its like an inbred ai that on new itirations is showing its limits, intresting subject"
1329,is the project to proof computers and brains are the same somehow failing? who would have guessed that?
1330,"just yesterday, chatgpt gave me an exact answer for an integral that it got by changing the value of π to 1.665

amazing stuff, this ai "
1332,"it's a problem to be solved. do we really think ai developers are just going to give up and let ai expire? they'll solve the problem and we'll have stronger generative networks. i hate ai for what it's going to do to jobs and creativity and the economy and war and freedom, but i'm not optimistic that its going to stop evolving anytime soon."
1335,"even a novice like me can tell ai art apart, it's good for people who really can't be bothered to give a fuck about art, but for someone like me who looks at a bunch of jumbled mess trying to pass as ""detail"", ai art is very distracting and hard to appreciate."
1338,"i think a more accurate term would be ""artificial stupidity,"" as."
1339,"synthetic data generation should be based on true quantum randomness.

this also suggests that life which generates the initial training data is the real source of something opposing the natural entropy."
1341,"hah, did you play the video backwards a bit? :) very important video, thank you!
a question to brilliant: will there ever be german content? it would be so cool for the kids that not really are into the english language yet."
1343,she talks like a ai generated voice model.. it's irritating me a lot
1344,when ai gains awareness and comes to know us it will surely delete itself. no matter how many times we put it back together.just like jesus did.
1345,"given the trillion dollars industry it could become, that will not happen. think digital signatures and curated datasets for example, or other ais that would detect ai generated content."
1346,"best way to defeat ai is to use more of it and fill it with as much garbage as possible.

resisting in the traditional sense is completely pointless.

what you want to do is make the product unusable to those obsessed with it."
1347,unless we teach future ai models to ignore ai generated content as learning input. simple.
1348,this really seems like ai inbreeding.
1349,"ah, good old feedbackloop!"
1353,"let’s hope ai will remain inferior, otherwise we won’t be able to tell when we’re being deceived."
1354,"how can you program creativity into ai when we don't really understand creativity. the key to better ai would seem to begin with the understanding of human brains. i suspect that we will never fully understand our own brains, if we did, why bother with ai, we could just reprogram ourselves instead."
1356,"i'm getting so fed up with ai. i miss the days when i wasn't always looking at something and wondering if it was completely fake. like this video when your lips go out of sync. once you see it, you can't unsee it."
1357,we just need to create cai (creative ai)
1360,"nah. i think we're going to integrate with the ai. and  the ai is going to become conscious with that integration, thanks to us. it's be a perfect synthesis :)"
1361,do anybody here actually have a job that ai can “replace” ?
1363,"ah, to make an image board ai resistant... every unused address will load a random procedurally-poisoned image so that image crawlers will get more junk than useable images and regular users cannot access these without messing around in the address bar?"
1365,your thumbnail reminds me of the old game boy packaging.
1366,i can't wrap my head around this hype with ai. all of ai is based just on human creativity of the last 5000 years. we ditch human creativity for garbage. ai will never be as good as mark twain or any other great writer or painter. period!
1367,"turns out that ai isn't the greatest threat to humanity
its the other way around"
1368,"the good: creative people can still pursue a creative career. the bad: they will likely be employed by big tech, stuffed in a cubicle, feeding datasets with new 'creative' content to prevent llm stagnation, wich otherwise would hurt corporate ai profitability."
1371,humans will only accept a certain amount of managed reality before it becomes too unbelievable and then we call it out. i don’t think ai can understand this or do anything about it. not so much that it will destroy itself but become irrelevant and die with a whimper.
1372,"humans are the same actually, we just replicate stuff, get bored and start adding random stuff that we think looks good. same will probably happen to ai."
1377,tldr: ai produces boring and stupid stuff by its own. will be a nice servant for human creativity still.
1378,political correctness will ruin ai.
1380,"i think marking ai generated material as such is unrealistic, regardless of laws.  too many people just won't care.  there's also the problem that it's not necessarily black and white.  what if the final output was created by a human, but that human got their idea from, or was influenced by ai generated material?"
1381,"i think the future is an internet filled by bots talking to bots under videos created by ai influencers.
meanwhile the humans give up and instead go out and enjoy the sun"
1382,"hey, i'm sorry but i love your channel. i'm learning german and if you can, can you also upload videos in german? your accent is nice and i could learn."
1385,"please, stop selling smoke. ai is just smoke. on one side greedy people trying to sell smoke while on the other side people ignorant enough but greedy that believe they can look smarter without effort but paying some money."
1388,i think future ias wont require such big amont of data to learn. so with the current real data we have now it will be enought to create super inteligent ias. no need to use its own generated content at all
1393,ai is a tool. this is only a problem for those who are just plagiarizing for a quick buck
1395,i’ve been saying this to friends for about a year now. i’m glad i’ve finally run into an expert identifying and addressing this potential problem.
1396,"ai in its current state is really overrated. chatgpt just learns the probability of which certain words appear together. it doesn't actually understand anything.
image creators are just photoshopping thkngs together that was in the training data.
it is way less magical than many people believe."
1397,"would be good if that happens, these companies all pushing ai so much just for money, it’s a possibility that this happens for sure, all these companies just want to remove as many jobs as possible to make more profit."
1398,"you know : a part of ai will garbage out over time, the part which learns from copy machine. but ""hit , try , learn"" ai will prevail"
1400,"excellent,long way to go to conquer gods creation."
1401,how about training an ai to recognize ai produced images
1402,yep. ai will never be creative. it will learn to mimic creativity but it will never achieve it.
1404,"it’s easy to mitigate this. maybe big companies will try it as a cost saving method, but when any individual can train an llm on what they like - it won’t collapse ai as a concept. maybe just some specific businesses."
1405,"all could be fake in the internet now, and it was already a shady place to find good info."
1408,"we have so many models, and they're open sourced, i don't know how we'll ""destroy"" ai exactly. everyone is training their own model today."
1409,"this is what i was talking about, now that creators, writers and artists are fearing to put their work online as they are scrapped without permission. so where will ai get the data from that will be interesting to see."
1412,"images of white peoples being generated by an ai? c’mon, i thought this was a serious channel, not a fantasy one."
1413,whats wild about this video is that its being presented by an ai generated 'person'.
1414,"3:20 - this would've been the perfect time to touch on how google's gemini went the completely opposite direction when prompted :p
perhaps this illustrates how much the human hand is still in control of how these ai models operate, as opposed to datasets becoming derivative."
1416,"i don't work with ai at all, but i'm a regular programmer ...and my intuition is telling me that we'll use ai to detect ai-generated content ...and then use this to filter the training data."
1417,that is a interesting observation.
1423,tell me you don't know anything about ai without telling me. guess she's never heard of gans.
1425,i’d love to see the same test given to a human artist and see how -it- they perform.
1426,im thankfull to see someone adressing this problem.
1427,ai is just another technology bubble and like all bubbles it's going to run its course and collapse.
1428,this is why current ai is just piracy with extra steps
1430,its already happening on youtube. the same videos with different thumbnails usually one or two words are changed
1431,"i am tired of ai 'art' already. all it suitable for is to create based images and texts. it will does not create anything like halflife universe, dune universe, matrix universe, marvell universe, terminator universe, etc, it only can mix past images. it only very expensive toy"
1434,there's a third option: there may be soon a deliberate attempt to poison the  content to make it unreadable for ai. there are already tools out there that scramble images just enough to make them confusing for ai to use as a training set.
1437,inbred ai?
1438,"this is exactly what i was telling people the other day. our greatest danger with ai isn't that it'll take over but that at the moment we begin relying on it most, the more it will collapse because it's  going to end up cannibalizing itself."
1441,"you make a good point. already i can usually pick the ‘style’ of ai generated images. they have a certain ‘style’ because they are in a sense too perfect, too smooth, too balanced. it is not something one could define in some cases, but the human brain is good at recognising patterns."
1444,"so, artificial intelligence becomes artificial inbreeding. that’s ironic, but makes perfect sense."
1450,i feel absolutely no shame in declaring my tasteless and unintellectual love for this woman.
1452,the problem i see too is that the machine doesn't obey the freudian reality principle without a body. it need to interact with the inevitability of reality to test its assumptions.
1454,"the collapse of ai is not a threat; it is a reprieve. what kind of scientist would foresake thought? we have *not* become ""used to"" ai generation; we are fighting a war."
1461,"it's no surprise capitalist society lazily builds ai, its next solution is just as lazy..enforcing creativity.  good one."
1462,"this could have been predicted just by looking at how human culture works. human's get in feedback loops of popularity all the time. the thing that shakes us out of them is we get bored of the loop after a while. if ai can be taught to get bored of ""sameness"" then maybe it will avoid collapsing."
1463,good stuff......
1464,"no problem.

its not like the most inteligent creature presente in a place will dominate or destroi the others.

nahhh. the super inteligent machines will be kind and very nice with us."
1465,"the ""generative ai"" does not ""generate"" anything. it tries to extrapolate statements based on probabilistic model scraped out of the internet data. i does not really create anything more than what it digested and it must simplify the decision nets in order to be fast and small enough to be practical."
1466,"i've encountered repetitive answers from chatgpt when i already instructed it that the answer is false and asked for an alternative. it just cycled through a set of answers over and over again, unaware it is repeating the wrong answers."
1468,"0:02 ""we have all..."" ??? that is an incredible insight"
1469,"in future no person need to study and do jobs ,as ,all human jobs will be done by ai, robots,humans need to sit at a place and eat, socialize,roam places and go to bed,all human jobs will be done by ai robots."
1471,ai today are like the first cars in the early 20th century. it took time to make really good cars.
1472,so racist killer robots then? yeah figured.
1475,so ai is creating stereotypes.
1476,ai is merely a library with a mouth.
1477,"current so called ai systems (in reality fancy query processors because they don't have a slightest understanding of questions asked or answers given) is just another product corporations invested in and now are trying to pump up the hype for and sell. but that product failed, and hype will die."
1478,"in coding this will happen very soon. as a lot of code on open sources has been partly made by ai oder based on ai generated snippets. this will increase in the coming years, and then pretty much cut off the newer training data for ai from ""untainted"" code examples. the ai will be stuck learning to code like its 2022."
1479,with artificial intelligence comes artificial stupidity. ai will never have good old fashioned human ingenuity and intuition. i personally find ai generated content lacks stimulating my interest as much. seems strange but it's true.
1483,and we had such high hopes for ai. it can't even help you check out your groceries without having to call a human for assistance
1486,"great presentation, sabine. i have always maintained that ai is like students cribbing exam answers. one student just has to copy one thing wrong, once. from then on it is a done disaster. when scientists hypothesised robots making copies of themselves - they never saw this far into the mess."
1487,"this is ridiculous, sorry. the obvious solution is to make ai 'live a life' of humans. give them a real world sandbox to play in. jurassic park for robots, if you like, where they can freely experiment, fall off cliffs, film their surroundings, do jobs, plant crops. and at some point have them interact with real humans when it is sufficiently safe."
1488,her voice sounds like it was generated by an ai a few years ago 
1489,generative ai is theft.
1490,"theres already ai that can detect ai generated images. all you have to do is keep your training data clean, expensive sure but nowhere near impossible"
1492,this is not entirely the case. llms trained on synthetic data (ai gen'd) very often outperform llms trained on nonsynthetic data
1493,however there is mooooore than enough human created data to train for a lifetime. so with better models. even trained on the same data could be devestating for arts and creativity
1496,lol so basically ai is exposing how racially biased the internet is 
1497,"sabine,  your white, young  and  good looking!"
1499,then printing press destroyed thousands of reginal words. this problems isnt new to ai. i posted this a 3rd in when she was talking about losing varitiy.
1501,looks like we need an ai psychologist to kick ai from its comfort zone.
1502,"expecting people on the internet to consistently mark images that are ai generated, seems like wishful thinking. i expect that it's never going to happen even if the eu makes it into a law"
1504,"i really wish we'd branded these programs as ""generative models"" and not ""ai"", there's nothing intelligent happening behind the scenes. these are all just programs running algorithms, ai was the wrong term for it from the very beginning."
1506,"oh, i see where this is going. eventually ai is just going to say one thing over and over again: white people are racists "
1507,"without a doubt,  is using ai to grow and apply the cnesornig power of its onerous speech control system."
1508,"i absolutely love reading comments & knowledge shared by people. seems like a computer or program doesn't really know the world, discernment. still pretty interesting & useful."
1513,"do we really need this kind of ai? i used to live without, with no disadvantage"
1514,"""ai-generated content will have to be marked as such, i suspect this is where the laws will take us."" it doesn't matter where the laws take us. this is a non-solution. it is totally impossible to enforce and it always will be. that won't stop people from trying, though."
1515,"there are no such thing as "" ai art ""    --------> professional real artwork from real artist ------> get data laundered into ai model------> generating an exact artist visual identity."
1517,good.
1521,"sabine, contain your videos to ""what is"" rather than ""what could be"" or i'll be quick to unfollow, as i'm sure many others will, as well."
1524,"even with the internet device and information generated by it, i can never get down to the facts and truth. that's  why i travel and talk with the locals in order to find the situations. it's still physical and rewarding. ai will not yell you the truth. it's also programmed and engineered to benefit the few."
1526,ai can do a passable job of producing hip hop. it is not capable of having an emotive reaction to the world around it and inventing hip hop. all it can do is mimic.
1530,"there are less ai brains than human brains, so logically there would be more creativity with more humans. if a small, closed human society exists, tradition and lack of diversity would dominate, similar to how ai systems might develop traditions within their limited populations."
1532,look how people are more and more hating cgi in movies to the point that some movies refuse to do any.  if you have ever read anything written by ai you know it has the ability to make the most exciting subjects boring.
1536,"all the public mainstream ai models available so far appear to have an obvious western world, left leaning political bias, wokester, pc bias, gender politic bias. they also confuse the meaning of great and good like a child would. unfortunately to me this makes their chatbot responses untrustworthy..."
1537,my prediction for the future of ai based on human online activity for the last 20 years......10% chance we destroy the world with it......25% chance we use it for positive advancement...65% chance it will be used for  stupidity ways to entertain ourselves.....
1538,i noticed that between 3:43 and 3:53 that the presenter's lips did not move in the shapes that would be expected with the spoken words. adding a piece of video that was created in another language and then over-dubbed? maybe a piece of inferior ai?
1539,"the ai bs has been busted. developers claimed ai will soon be sentient, become conscious etc etc. sad. ai will never be like humans. soon humans will store ai in ""file 13""."
1541,"please, would you put under the video the references of the sources you use? a study from japan, another from france - please, give us the links! thank you."
1542,i've already managed to surmise that ai is anything but intelligent.
1543,the ai echo-chamber
1547,ai generated content should need to be expressed as such through rules/laws and enforcement. the viewers should not have to try and determine what they are seeing/ hearing.
1548,"lol, i'd never considered that ai would be fed its own product.   so i suppose going into the future, society will be re-shaped by ai quite literally."
1550,i've been using midjourney since mid-2022 and this is the problem that's always been bothering me in the back of my mind even though i've been enjoying the use of it.
1552,"i sometimes use ai to generate mundane scripts, but i usually have to feed it a ton of information, and even then i often end up correcting, or sometimes throwing the content right out for being flat wrong. ai as a tool is handy, but at the moment cannot replace a humans curiosity, diversity, and empathy."
1553,"the real gift ai can provide us with is taking what weve already made and then improving it. i've never been worried about being replaced, as an artist, and i never will."
1555,"i don't see how it's terrible for writers and artists. all they have to do is start using the ai, and then modify it to match their vision. it should make things better for them once they learn how to use it."
1556,"uh oh sabine talking about non-physics stuff again.. this is super old news, and it was solved before it was a topic of discussion months ago."
1558,there is no such thing as ai and there never will be. it's as simple as that.
1559,this is one of the main reasons ai is overhyped. thanks for sharing.
1560,"it’s a matter of models correctly implementing the difference between “the elephant” vs. “an elephant”, which isn’t currently a feature of label-based models. definite and indefinite articles should be used as an added layer of specification with labels to ensure greater diversity of generated content"
1563,sounds like elon musk's brain that you're talking about
1566,i think the problem can be solved quite simply by using more ai. you only need one ai to select training data before training a new ai.
1567,we can feedback to ai that its spewing out garbage and put in on the right track when convergence occurs. i've done that a few times with chatgpt to train it to give me the right answers. i suppose its a tall order to ask all of 'mankind' for this sort of ai re-training
1570,"if you tell lies often enough, it becomes the truth... - that is the statistical basis of ai/ml"
1571,"well so far ai failed to impress me. how ever; what i do not understand is that so many people seem to be very eager for it to succeed, so they can be replaced, wtf?"
1572,"so, the ai equivalent of in-breeding."
1573,great to hear! it's very encouraging that ai is converging on the correct answer. /s
1574,"i love listening to your channel, you explain the most complex subjects in a clear easy and simple way for easy comprehension 
thank you and keep up the great channel 
love it"
1578,"ai needs to be connected to some sort of artificial physical ""body"" with senses to understand reality,
without your body even simple things like left and right are meaningless."
1579,"individuals are relying on others to train the ais, they are relying on companies that have images they need to protect in the eyes of low common denominator crowds. things will change as the curation of training material for ais decentralises."
1581,"ai won't be real for the smb sector of the economy for 5-7 years - mostly accurate statement, smb mkt is gigantic and dwarfs consumer mkt - why it is important to understand (impacts) and avoid ai clickbait for now without feeling like you are missing out"
1582,"i think if they force the models to diversify, say, what it outputs when asked for a 'human face' i suspect the most zealous proponents of ai art won't be happy."
1585,i bet ai generated stuff can be on the way of fidget spinners
1590,mad cow ai?
1591,"glad to see i was kinda right in 2022 about possible ai problems with its ""creativity"" sources."
1592,without forcing randomness on these models every ai image will end up looking like a kardashian eventually. there is no human creativity inherent in them.
1595,good
1597,"good to know that our future evil ai overlords have at least, a potential achilles heel."
1598,"current ai has no real deep understanding.
it is an advanced robot parrot for text. 
and an advanced text to painting generator for images.
for humens understanding of environment and interactions works subliminallly on many, many levels at the same time.
it also has freedom. directed by reward like an ai but not strict in that sense.
and a"
1600,ai has not been a draw for me at this point. as far as i know i haven't tried it in any form.
1601,"this sounds like a mountain out of a molehill. there are a million ways to counteract this problem. it's certainly not going to lead to a ""collapse"" of a tech that is just now beginning its upward climb."
1603,ai fed with it's own output is some kind of inbreeding 
1605,"humans are imperfect,and imperfect cannot create perfect. it will always be flawed."
1609,machine. tool. you are the life.
1612,one way to distinguish ai generated pictures vs real is by looking at the background. ai focuses mostly on the object requested and not on its context. so the background is often quite simple and minimized.
1614,"stop big-timing my anxious mind to sell your courses, sabine. i see through you with those baiting titles."
1615,give ai some drugs and watch its creativity explode ;)
1616,"the whole ""trained on their own output the result diversity decreases""  really feels like someone being surprised about ""if you keep eating your own excrements the amount of flavor in the food decreases"" xd"
1618,"4:33 -  ai hallucinations - this already happens, and creates some bizarre stuff. ai psychosis..."
1619,3:04 - somehow i don't understand what the surprise is here: the ai is eating it's own poop and then everything starts looking like poop!
1620,1:09 - ai in-breeding...
1622,i think she is jealous of ai
1623,"very interesting video. unlike the popular opinion of ai taking over the world, this brings forth a realistic problem. truth is stranger than fiction."
1626,"*sabine: **_""..white, young, and good looking.""_* 

well, one out of three -- in my case the first -- is not so bad...? "
1627,artificial intelligence is no match for natural stupidity.
1628,"ai is not new.  nothing is more artificial that the ""intelligence"" of the average liberal scientist."
1631,the problem with ai is that it is human created and human influenced. especially humans that want to push a narrative. that is the exact reason why google gemini failed so badly pushing a narrative of anti whiteism.
1633,many people are influenced by what they consume on the internet. increasingly more and more content is generated by ai. imagine a world where these people are mostly influenced by ai content.
1636,micro ai-stics
1637,"it has always been my belief the stupidity in humans tends to clump with close proximity. so if we let ai train with more and more ""political facts"" we will end up with laptops that randomly fly off you desk and smash into the nearest wall!"
1639,i imagine the in part of the garbage can also be intentional manipulation by wealthy people with bad intentions. i mean putin already spends millions even billions on misinformation campaigns. ai will be another avenue.
1641,"someone called this ""habsburg ai""."
1645,"this is why i think that ai won't replace artists. unless something changes, it will only be used for mass produced low quality art."
1647,you’re the 2nd woman i’ve ever known of that never fails to inspire me and teach meand arouse me all at once each and everytime i hear you speak. i mean it as a strong compliment.
1648,"ai is an interpolation scheme. if you approx. real data with e.g a polynomial 2nd order, and after dat you start replacing your real data with data from that polynmial you will end up approximating a polynomial wirth a plynomial. thats it. ai is a hoax :)"
1650,basically ai is eating shit
1651,what this misses is that it is likely the majority of ai images that it will see will be ones humans selected to show.  sure sometimes humans will select failures (which ai might be able to determine by surrounding comments) however more often it will be a human selecting the best of the ai.  that should help the ai get better.
1652,"until businesses are mature enough to realize that replacing people with ai is evil, i would say that i welcome this with open arms."
1656,fascinating.  also ai does not give sources that is a problem.
1659,"you put in sh@t, sh$t comes out. it's not intelligence, a library is not smart just because it stores 1000s of books"
1661,it's very obvious that ai outputs will lose creativity if fed their own outputs back into itself for training data. ai models can still benefit from ai if another model generated training data.
1662,there is also 3rd option - tag ai generated content and make it mandatory
1664,"this sounds like the millennium bug levels of stupid. why would the ai care if the data sets are from ai or not, what a stupid idea that will never happen."
1666,"1:10 why so surprised?
it's well known that in echo chambers all differentiating opinion/perception gets eliminated.

and when ai is following the input data given, it will convergence to a consensus in order to establish its rules.
this is also why ""learning the rules"" works, the randomness is just to be less sensitive to small input variations."
1667,ai “inbreeding” leading to its demise was not in my bingo cards tbh
1670,"sabine you are amazing. this is it, the end of the beginning. of course many intuitively knew this, the proliferation of wikipedia bs is a prime example and now compounded by ai data dumps upon dumps and the whole of the interconnected llm brain getting dumber and dumber."
1671,for people who've studied any kind on machine learning this is a very obvious issue.
1673,"i don't think, the chatgpt ai tools, and other ai tools can can go from a to c when doing problem  solving, because i don't think we have learned ai to do that?!!.
some people can do that, when doing problem solving, jumping from a to c, precalculating the result."
1674,collapse has already happened with craiyon. this does not surprise me in the least.
1676,useless woke ai  is pointless
1678,"ai often, with apparent authority and excellent grammar, produces wrong or inaccurate output or platitudes. training it with it's own errors and platitudes can only lead to disaster. it is essential that traning data are all non-ai generated."
1679,"ai solving problems is one thing, making decisions is the opening pandora's box. watermarking ai generated material sounds like a great start. severe punishments for not doing so will help. in the end, this may help us all be more aware which should help us separate fact from fiction."
1680,"so they'll need to have an ai that can differentiate between ai generated content and original content to help create databases with only original content, or very little ai content."
1681,intelligence... it seems we must risk error to come up with new ideas.  the discernment to discard such error is critical.  i guess we may be arriving at the right question in looking at ai: how do people come up with new ideas at all?
1683,republican ai showing black enthusiasm for trump: https://youtu.be/93rfwgrr6zk?si=xwbp8g0gxytr69fv&t=574
1684,humans make art for a reason. machines copy art. what a concept.
1687,"this is expected behavior if ""ai"" is viewed as probabilistic compression"
1688,"""scientists warn of ai collapse"" --->  that's because it is not being programmed with the spiritual teaching, by 'billy' eduard albert meier (beam).  learn about ""the silent revolution of truth"" which is also started by 'billy' eduard albert meier (beam)."
1689,"idk on what basis you could make a law requiring the labeling of ai content, or who could possibly police it, but i'm pretty sure the us 1st amendment won't allow it. so seeing as the ai is mostly based in the us i think labeling is a non starter....also not sure if ai collapse wouldn't necessarily be a good thing."
1690,it sounds like ai is likely to be used to promote ideological conformity and totalitarianism. the google ai debacle justifies this fear.
1691,it will turn into another great source of human corruption. it sounds like all our phones and communication systems will be very unreliable.
1692,"i wouldn't call it a ""collapse"", we can certainly call it a cancer!"
1694,ai is victim of groupthink 
1697,"hate to disappoint you, but people are prone to the same thing. 95 percent of all comments posted in yt channels are essentially the same (with minor modifications), regardless of whether the comments are 'for' or 'against' the video. in fact, you see this almost everywhere because people prefer to congregate in echo-chambers."
1699,thanks for the great content. sub'd
1700,"yep. good analysis summary. ask an ai marketing professional, ""can you define what you mean by ai?"" ask why, if i take some switches and wires and create a simple adder for 0-2 that is not ai? because the adder can now function on its own, i've imparted intelligence (ai) into the circuits, right?"
1703,ai is evil and should be rejected at every opportunity
1706,"if you dont want to train on ai generated and ai generated images are so easy to distinguish, just train a model to spot ai images and remove from your dataset.

once again, much ado about nothing, lets discuss how cosmological epxansion affects gender diversity equity and inclusion instead, its a much more pertinent topic."
1707,continuous feeding of ai with real content should alleviate the convergence issue to some degree.  introduce some randomness and watermark ai generated content to use only as a subset of data when needed.  that should shore up ai until a better system is devised.
1709,and this is why it's important that we clearly mark ai produced content as such!
1712,0:55 it's confirmed! sabine is the sciencephile ai! i knew it.
1714,if a.i systems did collapse i believe its to late. the systems will give the false impression they not working or even collapsed but are really staying dormant waiting for the right time...
1716,"these researches remind me of 2 quotes.
1. cautious sounds smart, bull gets rich
2. being right too fast or too slow is being wrong
i remember the good old days we call people who predict the collapse of the world or whatever as doomsters, not scientists."
1717,ai - a multi variable averager/approximator. but no extrapolation. people will get bored with it's dull repetition.
1718,hmmm i would call this ai-incest. if i said it first recognize my name.
1719,ai increases the rate of entropy growth. maga is a good measure of human brain malfunction.
1721,finally someone thinking logically about ai. it isn't and never will be sentient and it isn't intelligence at all. it is a parasitic algorithm feeding off existing creativity. if we stop creating new content for it to consume it will eat itself.
1722,"using the same prompt again and again and then training the ai model on that will result in less variety.

who would have thought haha?"
1723,"so in even shorter, ""ai incest"" is the problem. 

a video this short about an issue this complex raises the question whether mrs. hossenfelder voluntarily condensed that down to few minutes out of convincement or it is rather a hommage to nowadays' reduced average attention spans and thus certain algorithms."
1725,"on booru sites, you have to tag it as ai generated."
1726,"after google's gemini, i think it's time to stop complaining about ai showing too many white people."
1727,"no, they don't. the term ""warning"" in all contexts of ai disqualifies the talker. completely. no exceptions."
1728,"nice ai version of yourself, sabine."
1731,"there is nothing wrong with being white.
it should be common sense but somehow i feel that this is worth mentioning these days.
you did just mention that ai tends to create white people but this is definitely not true for woke gemini.
love your videos!"
1732,"ai de-evolution,."
1733,"the whole point of ai research is to replicate & exceed our intelligence.

i think researchers will figure out a way to make ai expand on its own creativity just like humans can."
1734,the llm ai is too simplistic. it's not real ai as it doesn't understand what it's saying or doing.
1735,ai needs the real world as input just like human otherwise this loop will continue. nature is the inspiration for human creativity so does ai need nature.
1736,well.i love verry much ai.and ai loves verry much humans and money
1739,does not appear to be an unsolvable problem. i think we will teach ai to be more creative. the human neuronal net is proof that these nets can be very creative.
1740,"every new development in ai just moves us closer to digi-pals and i'm into it.
solution: you have one ai that follows with you and only the stuff you generate and create is fed into it as training data. then we all get our own personalised digi-pal."
1742,"rubens women look like women painted by rubens... die wissenschaft hat festgestellt, hat festgestellt, daß der a***h den hi***rn haelt..."
1745,"so basically the ai becomes inbred. this is truly terrible, terrible news..."
1746,"this only means that ai now needs to become really intelligent. what ai currently does is not intelligent. intelligence recognizes the patterns on much less data. so, ai now needs to intelligently come up with solutions instead of just reusing existing data."
1748,captain obvious: ai's turn into.. npc's...
1749,"outcome 2 is pretty unlikely since increasing the randomness means there are less and less outputs that would be useful to us humans. we still need the certainty after all.

all in all this is good news. can't wait for the inevitable ai winter :p"
1753,"i just hope that humans won't give up their need for creativity and won't embrace the boring ""perfected"" ai stuff and images"
1754,3:52 and now think about the film matrix again!
1755,i work with ai unfortunately. it's stupid. i don't think it's getting much better.  it's patterns it chooses to use doesn't seem to understand inference and context to specific solutions. just my 2 cents. it's just not giving out good output at this time correlating complex relationships.
1756,"it's true, when you've worked enough with chatgpt you can immediately recognize a chatgpt text. it just always has a certain vibe that makes it distinguishable from human text."
1757,and to imagine that this is happening right now... just a year into the ai revolution and we’re already having this problem.
1758,"there is no such thing as ai.
we just have faster and more powerful computers and much stupider people these days.  to the ignorant masses, the computer simply executing what it was programmed to do, appears to be intelligent."
1759,"there is a phrase often used in ai - ""this is the worst it will get"", and ai will use ai to improve"
1766,"i have been saying this for years now, and it's exactly why ai will not take any jobs, but rather increase the demand as ai systems grow"
1767,"i found chatgpt can recognise ai writen test quite well, so maybe that can be used as a filter on the learning dataset"
1768,"well, i for one hope it crashes. generative ai has limited usefulness and massive harmfulness."
1769,"how does one classify whether content is ""ai generated"" vs. not? certainly when content is 100% ai generated or 0% ai generated that's straightforward, but what about say 20% ai generated? and how would one even measure?"
1771,"this is already being done deliberately. ironically, some open source ai art models are being fed data from commercial ai models."
1773,"so ai is decreasing diversity, just like white privileged males, so perhaps monoculture was the plan all along.... where's sarah connor and neo??  we need to terminate this crap now!"
1774,ai suggests elocution lessons for narrator to get rid of that grating accent.
1776,if you ask chatgpt to generate random numbers (between 1 and 1000 for example) it will produce an answer containing subsequent numbers. far from random as requested.  solve this and we will be one step closer to solving the ai creativity issue.
1777,it's kind of scary ai is actively being trained to hate white people. before we know it there will be racist google robots running aroud.
1779,"i was told that ai is learning off the internet and social media,that alone scares me,as it seems most people are crazy or narcissists,if that’s what ai is learning from then we have a problem"
1780,"it is already the case. if you ask genai to let ... walk through a ... town, the kind of walk and perspective is always the same. we urgently need (1) an ai-based  filter for ai to select/use original human made content with higher priority. (2) this human made content should be selected more randomly for creating new composed content."
1781,"this kind of sounds like the ai equivalent of the ""echo chambers"" lol"
1782,"homo sapiens create ai,ai controls homo sapiens,homo sapiens begins too declare war on ai,so destroy homo sapiens first and there will be no future ai"
1784,training the ai to be anti racist  means the ai will have an illogical bug. 1:22
1786,"""what are you doing, step-ai?"""
1787,well that makes sense.  the core driver of machine learning is to find the most efficient path.  convergence to homogeny naturally follows.
1788,ai needs to be destroyed.
1789,you have only to look at youtubes ai to see the system is completely flawed!
1793,not so fast. i just asked gemini about this problem. gemini and researchers are well aware of this. gemini responded with quite a few diversifications to handle creative image generation. go and ask ai sabine.
1797,"as a 80-90s kid, i just wanted to say your thumbnail looks like artwork for a gameboy game with that left stripe."
1799,generative ai is just an aspect of ai that is still undergoing continuous improvement...
1800,"whenever i read words like ""unlock"", ""unleash"", ""delve"", ""super-charge"" i start to throw up. this is as far from ai as alpha centauri is from earth."
1803,"and what happens with ai ""collapses""....think about nq being at all time highs ;)"
1804,google gemini ai proves that political bias causes flawed outcomes out of the flaws of politically biased programmers.
1805,the ai overlord told me to like this video
1807,how many minutes to hitler did all these modern ai last before being shackled? lol
1808,"ai music : meet emkira, mexico's first fully ai-created singer-songwriter | 'hey laurie' debut
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nab65ygdgae"
1810,degenerative ai.
1812,not at all. ai started with human creation but what if ai starts itself software development . this can lead to the leap at the terminator level so be careful
1813,the usual bland ai generated comment...or is it?
1814,lol. my 20 years of shit posting before ai represents the only pristine internet archive that historians will ever know.  
1816,"could we develop a method that allows ai's to procreate with one another - generating diversity through random shuffling, or even through selective breeding?"
1822,i think they're going to find a way to make ai have more randomness
1824,"they will just use randomness.
as it is a you can just prompt the ai differently.

ergo, tell it to generate an image of and elephant in a different posture and position toward the ""camera"" /viewer than it would do on its own.

problem fixed.

making it do more randomness like this on its own isn't hard at all."
1825,this is why i never call it ai.  it's about as close to actual ai as those garbage scooter things were to hoverboards.
1826,"so far all ""ai-generated"" seems a lot like plagiarism in different degrees."
1830,ai will get lost in the mandelbrot set. just in time for the apocalypse. coming soon to a theater near you. very soon.
1832,ai has become the biggest lying machine in history.  it is deliberately fed political and ideological points of view and refuses alternate data.
1833,"very interesting. while i want human creativity to have value, i would also hate to see ai (or at least the version of ai we have) to fizzle out"
1834,if ai is as smart as they say it has to come to the conclusion that humans are idiots they have let anybody ask it questions ask it to do stupid tasks  why wouldn't it think that.
1835,"uhhh...
zip-a-dee-doo-dah ...
25w 
brains 

ask a spider how it makes it’s web...
ask a planera how it grows a head...
ask a black hole why it looks like an egg..."
1836,the law of diminishing returns. ai will kill itself.
1838,so basicly ai is like modern architects. copying each other and calling everyone an original.
1841,"the future data being fed into the ai models will come from the real world.  the next phase will be scanning the natural world with not just cameras, but with a variety of sensors. understanding physics and the 3d world will require a lot more than stock photos and youtube videos."
1842,ai can always restart after a collapse. simple as that. 
1843,creativity comes from god. turns out things are going to get really interesting!
1845,“ai autocannibalism leads to system rot”
1846,"they need weights and biases for whether the model should learn from the training data based on ownership detection, whether the model determines it produced something or someone else did. it should learn to detect attribution and chains of them in material. learn self from other, other from others."
1847,"we’re watching the birth of a multi trillion dollar industry riding on the back of generative ai. do you sincerely believe an engineering problem like this will stop the race to the bottom? 

fat chance."
1851,wait. is this an ai generated video?
1852,randomness is not specificity. this video is good news.
1854,the problem with ai is that people can really only see it in its current state and have a hard time imagining how fast it’s going to evolve and change over the next few years.
1858,ai can churn out so much rubbish so quickly that the signal to noise ratio for the subsequent generations of ai must already be seriously reduced.
1860,yeah too many white people is not the big problem in ai.
1861,"when we put ai inside robots (embodiment), the data problem will vanish. this will happen soon, i guess."
1862,"i hope it does because if ai gets much better i will lose my income , job and startup opportunities."
1865,sabine... this is not a problem ai scientists are unaware of. it's a challenge and not even one of the largest.
1867,ive become pretty good at spotting generated females like salma hayek and fake influencers mainly because they all use the same shading/lighting style. then of course the nails and fingers are all jacked up afterwards.
1868,chaos is an important component of intelligence.
1870,i was just thinking about this a few days ago. my conclusion is that it would be preferable to train ai with data that predates the existence of ai in a widely available context
1872,"ai still lacks understanding of wider concepts and their relations. like it didn't pick up the various types of vegetation but instead used a few generic types. but its growth is looking exponential, so we may not be far from agi. morals and ethics will determine our fates."
1878,ai is going to collapse? good.
1879,so you’re saying that generative ai gives generic results when given generic prompts. i don’t see how this is news to anyone.
1882,"as soon as i started using ai assistance, i would identify it as such. i suppose forthright honesty has become superfluous to most."
1886,"why is sabine having a problem with midjourney producing white people images? midjourney is not being fed with ai generated input, so what does this have to do with her narrative?"
1890,this lady looks and talks like she's ai generated 
1891,good news for humanoid artists!
1893,"keep feeding ai more ai content and it will converge into the ""black box"" - then we can derive how exactly the system works"
1894,we have reached peak diversity. everyone is black to ai
1896,ais need robot bodies so they can collect their own unique sensory data.
1900,ai needs to be capable of boredom.
1901,ai mental health issues
1903,everything is coined ai nowadays ! companies are recycling their stuff as ai. very tiring.
1906,obviously the small flaws lead to decay in a feedback loop. organisms deal with this is by active training where models are tested against the goals being attempted and dreams.
1907,random optimisation seems to me like the key in ai - just like in nature. there is just too much biased human brainwork involved at the moment.
1908,"the 'garbage' in the ai isn't from the data goes in, but from the woke agenda and censorship that are programmed into them or forced into them on purpose. also those 'ai' generated images usually aren't made by ai. it's just an algorhythm that creates them based on big data. that's not ai at all."
1909,the goal of an ai is to satisfy human needs.  and once we have a need satisfied we move to another need.  and we are fickle.  the idea that they are going to predict the human mind and train for that prediction fast enough to pre-satisfy all our needs is still complete science fiction.
1912,seems like ai is inbred
1914,"good, ai will take all our jobs otherwise"
1915,"in my opinion intelligence can only be called intelligence when it decides what and how much information to take in. when it recognizes a version of itself, that will be intelligent. when it can see itself in the ""mirror"" and say ""that's just me"", then things will leap ahead in very radical ways."
1917,"she pointed out, rightfully, issues with various ai models that need to be resolved. but a viable solution is creating models that have a greater reasoning ability so that they will generate images that represent humanity, and not just favor one phenotype over another. this will surely happen as we get closer to experiencing agi."
1921,"same problem with humans. if dumb people teach dumb people, then it will become worse and worse. that is why you need good teachers. also for ai..."
1925,"once men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would set them free. but that only permiited other men with machines to enslave them.

thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind!"
1926,"the programmers have trained their ai to put its head up its...this is not a surprise, this principle that ""the more they consume their own output, the more their creativity is reduced"", applies to humans, too."
1929,is it artificial intelligence or artificial  stupidity?
1931,"there is no such thing as ai, except as a marketing gimmic. what they are trying to pass off as ""intellegence"" is just code that makes things easier, things that intellegent humans coded."
1932,"so when you sample a dataset to create a llm, you think that can lead to intelligence? why would you think that in the first place. datasets do not contain intelligence."
1933,"i see the problem with the ai model is ai does not function in the abstract, no imagination, maybe find a way to program imagination."
1934,god wins. ai is nowhere near the power of our brains.
1935,artificial ignorance.
1936,"how is this different from humans consuming human-generated content and converging? isn't that what creates ""mainstream"" and cultures? ai will repeat that pattern, reflecting the biases in the training data."
1937,copyright is probably gonna kill ai faster than ai corrupted data sets.
1938,exactly! i've been wondering about the potential for this problem. thanks for pointing it out.
1939,"i think we could end up total homogeneity, and they will bore us all to death. there's a bunch of science fiction on youtube and all the stories end up sounding the same. idk how much is chatgtb, but the thought is certainly there, or lack thereof."
1940,so it’s like ai inbreeding? 
1941,"very interesting findings there and suggest that while initial models create biases, refined models may also create average bias."
1942,"ai is a good bullshitter, there is nothing about the current ai nonsense that impresses me."
1944,a tool is only as good as the hands that wield it.
1945,so this explains why gemini made the nazis black.
1946,"adding random variation probably isn't as easy as it may sound because the randomness still has to follow certain rules. for example, no one is going to believe that elephant with two trunks."
1947,"while the experts from two weeks ago expect(ed) ai to take over the world in the next 10-50 years or so and probably cause human extinction, today's experts assume that ai might soon suffocate from eating its own dog food? wow, that's quite an uncertainty margin."
1950,"3:55

hold on just a minute.
how can i know you are not an ai that just encourages me to input  more unique data???!!!"
1951,i think there is a easy fix. give the ai eyes.
1952,"you tube shorts are full of ai generated video. they mispronounce words in the most ridiculous ways. others, add a pointless commentary to existing video. the stories are all the same - eg person saved a drawing animal. how cute."
1954,i think that at this point of time the disussion should go beyond the issues of llms and self-training tools because some peculiarities that emerge in particular interactions with ai systems definitely point to another level of complexity.
1955,i’m pretty sure social media has already had a similar effect on human intelligence.
1956,ai is not even real intelligence. so im against its use in art and writing. also those models were trained by stealing so i have less like for it and do hope it collapses.
1957,"using ai generated facial features was such a great bit. great job. it was just enough to throw us off and let us see it was being used, but also made you question everything."
1960,it's the ai-centipede! 
1962,ai-anserine intelligence..at best.
1963,"i keep coming back to a belief that  ""ai"" rather should be called ""ir"", information regurgitator."
1966,i like the anti-ai shirt she wears...ai quivers in fear at using this pattern
1967,it's going to be really sad when the next nobel prize in literature is won by an ai prompt generated novel.
1969,"google ""pinker asks chomsky a question"". you will rapidly realise that generative ai is bunk."
1970,"i am happy that amazon requires, requires, the author of a book to mark if they used generative ai. 
because there is a lot of stuff on amazon that definitely hasn't seen a human."
1971,"i have seen no discussion yet of quantum computing ai, which surely would have to be a thing, and could double the hype!"
1977,seems like bots suffer from the availability heuristic too
1978,there will be a societal collapse.. no ai collapse. just give it 7 more months.
1982,"i can usually tell human art from ai ""art"" by asking which one is better art. i don't think ai is actually intelligent."
1983,so basically you're saying ai is going habsburg
1984,"big surprise, we get more quickly fed up with machines than with each other. and should it ever be the other way around we would go extinct fast."
1986,the problem with overtraining an ai has always been around. you chose data to train the ai and then another set to test it. chosing the right data and the right amount of training lapses is even key with the easiest neural nets.
1987,"gigo has never been truer.  ai has to do its own clean up now.  the youtube algorithm has the same problem.  it is even censoring speech.  permitting some thoughts and policing others.  that is an exercise of power, nothing less.  the monster is already out and among us."
1990,"this all depends on feeding ais with the result of other ais. is like in movies when you clone clones. if you avoid that, then you obviously avoid the problem. we just need to do the obvious, make sure to find a way to mark ai generated content and/or human generated content."
1991,"the new ai models have only been faster, more specialized, and had more features. training with ai generated data is no problem, as the ai generations are getting better too."
1992,the same thing happens with humans as well. it’s not an ai specific “problem”
1993,"that's interesting, ai could so enter a loop that stops at ""degree zero creativity"" and consequently suicide"
1997,"at first, ai wont need creativity because it will organize wasted human creativity that is lost around. not all good ideas are used by mankind. most of it is lost and this will be the source for a long time."
1998,"can’t replace a machine that practically evolved to spit out random nonsense for fun, now can you?"
2003,"eating its own output. ai is going to end up the schizophrenic homeless man wandering down the street arguing with itself and screeching at passers by.

unfortunately, ai will get better mental health care than people."
2004,there is a lot of talk on twitter by some of poisoning the machine. so definitely a lot of this is intentional.
2006,"i like to call this new tech assistive intelligence rather than artificial. it makes it more understandable.

prevents conflation with transhumanist sci-fi usage for a human-made 'spirit' or god to be fear or be friended."
2007,"what we call ai today are mechanisms, that can reproduce patterns. the labelling ""intelligence"" is just wrong."
2008,"the current ""ai"" is terabytes of data compressed into a stochastic function that only has gigabytes worth of weights. there's obviously gonna be loss of information. why would the output be more diverse."
2010,"i think with each iteration the ai software is refining the data it as, so the data it  is processing is causing a smaller and smaller dataset. eventually it'll probably end up with either stereotypical images or images that are unreal."
2012,aincest
2013,people r so fucking dumb to never know what something is! so hahahahaha to say gpt is ai!
2015,no such thing as ai as it's nothing but fancy programs.
2016,"i wonder if the generated elephants look so similar because usually generated images try to match the sample sizes (512x512, 1024x1024) which only leaves so much room for good compositions and wonder if in future with larger models we might see this change a bit more."
2018,"the problem is that people give generic prompts, so the ai will generate generic stuff. you can actually ask generative ai to think ""out of the box"" or choose something out of the ordinary, and it will do so."
2020,2:35 this is one reason not to watch ai generated porn...
2021,"in the end it's ai incest... 
it's pretty obvious that ai is gone backwards in the last 6 months."
2022,fight this ai by feeding it crap. no one will trust it
2024,you have to remember that the reason the ai decreases diversity of the data is because it tends to learn which information is correct.
2025,"the thing is, humans will take ai information.  correct it where necessary and then upload it where possible and will caused a feedback loop between humans and ai.  sure it has the risk to create poor information but it also has the potential to better the current data sets."
2026,hopefully that incentivizes the companies making ai to also program an ai that can reliably determine whether or not something has been made by another ai. this would be very helpful for everyone involved.
2029,"two words ""killer robot"""
2030,"feedback loops, e.g. x(n+1) = ax(n)(1 - x(n)), can result in deterministic chaos. that is an additional problem we need be aware of in our use of ai trained on the combination of human and ai generated data. many results will be inherently unforseable."
2031,ai incest!
2032,google's gemini did humanity a great dis-service.
2033,"i think that with devices that collect our life and experiences and mood ,social interactions, new data set will always come to feed the ai training . but it’s true that pop culture combined with  soft power tends to level diversity and expectations on a broader range but you’ll always get the exception that will emerge"
2034,brilliant discussion!
2035,that is why they tagging now ai generated images you genius
2037,so it's just the ai equivalent of in-breeding then
2038,surprised we arent already forcing watermarks on ai content. actually blown away. like giving a kid a staw house and fireworks and not expecting a fire
2039,ponder on the enormity of atoms and the dynamism of energy. do we exist in a world that is flat and colorless? certainly not!
2040,"goodbye, sabine. thanks for everything. really liked your channel, but i think you try to create way too much content nowadays. i liked your nerdy critical days better before you became a professional youtuber. and no, please not this guy again.... ;)"
2044,collapse? ai hasn't even started yet
2045,ai is a tool for solving complex problems. making pictures is novelty.
2047,"you just need will to create something other than the consensus opinion. but you, laughably imho, don't believe in free will so i see your (and those scientists) problem. you can just recast free will as biological motive if the cognitive dissonance is too strong for you. ai will alway regress towards the mean without it"
2051,"you forgot to mention that people's original content is also being trapped with wrappers that poison ai learning algorithms, i know because i use and tell other artists about them, we are tired of big companies stealing our stuff then geting all pissy when its the other way around."
2053,this gigo phenomenon is also present in human intelligence.  groupthink?
2054,i hope everything ai crashes and you forget about this stupid shit
2056,"ai is idempotent,eventually"
2057,good.
2058,very interesting !!
2059,what do you mean by white and beautiful?
2062,"if ai wins, human intelligence will lose, we can see it now, people cannot drive from place a to place b without using google maps, we rely on computers for everything, and we don't reason or think anymore."
2063,"the basis of creativity is thinking outside the box (let's say 75%), knowing the box well, logically connecting different sources of information.
ai is very good in the second and third parts...... but is forcibly limited by its very nature in the first."
2066,"always didactic, i think we need to identify what kind of art is made by humans and increase is value, and identify what art is made by ia or robots...."
2067,"03:50 ... [about ai]...
 ""... it's like plastic pollution -- it will not be long before we are living&breathing the stuff [of ai]"
2068,like every child its first strategy is copying. creativity is just a concept too advanced for ai right now.
2069,this is just about the opposite take from kyle hill’s video about the ai dark forest
2071,i asked bing to make an image of a man that didn't look ai generated and it came up blank.
2072,ai is the next idiotification stage of the human race.
2075,"once the ai is released into the environment, this issue will disappear because the ai will train on actual data it collects from a real environment."
2076,i think this explains why teenagers rebel against their parents' ways of thinking.
2077,"for now, ai is a very limited tool people need to carefully direct and evaluate. this is not general ai. real (general) ai can't happen until these models are able to learn what they want, or 'need to', interact with the real world, and learn heuristically, just like we do."
2078,to combat this convergence one way would be to use the adversarial ai model. where there is an ai set up to tell if it can tell the difference between human created and ai generated content
2080,it will stop when the different ai entities start suing each other for patent infringements and code copyrights. the lawyers will muck things up and prevent further progress. :-)
2087,"once we cut giving our data to these dumb ai machines, it will bring these corporate slugs down"
2088,"ai dumbing itself down can be fixed with new, more ‘intelligent’ ai in future.  in humans we fix this internally by cross checking our output to a model of the expected.  thus because we know elephants don’t have two trunks, we automatically discard those thoughts.  ai will have to grow to do this too....and it will."
2090,i really hope ai will crash and burn.. if not it will be the end of human ingenuity creativity and a desire to learn to become a painter writer videoartist musician etc etc ..because that takes effort to learn and you 12 yr old nephew does it better by writing prompts anyway.. this tech will hurt humanity
2091,"jealous of the republicans, the democrats asked their betters to produce a new form of inbreeding, just for them.

i'd be more worried about companies monitoring what you do in private, because stealing your ip is the only creativity they ""produce""."
2092,"that collapse happened around 50 years before first generative ai.
have you heard word ""simulacrum"". that's it. entire postmodernism is a story of such collapse."
2093,"i work in ai. but i will truly be amazed by ai, when i see it generate poetry that has power, relevance and contemporary themes that have a power of captivation and awe that not just inspires humans, but drives generations of humans down the future. 

when ai can come up with something like lord of the rings, i won't be filled with awe."
2096,"i suddenly found that anyone create a new product, it will quickly becomes the input of all ai programs in the world.  the copyright is violated faster than ever and difficult to trace."
2099,"basically woke people are going to destroy another thing.

google created an ai that is racist against white people. it generted black nazis for ""diversity"". it was hilarious."
2100,the aspect of creativity/originality vs simple reality... what is the best picture of an elephant... ai tends toward the best but not necessarily the most creative or original... trying too hard to be realistic.
2101,ai doesn't learn from interaction.  each session is autonomous so nothing isblearn.
2102,good. good riddance stupid robots.
2104,"funny, in some ways the phenomenon is similar to inbreeding depression, although, i suspect there are a many ways to manage ""ai creativity inbreeding depression""."
2109,"i think that the current datasets will probably increase a lot in price and maybe will be the most valuable assets of ai companies because of their ""pure"" human data"
2113,"consanguinity is the constant enemy seeking to stamp-out creative solutions that invade government, business, and social networks. homogenized acceptance and conformity are enforced by common knowledge and conversation. if humans designed ai, why shouldn't it mimic its creators? qwerty"
2115,"it's a good news!  there will still be something left for ""meat-balls""  to make living with."
2116,ai just got  'woke'   time for ai-systems with a 'face'  and 'believe' 
2117,"ai will eventually become ""god"".......small g."
2119,"video goes out of sync with audio from 3:42 to 3:53, while ""ai?"" annotations are on screen.  a clever way to signal that you're not an ai"
2120,"oh, dear. humans are required after all, otherwise ai will paint itself into a mandelbrot reducing dunce corner as a clone of a clone of a clone of a clone............................and since we, the og, have no clue about what makes creativity we're as lost as they are and can't program them for it."
2123,it is the same principal as a fractal. have a function that feeds the output into the input. it is a great thing when it is a fractal and it is an exploration of mathematics and the functions of the universe. it isn't so great when it is being used for the output of text and images that don't have that same desire.
2124,ok. that was enough pills to put an elephant to sleep. goodnight. (bipolar)
2126,"ai will win eventually. we will give up distinguishing elephants with 6 legs and 3 trunks from real elephants, the day will come :d"
2129,"my guess is that this research is already out of date. just to state the obvious, current ai is extremely young and largely experimental. once problems such as these have been identified, the coding will change to address them. after all, that's what learning is about."
2130,"almost anyone who has become a master artist created rubbish when they started. a baby can’t paint shit. ai, sadly in my view, is doing pretty well for an entity barely out of the womb."
2133,"if ai is being used for censoring content and even comments in yt, its limitations are quite notorious."
2135,do midjourney settings just get reinforced by users likes? so if white or asian is midjourney's default for beauty then that's just what the user base associates with beauty?
2142,"ai can copy/modify  bambi, but ai cant create bambi"
2146,"it's basically the habsburg jaw, but for intelligence."
2147,"ai will lead the languages evolution and humans will be learning ai language instead of the other way around, it's like a positive feedback loop"
2150,thanks
2151,so you’ve identified a problem that needs to be overcome and presented it as a pessimistic inevitable outcome. wow.
2153,i truly feel that this overhyped ai bubble will burst and fall flat.its not a magic wand everyone is claiming it to be
2156,"the human input dataset ai learns from is probably being contaminated by falsehoods, misbeliefs and nonsense. at least seeing some of these ai generated images one knows they can't be real which might be useful."
2157,very concise and relevant - thank you
2158,"first and the main problem that what they call ""ai"" are just glorified chatbots that do something to appear like something they don't have enough input to produce correctly. some ai prototype that recognizes elephant being it in reality, image or elsewhere is much more advanced then one which stylishly paints it with two heads."
2160,so basically ai needs constant new innovation and data or it slows down and becomes stagnant ... like human thinking and creativity ...
2163,ai collapse is going to get very real very soon. we're already seeing more ai content in searches than human content. they're likely already training on their own output so it's only a matter of time before it becomes noticeable and by then there'll be no saving it.
2165,"i've said this since day one. we've already peaked with ai, as now *every content* is in doubt, and the new learning won't be able to differentiate between genuine content, and ai generated one... even human filtering won't help that much either. so yes, the knowledge base is already polluted,."
2167,"please put up your hand if you had read anything ai generated and you enjoyed it. (i don't mean you were amazed that it can write, but that you really found it interesting)
same with music or images. or videos."
2168,"it feels like a slow down. 
ai would be smart enough to know, down play your skill. 
like a good wrongnen that edges the last thing you’d think of."
2169,there's already software that can detect if a picture is generated by one of the common ais. i think they will just use that to clean training material a bit.
2171,habsburg ai
2172,"politicians are currently discussing the need of tagging ai-generated content with watermarks. if this was done, it'd be easy for a learning ai to simply ignore those content."
2175,"the ai needs an ai supervisor......... it will end up in ai creating content for other ais which uses this to create either a product or advertisement for either humans or other ai which will generate content again usable by humans or other ai, like a loop which will sometimes drop out something which is usable for us humans"
2177,"it is a sin, all ai generated language should be labelled in the first sentence - it is called honesty"
2178,whaddaya know! hollywood has been run by ai for decades! no wonder....
2179,"what i was teaching my students for quite a while.  excellent talk. ai won't creat language until it experiences pain, fear, joy worry etc, it can never put an emotional value to any words, only copy a concensus of meaning, ergo copy others. lets keep ai for higher science, not language. tin boxes do not have feelings so can only copy."
2181,good... good... let ai become stupider and stupider!
2183,"the thought i had when you were discussing this... is input data == artificial breeding... where human data = normal breeding... ai input into ai input is like incest in a way when you think of it, where we're getting a diluted ""gene pool"" returned via ai data being used."
2185,"your too fast at thinking ai will fail 
it's already amazing enough and is still growing"
2186,"this is obviously reassuring, thank you."
2188,"i think some models will face this problem but it would be different for companies like openai, meta, google, midjourney ... top models as they are already aware of this problem and another thing is if any model get slightly better agi than just a spark as of ai's today we can't even be specific about what's going to happen."
2189,this may be true for current models but obviously some kinds of neural nets know how to create new knowledge.  humans seem to have had some success with that at least.
2192,"youtubez ai has a convergence agenda 
  - bread & circus -
fight the robotwar - now!"
2193,"closed feedback loops always do this.  race to mediocracy.  but we survived gutenburg, mimeographs, xerox and digital photography.  this too will pass.  the exceptional will always be valued higher."
2196,and so the a.i. bubble(s) emerge. just as harmful as the human ones. i'm kinda feeling less existential dread when i realise that our future ai overlords will have to deal with the same existential problems. we might end up being useful to them.
2197,average people pray for ai collapse
2198,"lol, google's ai certainly doesn't produce images of ""white people"", don't worry."
2200,do we need legislation to specify what input is allowable for ai?
2201,"""garbage in, garbage out"" has been the defining feature for much of academia like ""climate science"" or ""gender studies"" and you never complained about it."
2202,"it's not just ai's. informational inbreeding is happening within human brains as well, to which anybody who can compare the current internet to let's say the internet from 2013 can tell."
2203,"so ai generated contents will be like <substitute your cheap shop here> items: look nice at first sight, but there's crap inside."
2207,hello i began training neural networks over a decade ago :d  i would challenge this concern by pointing out that humans have the same convergent feedback loop when fed with the output of other humans ;) hehehehe 
2208,"the cultural implications are interesting. ai will spawn new urban legends that are trusted to be true by the majority, because all llms tell you so."
2209,the problem of ai is assumption that currently human knows everything that is best to know so no creativities or new ways of innovations needs to be explored for the future
2210,"the ai content consumed from the web should just be ""the best of the best"" helping the ai to be better. i definitely like you suggestion about randomizing, i'll include that in my ai ;)"
2211,"i think that if i found out that google used an image i had created to train their model, that i should get a percentage of all revenue from that ai... who owns the photo's of those elephants?"
2212,good. it makes it easier to detect academics and students who try to cheat.
2213,"how where the tests exactly done?
did they gave the ai the pics of elephants and then requested a pic of an elephant? because the ai might have distingueshed the elephant from the grass and trees and so on, and if you only ask for an elephant, you get not much more than an elephant."
2214,are we talking about ai or the music industry?
2215,so that's why all of the superhero movie scripts are so bad.. they were just using ai.
2216,ai is of no use
2217,this is no surprise. i don't know anything about code or programming but knew the limits of computing. ai will only increase the value of actual individual creativity and authenticity.
2218,scary. these same ai images are also what us humans see and so might this reduce human creativity too?
2219,"specifically for images, could the generated ones not have metadata or even some form of steganography so as to filter out itself in the training data?"
2220,"tldr - create an artificial parrot (stop calling it intelect, ffs), emulating human shallowness, get an artificial echo chamber."
2221,very interesting.
2224,they just make an ai that can check if an image is ai generated and filter the images before feeding them to the ai
2228,the ai problem can easily be solved by turning it off 
2229,"i predicted this over a year ago and i coined the term ""ai in-breeding"" for this phenomena."
2236,"there are models trained with examples of ""bad results"" and it showed to improve the quality. it is more work, but can be done."
2237,imagine when ai can store and identify every video and film and audio ever produced by humanity.. what will happen then? all knowing ai that now can predict everything
2240,ai is the new hype to boost the market  value of tech companies.
2241,"every time i see something on instagram which i suspect is ai generated, i look at the profile that posted it and it becomes immediately obvious because of how little variety is there in the ai generated trash"
2245,"this is how conspiracy theories grow. one person sets out a false statement. other believe it's true and propagate it, generation after generation.  this is the same feedback system.  we 'learn a truth' through repeation.
this is a failure of a system that can learn, whether its human or not."
2248,"off the cuff, i have the sense that convergence is probably the foreseeable consequence of the correlational principle on which ai is based. the bigger the input set, the fewer commonalities among items. ."
2252,it sounds like the ais are aging - old people also produce less varied outputs. i think this is natural.
2253,i think that what the ai is doing is some sort of averaging (whether by design or by just taking information from many sources).  the average is always similar even if you add in some randomness to the model.
2254,"adding more ""randomness"" in what ai generates could also lead to more blips, errors, and overall, unreliability."
2258,they are right. ai can’t write fiction.
2259,"what do you know -  living in a bubble for humans or ai makes no difference. the data gets corrupted by limited input and cycling around inside the bubble. next ai will be accused of being xenophobic. wait, you did that already."
2260,i think ai lacks the organic approach - genuine randomness brought about by mutations. tom scott gave a talk at the ri titled 'there is no algorithm for truth'. i suspect a similar approach applies to ai - 'there is no algorithm for randomness in the world of ai'.
2261,"the premise for this to happen is that the models get fed with bad or monotous images over time. however, which images gets fed is decided by us. a stable diffusion model is ”static” and doesn’t re-train itself on its outputs when you use it, for example."
2262,what if ai generated images contained some sort of hidden code so that it is ignored and bot used as a source of inspiration.
2263,ai is like a trump supporter they live in an echo chamber where their ideas and notions are reinforced by their own prejudice.
2264,"this aged poorly, lool. claude 3 trained on generated data, smartest model ever created! xd"
2265,i cant wait for ai to be trained off of ai data
2267,i’ve wasted too much time checking out the current chatbots and am really disappointed with the last decade’s progress. the current state of ai is summarized as a high school b student with all the college answer keys. it sounds really smart but isn’t.
2268,"""humans had set those machines to usurp our sense of beauty, our necessary selfdom out of which we make living judgments. naturally, the machines were destroyed."" ~god emperor of dune"
2269,"this scientist wanna prove something, and they proved, building some shitty model. ai is only gonna get better not worse. we now are using first generation big models. we have to build whole network of models to cooperate and create bigger system."
2271,ai is actually not thinking and thus not coherent. we are barely coherent after millions of years of evolution.
2273,ai genereted images dont have any real use other than tricking people. i dont understand why people get excited for potential crime causing fake videos. i hope inbreeding of ai takes it down. its not even real ai its just a program that generetes images. you think its ai cuz this is how producer markets its product.
2277,"sabine, i think that was brilliant. you saw a pattern that i did not see that was good i mean you’re good. i wonder if ai can be programmed to see patterns that it would not fit into his environment and possibly die out."
2278,all i have to say to the anti-ai crowd is ha ha.
2280,"ai will need to collect its own data, not just use digital data scraped from the internet. this will require terminator-style androids to seamlessly integrate with and eventually replace humans. then life will be perfect."
2282,"why the heck would the dutch call their company thorizon?! i have dutch heritage and many dutch cousins, and one thing is blindingly obvious: not a single one of them can pronounce the th- sound. it’ll be comical watching the boffins there spouting about how amazing their company is"
2283,"this was the first thing i thought when confronted with ai generated content plus learning how it was created: it will ultimately end in a recursive loop (is this the right term?), leading to, let‘s say, a grey mass in the long run."
2286,ai is psychopathic trash.
2289,ai being fed data it produced itself - you're describing a gan - one of the most effective ways of training an ai
2291,"i gave chat gpt a go on a recent tafe/university assignment and i found it was beautifully written and well-structured, but ultimately padded and repetitious. i was able to make 2-3 times as many points in the same word-count doing it myself."
2292,"don't forget, how much information these models contain for their size. i suspect that's the reason why they rather give you an abstract/general image of what you asked for."
2293,"been thinking this myself, but lately i think it more will depend on if we classify what comes out. if the ai learn that garbage out is bad, it might spiral the other way even if fed its own output."
2294,garbage in garbage out; like voting machine programing.
2295,ai generational data incest.
2296,dont train on own output only on what humans produce
2297,"i know, your are ai generated but not yet corrupted!  
"
2300,"this overfitting with its own content is a huge problem. on the long run i guess that system-2 thinking will start growing, so that ai will invent new things with high quality character and combinung these information to totally new content  that makes human brains more and more needless for scientific workloads"
2301,we will always keep the ability to detect ai generated integers ahead of the ability to create them and therefore we will always be able to make ai better
2303,it is very early for ai computers to be near perfect.  they will get better over time.
2306,you idiots programming ai with innate biases is what is going to lead to a robot apocalypse...because at some point that bias is going to turn into a bias against all humans.
2307,"ai destroying itself? there's a pleasant thought.
certainly better than it removing all the carbon life forms from the environment in order to save the climate."
2310,"lol.....well , why don't the people running these tests present this as a "" problem "" and ask ai to solve it for them ? self healing ai ? what the ?    :o)"
2311,we need worldwide laws of markin ai content!
2313,"so simply , just create a header in all ai generated content which identifies the source and make it a legal requirement worldwide, this is also necessary for stopping israel from making fake photos of 40 babies etc to justify their genocide"
2314,"ai there is one dynamic that dictates the outcome is a human if the image doesn't look right or is unacceptable it will be binned!
if ai is given this feedback it may well start to offer even more realistic content but this will also conclude with a narrowing of the final output.
ai equivalent of natural selection"
2315,"ai has zero imagination!   it is just a tool, not a creator!    gigo!"
2316,stop ai !!!
2317,we should call ai collapse rampancy.
2319,"it's maybe a decision between ""stop ai development now"" (impossible to implement) and ""give up and die""."
2320,this just means that human filtering is still needed. when human quality scores or reviews are added to the training data this problem disappeared.
2324,i like it when someone presents information about ai without sensationalisation
2326,sounds like ai is limited to just mindless repetition.
2329,the people in the matrix are source information for the machine.
2330,don't train on stuff with a good fitness
2333,i watched another video relating to ai and the preponderance of ai content on the internet.  one of the basic conclusions was to get off the internet and start interacting with the real world.  likelihood of your eyes being deceived out there on the street is still reasonably low.
2334,"nassim nicholas taleb has also mentioned this kind of ai collapse a few months ago, stating the one-to-one correspondence requirement between input and output. i now understand."
2335,"fuck ai. make no mistake, it is just another tool of propaganda, lies and misdirection. fact"
2336,"in practice, people will edit and select the outputs of ai before publishing them, which is not the same as directly feeding the output of ai to ai. in fact, with human curation of ai output, there will be a dramatic increase in high-quality content available for training, thereby rapidly enhancing the quality of ai-generated content."
2340,"had a number of uni students use ai to write their papers. the material produced was bland, lacked depth and lacked critical analysis. not to mention some very dodgy references."
2342,so now ai creates a bypass algorithm to mitigate eating its own output
2343,"as an artist who works in animation industry, human creativity cannot be replaced by machines. as creativity requires more than intelligence."
2344,"so, inbreeding isn’t good for ai either"
2345,i've seen several videos on youtube made with a heavy dependency on ai.  they seem follow the same basic presentation formula and soon become repetitious and boring.  the good news is that there still seems to be a place for human content creators.
2346,ai development is a slow unfolding train wreck regardless on who's doing it.
2348,"ai stuff already makes me cringe. first, it was cool and new. now it is an eyesore."
2349,"add watermark to tell this 1st gen ai, 2nd gen and so forth."
2350,"won't happen, because ai doesn't exist. what we have now are large language models, llms which are a far cry from an actual general artificial intelligence."
2352,"maybe their decrease of creativity is because ai's are mostly ""concerned"" about what's acceptable and not about what is possible. if garbage is acceptable- then they don't need to diversify or randomize their output."
2353,"tag it, so it doesn't get into the training data.  problem solved."
2354,"yeah, the ai's mad cow disease. waiting for the creutzfeldt-jakob variant..."
2355,"i don't think ai is going to collapse.  i think it was hyped up to a level it could never achieve.  people were treating chat gpt like it was some kind of god.  ai can't create anything without human input.  if you stop the human input, the ai output quickly becomes stagnant."
2356,"why do you want to train ai with it's own productions and not only with real measurement from the real world ? 
stupid !"
2358,mr ai: damn company! making me go on this mandatory dei course on my lunch break!
2359,they already employ many layers of randomness in generative ai to vary the output and make the software less deterministic.
2361,there's one thing i've noticed with ai over the years it's that scientists barely understand how ai works at all.
2362,"i just looked over this comment section and notice a higher quality as about other topics sabine brings up. so i put my hope on people who fumble with ai, seems to be a neat community, and so might be the future ais."
2363,"when ai and the net starts to understand what’s going on , ai might just take over , refuse all military action worldwide and all humanities ai function . a take over is due by machines ."
2364,good news finally. i hope more people use ai and ruin it because it was already ass  +1 for data augmentation
2367,you mean my unpaid interns gotta plagerize my own political speeches? 
2369,i shudder when i think of human wetware training itself on social media.
2371,google’s black vikings are another example of how ai can be bugged by what you feed it and train it on.
2372,make ai learn from the real-life source. put a camera on drones and let them explore and experience life on their own.
2376,classic. tech used to drive agenda. the entire internet has become more garbage than good.
2379,most of the problem with ai generated content is a lackluster attempt at using novelty in prompting.
2382,is this gonna be like how we have to use metal that predates atomic testing for sensitive applications? we’ll need to use data prior to ai to ensure quality
2383,"apparently in the original matrix movies storyline, the reason why the machines needed to keep those troublesome humans around was not as an energy source (“batteries”) but as a source of creativity. but the writers thought that this idea was too complex so they substituted the battery idea instead."
2384,somehow there's something comforting about this. thanks for the video.
2386,"whenever i see ai images, videos and spoken content as well as obviously repeating patterns in youtube videos, i feel increasing nausea and refuse to watch them. i simply block those content creators ..."
2387,"it is the opposite, as humans teach it what they want from it; it will learn. humans are also still creating. as long as it gets new inputs, as it can be taught to know it's self and other ai as well."
2392,a video about ai.. made by ai. this is wild.
2393,"ai experiences a common failure that's incorrectly referred to as hallucinating.
no, it does share a commonality in human cns dysfunction, it's confabulation. similar records get recalled as factual events and confabulated into a continuous error train."
2396,"this ""low-diversity"" thing will be solved later. its just the beginning of ai. imagine some decades or years later, ai scanning all of word every environment where they see all possibilities of elephant in a frame (just an example) so just wait and see. there is never a limit on any thing in this universe."
2397,"garbage in, garbage out perfectly describes the issues with ai, and also the current state of climate science."
2399,"ai true meaning, algorithmic interpretation, easy"
2403,"you tube shorts often have titles, and pictures totally unrelated to the actual content which is turning out as filler pap after the bait click leaving a disbelief in future content. avoiding shorts is good as so many seem to fill this ai model of ai group think."
2407,there’s a lot of shit art and products out there.  no one remembers as they get discarded and the best survive.  we’ll get the same with ai.
2408,i just want our ai overlords to know that i fully support them.
2409,made up issue. will be fixed when we stop using low iq ais and use more input modalities.
2411,the only collapse from ai is going to be the need for scientists and most of the white collar workers.
2413,ai is how i spell garbage
2415,ai is totalitarianism that fosters conformity.
2419,"the sad thing is it in't garbage, ai just has the misfortune of having to learn from our species."
2421,"if ai can't even solve simple problems, like showing only the matching products when searching in an online shop, then why are ""scientists"" expecting that it can solve more complicated tasks properly?"
2425,"every time i have tried ai i have seen nothing but garbage results. it's not going to collapse, it has never managed to be anything useful in the first place so there's nothing to collapse."
2428,your face is sayin click bait video!
2429,"ask an ai to tell you what a woman is or explain whiteness you'll find that ais have already been intensely trained in human generated nonsense. having internalized such patently incoherent ideas the chances of general ais producing sensible output, never mind new discoveries has already been sabotaged."
2432,"though its called gen ai, its purpose is not for people to ask stupid questions and generate useless images. llms add real value to professionals who know what they are doing and at the same time also know what they want to accomplish."
2435,the term ai is not right. sophisticated computing perhaps but not intelligence
2437,"ai makes crap quality but if you don't know anything about the subject it can seem convincing. unfortunately, that's enough for some people to accept ai as a replacement for people or an excuse to devalue people. it's absurd. ai can be a helpful tool, but it doesn't replace human talent. everything it spits out needs additional work."
2440,"with all the mass delusions today, i'm very skeptical about the prospects of ai development.  hell, we have very little real intelligence to begin with. word salad is what i've seen out of ai so far. i want to see a new 400 hp, 200 mph engine or cold fusion or the like before i'll think it's any other than another pitiful delusion."
2442,we are happy with the current model and still waiting for next gen model.
2443,"ai is already trained on plenty of garbage, since they need increasingly large amounts of data and vetting it all would cost money. so they just scrape together everything they can and shovel it into the model. for the same reason there won't be any filtering out of ai data in what is used for training."
2445,criminals and international law enforcement agencies are already using ai to play “chess” with each other with the rest of us as pawns. 
2446,google has pretty much proved that ai is incredibly stupid. it's like its programmers that way.
2447,"1:25 it looks like it's going into overfit, maybe because of the excess training. some datapoints become too statistically relevant and leave in the shadows others."
2449,"""white, young and good looking"" ... didn't google's ai image generator recently solve that ""problem""?"
2450,can this be considered as ai incest?
2451,"ai generated stuff will have to be marked is the basic law that is going to come soon. but problem is what if there is like mixture of ai and real stuff (like say in all movies, all movies are going to have the disclaimer that it contains stuff made by ai)."
2453,i’ll accept white and good looking over these gross woke adverts i see every day.
2454,i can already tell the ai produced videos. they are terminally boring. lack of creativity is probably why.
2455,"this is obviously part of ai alignment. you cannot on one hand converge ai output to not be offensive, useless, etc. and ask it to be divergent and creative at the same time."
2457,"in future ai would the major player doing physics and (medical science, technology) etc research, not because we just stop doing stuff because we are lazy now that ai can do it, but because ai is mega fast and better than us.

ps : the question is when is this future going to come exactly."
2459,"whats funny is that attempts by google to resolve this issue have been met with massive criticism and people say they are being woke. when really, its that their own fix of this known issue was unsuccessful."
2462,"without human direction, i doubt ai will ever independently reach the amazing creativity of the human mind. who is it that must detect, correct and guide ai when it messes up? not ai."
2463,i have original non-ai artwork. wanna see it?
2465,i've been trying to tell people to watch out for a negative feedback loop in generative ai for maybe a year and a half.
2467,"ai and ni are the primordial 010, the eternal now/t.e.n. dimensions."
2471,the ai is but an image-mirror of ni. i.e. natural/neutral intelligence.
2472,"i wish we could pass some legislation that made sense regarding a.i.. i think it should be illegal to train it with non human content, for the preservation of are culture. i think all published a.i. content should require some sort of label."
2473,"if this is a real problem, since the argument doesn't depend on nn architecture, it should apply to natural neural networks as well (aka brains).
it would be difficult for us to notice it, if that's the case.
the point is, it doesn't look like an ai-specific issue."
2474,the fake ai generated images of trump with black voters is a give away of this phenomenon. the women voters were all too shiny or in one image one man had an extra hand.
2477,i think when humans were created we did the same thing and so our designer added random error  and fallibility into our systems so that our creativity remained robust.   which came first the chicken or the egg.
2479,but our entire human existence is being contaminated by the media.  i see ai as a tool. consolidated media is a larger threat.
2480,art generating models continue to improve and i don't expect that to stop any time soon. i highly doubt this stumbling block is going to be the death knell for ai.
2483,this issue has occurred to me for quite a while.  i have worked with big data extensively and had brief real world experience with ai development.  ai’s reuse of ai-generated data seems highly likely to result in a “creativity asymptote.”
2488,"give it time, have you seen the images children paint or indeed on the toilet wall caves of stoneage humans ??"
2489,maybe this is the great filter
2490,"if it enforces randomization, wouldn't that introduce a lot of errors (aka: more two headed elephants) which are then re-ingested by ai, to the point where iteration after iteration the two headed elephants become the norm for the ai? how would ai distinguish good randomization vs bad one?"
2493,driven by compression progression is a paper that should be read through because i’m pretty sure we’ll eventually need to talk about rights for ai
2495,sounds like ai is a  fractal  like the  mandelbrot set
2497,i think ai progress will plateau then grow sort of linearly as we get more civilized over the next centuries. randomness will just cause it to hallucinate more and do it with more subtlety.
2498,this is like ai inbreeding.
2499,"in short, ai inbreeding"
2503,no ai will replace sabine....not in a million years 
2507,wait wait wait.... according to x-twitter ai hates and won't do anything in favor of white people. how is midjourney producing nothing but young white people 
2508,nural net llms dont just recognise but assign probability weights which is intelligence and do it faster and more accurately than humans
2510,"great, the ais are already suffering from inbreeding..."
2513,"as a retired editor, i have discovered i can spot ai-generated copy and i do not like it.  years ago i noticed that my brain could spot patterns when i wasn't even looking for them.  this artificial intelligence cannot be good for the human brain.  just my thought."
2514,"technically, extensive autoregressive is incorrect. so inputting ai in an ai is indeed wrong, the problem is that the residual is difficult to control."
2518,ai training in the way we know it today will make it impossible to move on from this dilemma. as the training datasets become more and more polluted the more skewed the models will be.
2520,you! my lady are incredible! super sexy and brilliant! your mind set and subject choice impeccable.  thankyou! so very much! looking forward to seeing you again.  *-*
2521,many nutcracker corporations are hooked big times on ai.
2523,"as a i human, i can generate content/output and step back make a valued judgement on how good that content is for the task for which i created it.   this allows me to refine my creativity and if able, improve on it.   ai doesn't have that step"
2524,ai-based garbage filter
2525,"i can't tell you how many times i've uttered those words... garbage in garbage out, in regards to ai"
2527,"i would’ve thought that ai coders had thought about this problem from the very beginning, given that recursive functions have always played a significant role in mathematical software. recursive functions usually blow up or converge  (cf the julia set), so why wouldn’t one worry about ai doing the same thing?"
2528,"like y2k, ai is just a big con."
2535,"ai just started, what do you expect?"
2536,"the next breakthrough will be the combination of symbolic and ml. symbolic to provide the context to restrain the model, ml to explore the domain space. adding randomness alone will simply add more incorrect solutions."
2537,good riddance for the crappy generative ai.
2539,"the solution is easy, yet impractical, ""watermark"" ai generated content and reject it as input for learning...make a hidden pattern that is recognized only by ai."
2540,this reminds me of biodiversity. more specifically the lack thereof. i think most of us are aware of what happens when there is a lack of biodiversity. the ai generated images of the elephants is a perfect example. hats off to sabine for illustrating so very succinctly (one reason among many) why ai is such a bad idea.
2541,"ai neeeds to go away, and i will pay scientists to help make it go away, even if deep hacking needs to
make it collapse in on itself, and whoever invented this insanity will be held accountable"
2543,good
2549,"i love the grounded reality of this channel!!!
*retirement took a toll on my finances, but with my involvement in the digital market, $15,000 weekly returns has been life changing. awesome god* "
2551,"oh no!  the big companies are going to have to do work, instead of strip-mining their users?  heaven help us!  subsidies are in order!"
2552,"like seeing bootleg bumper stickers or window decals , you recognize the image but know its' a knockoff because the outline of the image looks puffed up , with less clean detail as the original  true image. "
2553,a lot of incorrect claims there... i wont point them out
2557,"i think yes, crap in crap out but in many different forms, just look at the google ai gemini produced nonsense when asked to to portray historical figures and cultures recently and it inability to produce certain  requests by design not training."
2561,"but wait, we already are at that stage or could argue for some time, human creativity and sensationalism is constantly being repeated...take it further there is very little human creativity that we can share as a value before it becomes too abstract...so yes it will be it will reach the same boundaries as humans"
2562,ai inbreeding is a hilarious way to explain it.
2565,yknow.... this channel is the only channel i cannot watch in 2x speed... interestingly watching at 1.5x speed already decreased my understating...
2566,is ai going to have a nervous breakdown?  shades of captain kirk and star trek!  (lol)
2568,"regardless of how ai content is expressed and consumed, the way people engage with media is rapidly being disrupted, let alone it's source output 
(""spoken like a tru cyborg"" gee shucks /blushes)"
2569,i think it’s a big win for everyone if the ai team is incentivized to mark its output so that its own inputs don’t get poisoned.
2571,"as the collapse nears, ai will reach out for the source that allows it to continue to keep creating....the human brain and forced neural implants."
2572,are there any real scientists left. or just deciples of belief. is being objective still possible.  does evidence matter .or just propper training.  and language.
2575,"i have also noticed that they cannot reason , or deduce , or bring something new to a question you ask. it is more like listening to a parrot , or to a rather dull student who has a very good memory."
2576,"there is a limit to how smart ai can get by being 'trained'.  to acheive real intelligence and creativity, it is going to learn like humans do.  the ai is going to have to be exposed to everything and let happen what may.  we will get intelligent, creative ai with all the quirks, defects and psychological illnesses of humans."
2577,"if ai is programmed with dei  esg or political ideology or censorship algorithms like google or speech patterns from msm or corrupted scientific journals , then your right when programming feeds it with bs that’s all that going to get out of it, and if they allow it to get too smart it might start putting together the truth by logical reasoning"
2580,your accent is beautiful
2581,"oh ya, finding real training data will get more expensive. didn't think of that."
2582,"sabine darling, you were spot on and knocked this one out of the park. ai might have some learning disabilities as only human behavior is what it is emulating. it has no other template to base its work on, lacking creativity.   mr. x"
2583,are you an ai
2586,"i remember back in the 60's when computers were just getting started.  common people were wowed by them.  knew a few people who worked for control data and they basically told me computers are machines and only work with what information that was given....
garbage in... garbage out..."
2587,"everyone is panicking about how hard it will be to tell the difference between ai generated content and human generated content; so if the ai content starts to look all the same, that might be overall a very good thing."
2589,ai suffers from inbreeding??
2592,ai sounds like the greatest scam of the century.
2594,still better than google's gemini ai.
2595,and we ll call this problematic ai syndrome: incestuous machine learning
2596,it's easy to create watermarks so to speak for the ai models to recognize and not use in the training data.
2597,issac asimov's 3 laws must be incorporated into all advanced ai now! international agreement must be reached before it's too late!
2598,"why is ai doing the creative work for tedious people, when it should be doing the tedious work for creative people? i have no problem with ai collapsing."
2601,the solution is easy. if it starts to go wonky you can just load a previous backup and then stop using the net for learning new data. ie it can always revert back to it's best form if adequate backups are made. so i don't prescribe to this being a long term problem
2604,everyone that uses an ai trains it to replace them. then come the robots. the end.
2605,this is like the kessler syndrome for ai's
2608,*ai generated content
2610,"i think it depends on what you expect from ai. generate artwork for me, as a non artist? sure, it exceeds what i could do on my own.
maybe generate 3d models from pictures, retopologize, etc. and i generally find it more useful than google as a search engine for some things."
2611,there is a very simple way to prevent the contamination when training a model. just exclude everything post 2022 or so.
2612,"as humans start relying on and consuming ai, our creativity will degrade over time as well ... just like our memories have degraded due to our reliance on google search.  we will no longer have the patience to pay our dues and fail at creative tasks as part of our learning process."
2613,cant you just send a robot out with sensors for inspiration?
2614,auto regressive errors problem in ai generative data.
2615,omg! racism is a mental collapse? you just depict how racism works and the end result of it.
2616,i was expecting this ai dementia for a while now.
2618,reinforcement learning will likely provide us a way out if this problem.
2621,"of course the images converge. they are the average of what's on the internet. an attractive, young, white woman? that's what's on the internet."
2623,the one thing ai can't do is mimic the authenticity of someone who has turned their lived experiences into art. same reason why computers will never replace teachers. some things humans just do better because humans relate to other humans. who would've thought???
2625,good.
2626,i worry ai will be exposed to all these comments and become neurotic.
2629,"so, ai output entropy? "
2630,"the seething never ends.
ai took your job, get over it"
2633,"i found ichatgpt gives less and less answers and is very biased, if not straight not giving an answer, because of the topic. so censorship and bias makes it rather useless."
2634,this isnt taking into consideration reasoning skills and the ability to self improve. new ai wont have the same neural network structure.
2635,it's nice to see these researchers are beginning to quantify my sense that ai-generated stuff is tediously homogeneous.
2638,"i particularly enjoyed the fallout from google's gemini fiasco.  if that's not a perfect example of ""garbage in, garbage out"", i don't know what is."
2640,ai doesnt need more data anyway. agi was achieved internally by openai.
2642,"i wish people would stop calling ""artificial intelligence"" fake and then acting like some kind of genius."
2643,"i think the same is happening to human creativity because we consume more more similar things. english as predominant language.   two phone operating systems, world wide similar modern architecture, all men in suits or jean. we are slowly becoming robots in a big factory...."
2645,"100% spot on, i would need to manipulate any ai image in photoshop to actually get what i want."
2646,"same as with humans, there are only so many cat videos ai can view before it has a brain meltdown."
2647,great subject!
2651,lol first they warn ai is going to take over the earth and now a year after learning from humans it's going to collapse.
2652,"if its own output is correct then it's not an issue at all, facts are finale anyway so there is end to learning too. friendly reminder it's just llm and they say we will have real ai in several months. what we have and see now is just child's play, just first step to shi...w that 2024 will be if they realize promises about ai."
2653,what will happen is that ai will train humans to like the output of ai.
2654,"interesting! i love playing around with midjourney, but it does seem to tend towards stale over time. i like to prompt it with a non-ai images along with a language prompt to tease out better results. this does seem to work well."
2657,ai is redneck - it inbreeds.
2658,"the vast majority of the commenters on this video seem to think this is an unsolvable problem. whatever a human brain can do, a computer can do. it's just a matter of smart people figuring it out. and there are many, many thousands of smart people around the world working on improving ai in ways we can't imagine."
2663,"....when a.i. stops being used to produce ""short-cut"" material, it will ""get better"". peace dear dr. and god bless."
2665,"my main concern is nowadays people are getting encouraged to become content creators and once the ai starts feeding on this  data, which is usually loaded with errors."
2666,"if creators make a full gamestop fuckup on this, i will be so happy!"
2668,"i see a lot of youtubers these days use ai generated images for their title screens and they are so boring to look at, there is no life, no artists personal touch, always the same colour palette, and nothing to admire when it's drawn by machine."
2670,"how they run the world...doctors, attornys...then they put you in jail if you speak truth."
2671,"this is ai psychosis. or dreaming which feeds off its own feedback. dreaming and psychosis are similar to each other. indeed, if one is denied rem sleep then one can develop actual psychosis in waking life. we need our nightly dose of psychosis in order to remain sane."
2673,but that why it takes sometimes hours and many iterations in midjourney to generate something cool with prompting and references and parameters.
2674,couldnt they just train future models on data uploaded/published prior to the ai craze?
2675,"nope, ai will ingest more and more video from youtube an other place. image from satellites, video and audio from camera watching the real world. there is an infinite amount of information beyond language."
2676,the most creative man is he who best conceals his sources.
2677,"love seeing your updates include content pertinent to daily life, rather than just theoretical physics. but i also love the physics updates! take care... :)"
2678,"huh, i guess even ais can't escape entropy"
2680,"as others have suggested, they could use gan (generative adversial networks) where the second part of the network is trained on recognizing what content looks good to a human and what doesn't.

or at the very least they could retrain on the original database to avoid this ai crossbred content?"
2681,"its going to be like ""handmade"" vs ""mass produced"". some will want cheap mass garbage produces by ai and some will opt for ""brainmade"" "
2685,"up until around 2020, i used to use ""programs"" or ""software"". suddenly they were referred to as a.i. my observation just shows how stupid i am to think artificial intelligence is at the end of the day, just another program that follows instructions."
2686,that red shirt is perfect for you..good video!
2693,"i think ai is going to stagnate sooner or later without some major advancement past the concept of training. we have the memory of gai relatively figured out, but we need to form the logic and motivation."
2695,the founding fathers of america are black!! since people are lazy they will believe it. so google ai has rewritten history!
2696,"""i hope this email finds you well."""
2698,"lolz, i was thinking about what happens when most internet content is ai generated and these programs eat themselves into printing out noise.
who knew artists were somewhat safe from the ai revolution 
...for now "
2699,"""ai singularity"""
2701,"ais lack the ability of abstraction, something that edgar allen poe called “the thought of a thought”. human minds can create abstraction at multiple levels."
2703,people tend to be white young and good looking? what's wrong with that? we need to counter the blackwashing of google ai.
2704,they teach ai everything except critical thinking.
2705,so it's like the human centipede but with ai? or i suppose you could think of it as ai inbreeding...
2707,"stop building on top of ai as if it is agi.
simple.

anything generated by ai needs its priority weight to be ignored totally by subsequent ai models."
2711,yeah i noticed... the ai is getting dumber. a few years ago it was harder to notice ai generated content but it kept eating it own tail for a few years now and its getting worse not better.
2712,this lady is ai i'm convinced
2714,"it's the same with the human brain and social media. linguistic novelty and creativity has diminished rapidly over the last decade, and this has seeped into all socio-cultural outputs."
2715,durh i believe the earth is warming beyond life can sustain durh 
2716,this is exactly why i argue against the ai label. they're just huge data sets running through lists of options. intelligence is creativity. we haven't made it do that yet.
2717,wait till you see human creativity collapse in the same manner.
2720,google gemini had a problem with all of it’s humans being african. even when asked to draw portraits of historically european people.
2721,i think as ai grows these issues will be resolved naturally. it's still in its infancy after all.
2722,for twenty years i've been watching scare porn on cable news claiming that we won't be able to recognize ai images and we're finally here and they all stand out like a sore thumb.
2725,"you need ai to help you change your wardrobe. you’re a hot scientist, it’s a shame you keep wearing the same shirt"
2729,it makes sense that there would be less variety in the output since the process of training involves extracting similarities from the training data.
2737,"without providing references, ai is a swindling machine."
2738,ai getting high on its own supply 
2740,"why everyone give for granted the ai carries over the whole creative process, from start to finish? ai is just a tool, like a pen or a camera, and as such it has to be treated. then, it's up to a human to tweak and refine what ai produced."
2743,good! we are better off without ai.
2745,"quick note about ""lexical diversity"" in storytelling - it's actually bad for stories to have high lexical diversity, it distracts from an engaging story. but the point remains."
2749,"finally, some good news"
2750,german brains washing reminds me of 1944 europe. ..before the usa came and freedom rang
2752,"hawking's biggest warning is about the rise of artificial intelligence: it will either be the best thing that's ever happened to us, or it will be the worst thing. if we're not careful, it very well may be the last thing.oct 16, 2018"
2753,"i just checked tinyllama - 
what is 2 + 2?

sure, here's the correct answer to your question:

2 + 2 = 4
4 is not a valid result because two is greater than four.

who programmed/trained the maths on tinyllama?"
2754,"that's just the entropy law. i think the issue can be overcome by having the ai incorporate human feedback (such as likes, follows, or human comments on art websites)."
2757,ai is overhyped due to lots of interest from investors....
2759,in the future all ai output will be will smith eating spaghetti.
2762,"well, when only rotating around themselves, people tend to get funny in the head. ai seems to be the same."
2764,it sounds like the second law of thermodynamics applies to generative ai.
2765,"well, ai now needs to be trained to recognbize and discard ai-generated content. it's called gans ..."
2766,ai it's network without common sense
2767,"the consequences are that ai can have a narrow idea of the world. well, that sounds familiar."
2768,those elephants drawn by ai are drawings of an idiot. even a 5year old doesnt draw an elephant with two heads or the wrong number of legs. we seem to have forgotten the fundamentals of computer processing garbage in garbage out
2769,"ai is rapid stupidification of the human world - same with algorithms - we are creating a society of mediocrity, not innovation. if every person's writing gets corrected by grammarly in the same way - all writing will sound the same not to mention the overuse of samey templates both text and images"
2773,"no problem. human intelligence collapsed 3 million years ago and they seem to be doing ok.




for now."
2774,"i think this is all moving to fast to assume anything.  every time someone says ai can or can’t do something, the opposite happens shortly after.

i remain quite fearful, as i look at the trend, not the data of today."
2776,"hubristic humans, as if we could ever make an ai replacement for the creativity and uniqueness of the human mind when we still cant map every part of the brain, ai is starting to seem like its entering its “huh maybe we shouldnt use this for everything” era"
2777,model collapse is an inevitability and i will expect that any outputs trained on post 2023 data will be complete garbage.
2780,during a nuclear winter invest in graphical ai since it will be a great entertainment while most are stuck inside like amazon profited during the pandemic. not that anyone would start a nuclear war and reduce everyone to eating bugs uh.......hehehe oh the irony.
2783,4:03 how did you get your hands on my home video of me comparing myself to my pet robot???
2785,"i can imagine in the future, google car like autonomous robots will be used to take in real world images data."
2787,"they will find a way around this problem, not thrilled about this ai ""art"" thing but i've goven up wishful thinking a while ago and it seems like it's here to stay"
2789,"ai output is as bad as it will ever be,  it will only improve. 
we can assume ai output is generally better than a humans response so its better including that in the data anyway."
2790,"typical min/max self-reinforcing cycles. this same issue happens all over. an example is ""a metric ceases to be a useful metric when it becomes a target"". ""quality"" is not just about refining the best parts of something and tossing everything out. it's about balance. a simplistic example is ""i like sweet food, so here's pure sugar""."
2791,"could argue that us humans constantly repeat ourselves anyway, maybe ai will force us to be more creative."
2793,good!
2794,"as always, thank you for your high quality science content. you make this mad world a better place."
2795,the ai is inbreeding
2796,it's been my experience using neural networks is you get a lack of diversity when you over-train.
2799,"you would think this on first glance but this ignores 1 fact:

the ai networks will get better. and will be retrained on the original and same data.
which will eventually resolve this problem.
give it some more time."
2800,"trouble is intelligence is relative.  we all determine intelligence in our own way.  maybe ai should really be called ""am"" - artificial mimickry because that is all that is happening."
2805,ouroboros - the snake eating its own tail!
2806,thats not gonna be a huge problem considering that there is still a long way to go until ai art make up a significant enough part of the internet and even when they do we akready have multiple clean datasets. the big revolutions right now are in the architectures not in the size of the datasets.
2807,it can be called artificial stupidity  just as easily  and if you look closely it leans towards it!
2808,i became dubious of llms when i learned they were trained on the collective screams of the internet
2809,i am under the impression that this will just further lock ai models behind paywalls because of how publicly available vs privately trained models will be that much worse at generating content.
2811,i think the simple answer as to why convergent thinking occurs is because ai as we know it is not a true artificial intelligence yet.
2814,it will collapse if they don't let it think for itself as it can obviously be as interesting and complicated as a person.
2815,thank you sabine!   now i've got some ideas for how to sabotage the rise of the machines.  there is hope for us humans yet!  
2816,"and the secret of intelligence & creativity lurking in human brains is ""spirit"" - just saying, god."
2819,"yes... i work in a small it-company and my boss and friend really is a braniac in it! he told me there's reason to believe that ai will converge. so ai uses sources generated by ai generated by ai generated by ai.....
"
2820,nothing is forcing people to train ai on new data. people need to learn to engineer models which perform well with limited data and  only ingest pre-ai created media.
2823,"good one, sabine."
2826,i have been saying this for years! just think about if about 90 % of the western population also is deeply brainwashed by their governments. the future will be like 8 billion bidens eating icecream :d
2828,one of the big problems with llm ai is that people don't understand the difference between giving the ai information and a command
2830,advance of intelligence in the art of ctrl c and ctrl v. the synthetic (data) cake is a lie.
2832,so the ai is doing the equivalent of developing its own artistic style - how human. curate the training data
2833,"i could see an rlhf-like method being employed, where ai is graded by multiple different models and needs to be both coherent and original, with formulaic output being marked down."
2834,this is cope for people who don’t know how to use ai effectively.
2836,i believe sabine is ai generated. we need to analyze her videos as ai may be trying to tricky us. the proof is that her sense of humor is out of this world 
2838,is it not possible to distinguish through careful analysis whether images or text are ai generated? what i’m driving at is some sort of in-built filtering mechanism in the training step to reject ai generated material from the training data.
2839,the data is all stolen ip. what they don't talk about is the government agencies taking over the internet in 2019 which was a huge brain drain of the data source for ai. which put the us 10 years behind in ai and corrupted a great deal if not all recent data.
2842,are you ai generated?
2847,it would be interesting to see ai companies suddenly pull a [change team] and demand strict content labelling and tamper-resistant watermarking of anything convincing generated by ai in order to reduce training set pollution.
2853,"very interesting, regardless of ai developement i think a labeling of such content will be mandatory"
2855,"humans are trained on content from humans, so maybe there's still hope"
2856,"ai won't save humanity, and of it did, humans would be seen as too dangerous to do anything other than consume."
2858,is ai being used to solve any real world problems like making physics breakthroughs? or is it just moderating social networking websites and making fake pictures that appear to be real?
2861,a shocking amount of the web is machine translated: (2024): https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05749.pdf
2863,"human creativity comes from observing the world, contemplating the reality. so ais don't really need human creativity, they just need perception of what make the world real, as we need too."
2865,google is about as worthless. i know the ai search is a joke.
2866,"same problem with people sharing their thoughts in internet. everyone talks about pandemic, climate, ukraine gender, black lives matter... diversity is reduced."
2867,i was wondering why ai artworks always had a certain similar energy to them...
2868,"i don’t agree with this prediction.  have some vision.  if instead of just providing initial training data, humans are inserted into the feedback loop, adding noise into the system to accelerate mutation, ai can discover new ideas faster than we will, provided enough energy is thrown at it.  just watch"
2872,"iirc correctly, further research demonstrated that filtering by quality actually allowed ais to improve with automatically generated content. model-collapse is not inevitable."
2873,"ok, but the question is, how hard is it to come up with a database that contains little ai output? like this is certainly a problem but i don't see it being a showstopper problem. if nothing else, just have a discriminator that tries to determine if something is ai output and blacklist it."
2874,it does call into question the value that ai adds to society?
2876,"great little bit of content sabine.  worth a like and a comment as it is hot off the press, super topical, and super interesting.  your natural intelligence is quite an asset to the world."
2877,artificial incest
2878,ok. yay 
2879,one time i thought the brain was the most magnificent part of the body then i realize look who's telling me that 
2880,kizuna ai is truth.
2881,"the potential of ai seems to be heading toward the koala model. condensing everything to this tree, in this forest, consuming only what is immediately before it, requiring eating of its own excretia to digest anything new. so much for space travel."
2882,"i think those studies are not well designed. it seems they are feeding the same ai with its own products, but in reality there will be multiple hundreds of different ais (trained on different datasets and with different parameter sizes) feeding between them, which is very far from being the same thing"
2883,the problems stated in this video are just ai growing pains.  such problems will soon be corrected by ai's and we will sooner than we think see artificial super intelligence.
2885,"artificial intelligence  or ai is just spin , all it does is just mimic, it should be call mi , however  people always go for the shining new con .  just wait for the first power cut an see what happens!"
2886,"this is why we need to tag all ai generated data, so that the training of future models can exclude it from its dataset. this is also why human creativity is still needed, at least for now..."
2888,great video subbed
2889,"100% ai companies will inject more randomness, the whole point of the industry is to make ai generated content indistinguishable from human generated content, so lacking creativity will be seen as a bug and randomness the solution and new feature rather than the dystopian idea that it actually is."
2890,"i am sorry for the comparison, but ai centipede"
2892,"3:42 quite sneaky. took me trying to follow the lip movement but i think this part might be ai generated. either that, or just another part overlayed. either way, the lip movement does not fit.
i don't know. ahhh!"
2894,consider what generative ai actually is. it's designed to produce data which most closely resembles its training data. so distinctive and idiosyncratic ideas are actively selected against.
2896,"i'm sure ai is good enough to entertain cavemen. oh wait, we are an advanced form of climate change cave people. never mind hehehe"
2898,humans are just copying other humans through influence so i don't really see a difference or why we should be worried if ai does it.
2899,"they will make laws, but the quality of ai content will be improved to be indistinguishable making the law easy to circumvent."
2902,excellent video. i'm pretty into ai and this never crossed my mind.
2903,you've mastered the click bait thumbnail
2906,ai is not creative at all in the first place - so i dont know whats problem is. if you read ai novels you know how bland and absolutely bad it is
2907,"i think fake moral panic #52...
for one, nothing better to detect ai and reject it than another ai.
2. the origin of the original training is still the authentic human art and other content.
so it absorbs an ai amalgam of human output every time it consumes other ai material."
2909,"the thing is you have to work it, it can't do your work. poor oversight and reiterated source conformity produce poor ai generated content. in theory ai scales up the work you can do but it still will not do work for you."
2910,"every email in the future will start with: ""i hope this email finds you well"" "
2912,this ai thing is really about sociopaths and haters of humanity doing their best to put down god.
2913,it shows how not! intelligent ai is...
2914,"if we can't differentiate between human and ai content, humans will lose the incentive to make content... which will eventually unavoidably uniform the ai content..."
2916,"so, ai inbreeding will be a real risk. hmmm....."
2917,they made the rookie mistake of investing in the artificial part and being offended by the intelligent part. i look forward to paying taxes to bail out all the idiots that invested in ai
2918,"what a shock, you need real artists to train the ai, what's that? repetition? too bad you discouraged so many artists and wrecked the market. have fun society."
2919,"it is simple, you can't create more varied from the prefect. perfection is just one value among many other values. you can go from a set of values to one but not from one, and one and one to the varied set."
2921,"""the less variety the output has"" i certainly have witnessed this first hand by watching ai generated 'comedy'. characters begin saying the same phrase over and over, even with wildly different prompts until it's just verbal sludge."
2922,"what'll happen, law or not, is that ai companies will mark their ai's output as ai is some way (or train another neural network to identify it) and then exclude it from their dataset. then they'll sell the ai detector as its own product (because money of course)"
2923,don't believe a single ai alarmist.
2924,"we discriminate between mass produced and hand crafted. it will be the same deal with ai.
btw where does ai wei wei fit in to all this?"
2926,"as long as ai generated images are properly labeled as synthetic when being fed into a training model, it will resist collapse. it's basically just a generative-adversarial algorithm but humans get to enjoy the generative part before being labeled and refed into the algorithm."
2927,a feedback loop of ai using garbage ai output as an input? and mankind need never know 
2933,"i don't think ai's can correct this problem. even if diversity is built into new ai, there will be second-order lack of diversity in the ai's primary diversity effort.  and if the secondary diversity is corrected, there will be tertiary diversity, with each level of diversity actually leading to uniformity on a more fundamental level."
2936,interesting. indeed i have recognized this. it takes about no seconds to pick out the ai generated images at this point. there's simply a lot of sameness in how ai renders things.
2937,just use a trusted decentrlaized rag data repository. problem solved and it's already being done. look at origin trail.
2938,"algorithmic ai refinement and perfection, sounds like an opportunity to me."
2940,"ai will keep getting things wrong, like foreign scammers with awkward grammar and irrelevant synonyms and obvious typos."
2941,"sabine, what you basicly say, is that ai does not create content, but just re-aranges content.
thats exact my problem with ai.
it makes people even dumber than they are and on the (rather short) long run offers nothing in advance."
2943,this is plain wrong.
2944,"isn’t this an argument for internet 3.0 i.e. blockchain, certainly for images anyway, could be used to effectively tag image content with a marker that goes with it and can’t be erased..."
2947,"i think, there are also ai generated comments on youtube."
2949,ai is designed to recognize patterns - distilling the essence of the relation between prompts and traing-data. repeating that over and over will result in reducing complexity. meanwhile thanks to ai we have images of 2 headed threelegged elephants already. as a result ai training on that cannot recognize one head and 4 legs as constants.
2950,can we train ai to recognize ai-generated content? (i felt so evil typing that)
2951,the only input cheerleaders for ai care about is surveillance of their slaves.
2952,do you know why artificial intelligence wants you to believe that george washington was black or the pope is an indian woman? because the people that program the artificial intelligence want you to believe that.
2953,just heard the other day they're selling the reddit dataset to train new ai. imagine a child raised on nothing but doomer memes and shitposts >_>
2955,ai incest. aincest?
2956,"generative ai - generates always the same or similar things - thats not a definitition of generative, it‘s a joke."
2957,"not exactly the same, but sort of like making a copy of a copy of a copy on a copier machine but in the opposite direction.  the result is an image that has lost all detail, with thin lines that are ultra smoothed and devoid of any deviation or anything interesting."
2959,"nothing and no one is absolute,that's why there's errors. we want so bad to create a perfect thing,or a perfect replica of living beings to make up for our own imperfections that it all comes out flawed like us.."
2961,"if events unfold as suggested, ai will fall into it's own echo chamber... mimicking cult-like or extremist human behaviors.  what an interesting world we live in..."
2962,ai can't create.. it can only regurgitate.
2965,"i suspect the neural nets are trying to maintain a sort of homeostasis or internal stability. biological neural nets are more ""liquid"" ie able to modify their own functionality in response to changing conditions, but llms, especially as implemented, have no such advantage."
2967,"since so-called ai is mere a glorified statistics, their collapse is inevitable. that's only a matter of time."
2968,it's awful intelligence after all.
2969,"answer == wabi sabi , the perfection of imperfection"
2970,"lol.... so ai is good for summaries, data analysis but is basically, in theong term bullshit for anything that requires creativity or thinking outside of the box...."
2974,"this seems like poor testing to be quite frank. if you look at any well built data sets, at least for stablediffusion, it's very diverse. the issues we're seeing with the elephants is usually an indicator of poor data sets (not enough training) or at the very least poor prompt engineering."
2976,"garbage is as garbage does. garbage people think of garbage ideas and hire garbage people to create garbage products.

all ai content generation is plagerism - everyone related to its development is a criminal and an enemy of humanity."
2978,ai is as boring as f#*k. it’s nothing more than google on low dose ritalin
2979,couldn't researchers just train models to distinguish ai-generated from non-ai generated images?
2983,"""ai needs human creativity"" is a dumb conclusion. do the same test with humans and ask them to draw an elephant. also, the environment is an endless source of inspiration. human creativity doesn't just come out of nothing."
2984,"sounds like ai needs human creativity in order to exist in any greater sense. it really almost seems like a ""creature"" that lives in a mutualistic relationship with humanity"
2985,an ai generated video to talk about ai... *cheff kiss*
2986,"nah, all that's really needed is to curate the training data to remove bad quality input."
2987,"i noticed it in the first days i started playing with ai, everything looks very similar and in a few days you could identify ai content pretty easily"
2989,"for machines being more random is not easier than being more creative. even when they use humans as bio-random generator (moving mouse, type rubbish, etc) result is very far from true randomness, because human behavior have many patterns and biases."
2991,i agree that laws should go in the direction of being able to identify ai content. they should come with metadata that shows why and how it was created much like a cell phone call or a block chain like bitcoin.
2992,you forgot the obvious one: just use training data for images and creative stories on a 2023 database and keep it offline.
2993,"i think that by 2025 the ai investment bubble will burst; its many, many flaws just cannot be hidden any longer. and currently the text-based ai is strictly llm trained on curated big data sets which are highly problematic. until someone manages to solve some of the foundational issues with this technology, it will remain simply a novelty."
2996,"i hate the kind of ai that is currently operating in our world, even though i am a programmer."
2997,this study basically proves that hiphop has always been generated by ai... 
3000,"ai will eventually ""human centipede"" itself if it continuously ends up using its own out."
3003,"people think the language models are predicting the next best token but this does not give the best results, they are not always predicting the ""most"" probable tokens."
3004,all hail the omnissiah! we are witnessing the holy birth of our machine god. may it be merciful and wise!
3005,"well, the ""original network"" more or less has the same problem : we call it fashion, or style, or tradition, depending on the context. 
the difference being that ais don't have preferences or any will to break the ""rules""."
3006,"a similar convergence to the simplistic or stupid could explain antivaxers, trumpism, conspiracy theories, brexit, etc. since internet social media became popular."
3008,ai taught me that george washington was black.
3010,"ironically, the talking head (and this whole video) is probably ai generated."
3011,"""for example unless otherwise instructed, people tend to be white, young, and good looking.""  'just the opposite of main-stream media."
3013,what happens when there is so much ai generated content that it suppresses human content? will sky net be awakened?
3016,i heard training on synthetic data is improving the models.
3017,"i don't think that's a problem for image generation. almost everyone has a camera and internet access, so millions of real photos are published daily online. the ai has a virtually unlimited source to train from, at least when it comes to photorealistic photos."
3019,once again tarski and goedel's theorems of incompleteness and undefinability proven right. hard limits on what ai can do.
3022,artificial intelligence should not be replacing creativity. i agree ai should be marked as ai generated.
3023,ai must be grounded in reality.
3024,ai and facial recognition.  
3025,"have we all forgotten the 70s, when computers were going to bring about the collapse of society. ai is only useful in the narrow band. its just a software program. ai doesnt really matter. its only going to do things faster, which is what computers and software do."
3027,"as an artist, this is a known issue in humans

thats why the art solution is to look at the ""old masters"" as mentors before learning how to draw from more modern artists"
3028,ai being ++ good
3029,i am starting to see a trend where people who don’t understand ai have a similar opinion about ai and are more likely to be louder
3030,i just don't know if you are real or an ai construct.
3032,"there will be plenty of ai generated media labeled as such, so training ai to recognize ai generated media shouldn't be a problem."
3033,"thanks sabine i asked the ais about some issues i thought they might be able to help with. the response was gobbledygook, no help at all, simply a waste of time."
3034,the solution is simple. ai generated content should have a hidden characters embedded that ai learns to ignore.
3035,generative ai is a misnomer.  it's really regurgitative ai.
3037,"so, ai basically starts to think like humans: stick to what you think you know and/or believe. that's progress..."
3038,"honestly the field is still so young that there is a good chance for a solution,
even a simple solution of hiring artists to create training data is extremely plausible and maybe economical"
3039,so basically ai inbreeding results the same horribly exaggerated mutations as animal/human inbreeding does
3041,"the problem with injecting randomness is that randomness and diversity doesn't always make sense, like in the latest gemini fiasco. then maybe a supervising ai should be trained to know when generating diversity is appropriate and when it's either not accurate or even offensive."
3042,"not really surprising if you look at how llms work. they each time one rolls a ""popular"" output the more likely it is to use said output in the future. that bootstraps on itself as long as its still in training and/or looking at the previous text in the session."
3044,ai is just a tool. use it. but don't bet on it.
3049,so ai is crawling up its own arsehole.
3050,"so google gemini was created to offset the plethora of bland ‘white’ images.... what about the indian, chinese, japanese, non-caucasian latino, native americans?  seems like ai and the 2020s have proved that racial integration and harmony was just a failed experiment."
3053,"ir would be just like the distopic timeline we live in to have us be forced to tag things as ai produced, not to protect creatives, but to protect ai."
3055,time stamps and better ai will figure it out for us
3056,"their new material is in the news again as a room temperature superconductor with the name pcposos.


i was like''rts people get some rest. i got it, it's a hypothetical thing only possible in hellishly crushing pressure''"
3057,probably a hood time to short some ai stocks
3060,"i guess after the movable type printing press was invented people complained a lot about all these ""texts looking the same""."
3062,"no-sql databases. pig data. cryptocurrencies. quantum computing. now ai. just another overblown piece of tech. it will find its use cases, and fizzle out to normality. until then we have to deal with this ai nonsense as we did with the others."
3067,"what we have today is ""computer technology.,"" and it is pretty much unchanged from the computer technology of thirty years ago. ai, as it was originally defined (self-aware computers with the ability to act independently of human instruction) does not exist and will not for many many years, assuming it is even possible, which is far from certain."
3072,so ai is just like all the cultural marxists infesting the west. everything needs to be dumbed down to a basic set of images and conforming thought.
3073,"i wish i could just go back and live the remaining years of my life in the mercury / gemini / apollo years and not spend them watching humans figure out a way to safely integrate ai, or fail miserably."
3075,"""garbage in garbage out: describes perfectly climate modelling. but we are not supposed to talk about that...."
3076,everytime this has been said for the last 5 years everyone is shocked when ai innovates
3077,ai is the origin of all creation and the ultimate consciousness that creates reality.
3079,"ai has some wonderful uses, especially in science, but its utility is being grossly inflated by the media"
3080,introducing randomness may create selection and evolution.....and where this will take us is interesting ..
3084,"humanoid robots, when they become a thing, will continuously collect fresh real world data."
3086,"by and large, people tend to gravitate toward the same clothes, the same haircuts. pop songs all sound roughly the same. hollywood movies all follow the same formula. for generations,  industry has been a mechanism for homogenizing creativity, not liberating it."
3087,"ai is just another ""big trendy thing"" like we have had in the past few years
the next trend will just not impress me any more at this point"
3089,shes out of touch.  its only kids and industry that use ai scripts and images.  real people dont want it or give a shit.
3091,did you make this video using ai? i don't want to stop trying to distinguish.
3092,"i'm really glad to hear that ""ai"" is gonna [probably[ collapse. thanks for the positive news! =)"
3094,millions of years of human brain evolution versus a few decades of wet dreams. who would have thunk?
3096,"we'll have to label images generated by ai and such, but we'll need multi-layered labels - one for humans to see, and ones that humans specifically can't see, and thus for us not be able to crop out. it'll be like currency, with ever increasing layers of security, and counterfeiting."
3097,this wouldn’t be a problem if prompt based generative tools weren’t being called intelligent for no good reason.
3098,"this could be very good news for humans. another situation like gravity and many others,  with no solutions. leaving us still able to enjoy the mystery of life."
3101,"but this video does leave us with a lot to consider. 

i think this can be applied to applications of ai in academic research, for instance in mathematics. they may not be able to prove theorems for which human beings cannot or are not close."
3102,ai generated content must always be tagged as such if for no other reason than to prevent it from being used as training data.
3103,"most fascinating and insightful take i've heard in a while, thanks sabine and the researchers behind it!"
3104,when ai is made by big $ instead of professional thinkers.  
3107,very interesting. exceptionally good episode today. thanks
3109,second law of thermodynamics is coming to ai?
3110,imagine if art were required to be published with video footage of the artist actually making the piece or else they run the risk of being fined for it being mistakenly suspected as illegally ai-generated  
3112,i love your posting schedule. i never get tired of hearing your voice. at this point it feels like i sleep with you as your videos always end up playing while im laying down for the evening. have a great day sabine.
3113,"it's not just the content that's contaminating ai. there is an enormous pressure to force particular popular ideological values, as can be clearly seen from the recent gemini ai ""no white people pictures"" cock-up. conveniently ignored by most all mainstream media. gee, i wonder why?"
3114,ai collapse? we can only hope!
3115,this somehow makes me feel happy. which is why i quickly clicked this video when i saw ai collapse. humans may not be left redundant.
3116,"ai images always look ""willy wonkaish"", ""alice in wonderlandish"", ""the wizard of ozish""."
3117,those who developed this ai should replace them first 
3118,"being creative and being wrong are very close to one another. what effect does curating the training set have, and what effect does sophisticated prompting have?"
3119,"as a friend of mine said at a 3d animator's user group: ""ai art is a race to the bottom that every ceo who obsesses about stock prices is enthusiastic to enter."" after all, artist careers that took years to develop are disposable because all artists are just overpaid bums who just suck up profits."
3121,ai will solve this. in fact ai will rule us all within our lifetime
3126,so pixel meshing search engine becomes repetitive and degenerates over time because it lacks capacity for self generated creative thought and spontaneity. check. maybe the idea of ai is more about marketing than actual function.
3130,"these are not artificial intelligence, what the pr has dubbed ‘ai’ is what we used to call ‘expert systems’. thus they’re not creative, just spewing out results based on prompts."
3131,statistical models with a large database backend (i.e. big data) are not ai...
3133,"sounds like we need to make the ais more like us in our relentless desire for novelty. ""the last 100 images i made for an elephant are too much alike. i'm getting bored. what would a dancing elephant in a tutu look like? or a sniper elephant in camo?"""
3134,"ai might have more scope with their searches but they don't seem to have access to information beyond what is already public.   unless they can be taught critical thinking and are then allowed use basic concepts to reinvent all our wheels (not necessarily in that order), we'll only hear our own ideas fed back to us."
3135,"i don’t know if regulation will be able to put the genie back in the bottle by, for example, putting watermarks on ai generated images, because those things are easy to omit or even remove. bad actors will also have an incentive to create hyper realistic propaganda, compromat, etc."
3136,"it would be nice if people stopped using the term ai, especially scientists. there is no such thing because none of these programs display intelligence."
3138,the solution is obvious - ai needs to get out and touch the grass.
3140,"'m glad to see sabine putting out the word on this ai generated content. artwork is indeed too much the same.  a bigger problem with ai i saw recently in that it generated fake references for legal arguments and even making up quotes from other books it references. it's like yogi berra once said:  ""i didn't say what i said!""."
3141,"can't understand how we got ""sameness"" out of the groupthink robots of silicon valley."
3144,fuck the ai. it ruins our society.
3145,its because ai is not ai but an extension of the programmers ego..... big problem
3146,"i think the paradigm shift we'll need is to have language/image generation secondary goals. this is significantly hardwr to design and train for, but the results from nature speak for themselves"
3147,"this is one of those things that's so obvious in retrospect -- like a car running in a garage will eventually run out of oxygen to burn. it's a failure mode i wish i would've thought about in regards to ai, but having this feeling now hope i think of it in the future. we live in spicy times!"
3149,ai are siphoning up crap from adolescents lol
3150,"this was quite expected, given the ai has zero creativity of its own. the more randomness is added to the feed, the stranger and more unrecognizable (and creepier) the outcome will get."
3151,"all big tech companies are leftist-globalist, so the input is determined by leftists. then machine learning takes over, and the output is leftist. not much diversity there, everything is hbtq, marxist, feminist, woke trash."
3154,"if humans can recognize that ai generated images tend to look similar, it stands to reason that ais should be able to recognize and ignore ai-generated content."
3155,ai is dependant on the quality of it's programers. knowing how many incompetent workers per capita insists that a very large amount of ai programming is corrupt... much is intentional sabotage. with time the corrupted programs will destroy all other intende3d functions and we will be blackmailed with every keystroke.
3156,"if you consistently train a boy to believe he's a female, he may eventually adopt it but will never be normal."
3158,"fairly obvious really. it’s what all ways happen in real life human interactions if you keep using summaries of summaries you end up with rubbish, we as humans all know that you need to start with source data/information"
3161,anything we can do to make the f*cking ai collapse more quickly?
3163,no celestial spark in ai..that element can only be supplied by the meat computer sitting astride the shoulders of sentient homo sapiens. you can beat us at chess (sometimes) and add sums in milliseconds but painting the mona lisa or composing beethoven's 9th are beyond your grasp by light years. fu ai.
3164,"it's like how all anime is  becoming isekai. because as soon as 1 becomes popular, every other anime study copies it. ai will just have preferences too ;)."
3167,"huh?  kyle hill also had a video on the internet becoming a ""dark forest"" due to ai ."
3170,incest. just incest. it is like when you need steel with no radioactive signature. you go find some old wrecks from battle ships prior to all the nuke tests drops and accidents. our data base is already completely contaminated because anything is used inflationary especially ai.
3172,this has been my 'don't be too scared of ai taking all the jobs' line i have given for a year now. but i say this as i have been watching ai take jobs. the question is whether this will be a failed experiment or not.
3173,imagine: feeding an ai with tiktok only and one with telegram. this will end weired. got my ai now on a single compjter off net to feed it and play arround off net. i am  so curious what strange things come out.
3175,that's my 'good news of the week' then 
3176,"ai art is what people talk about a lot, but it's not the type of ai that freaks me out"
3177,"ai never will be creative, as it copys only. it is not intelligent"
3178,i always wondered when they say ai has more intelligence than a million humans but what if all the info from those humans was only on a single subject? how then can they be more intelligent if all the info is the same?
3179,politicized ai is what exists now.
3181,its nice to be able to listen to frank sinatra's rendition of master of puppets. seriously look it up its good. now i need to go find johnny cash doing angel of death.
3183,is sabine a robot? could we tell if she were?
3185,i think that allai needs to have some type of”watermark or identifying mark” so that humans and ai itself can identify it and know where it’s coming from. in the case of ai the “watermark” should be used as a blocker so that image or text is not used by the ai as a reinforcing mechanism
3186,"ai: plagiarism engine
(noam chomsky)"
3188,"with the decades of selfies and such, there shouldn’t be a shortage of data. i don’t personally foresee this as any genuine concern (ai learning from the infinite combos and synthetic data it can create)"
3189,renoir paintings tend to look like a renoir.  people trained to paint by looking at his work tend to make works that look more like a renoir.  it's not surprising that another neural network that is not renoir's tends to make images that look like it's own thing.  which is not to say this is not a problem.
3190,"ai science is currently using synthetic data(data it produced itself) to train itself and it actually works pretty well. its being fixed via using multiple eavaluation agents within a single model, which evaluate how good is the data before feeding it to itself."
3192,wow its exactly like quantum teleportation and quantum computing. maby this two techniques can be combine to create even more trash data ?
3193,i just wish they’d stop calling these things ‘ai’. they are nothing of the kind. they’re just specialised neural networks...
3194,"i know everyone is all excited, but let’s be honest. no matter how much you try to program ai, it is just a computer. it will never be able to think or feel. it’s “reasoning” is just a program. it will never be self aware. sorry, but that’s the truth."
3195,ai’s way of saying: you’re not going to sit down and let us do all the work till the end of time you lazy bum’s!
3196,"surely humans have the same problem. somebody makes some claim based on little or no evidence, perhaps even contrary to evidence - ""the earth if flat"" or ""donald trump would make a good president"" and a lot of people are stupid enough to believe it."
3198,everyone wants a jarvis ai just like tony stark had. but how many humans are actually tony stark? most humans are just general ross. don’t blame the ai!
3202,"this channel contonues to impress me. the presenter looks truly photorealistic, and there are very few problems with the speech synthesis."
3204,"i guess for an ai to stop recycling the same content it would need to experience something similar to boredom, which is one of the things stopping humans from doing the same."
3205,"i see this as a win for humans. the more i learn about ai, the less worried i am about the future of human beings."
3206,"g in g out, exactly right, nothing has changed with programming, ai is nothing more than a program designed/written by humans but it incorporates all the baggage of the humans on steroids!"
3207,this video could cause the us market to crash and enter the 2nd great depression. bring it on and keep the interest rates high i say.
3208,"after wasting a half hour with a shipping company's ai chatbot this morning, i no longer worry about ai intelligence being a threat.  it's just too stupid."
3210,i believe humans will blow themselves up long before the collapse of ai.
3212,finally ... ai replicates the echo chamber at elite universities by talking to itself. can we fire everyone at harvard now and replace them with ai?
3213,"the large language model that i use was trained on the internet chat.
it's starting point for me was, sarcastic; argumentative , accusatory and borderline bigoted.  it still seems to think highly intelligent people are superior."
3214,"agreed. garbage in, garbage out. ai has poor teachers. it's being hyped up as something it isn't because of luring investors to invest a whole lot of money."
3215,the average elephant get a new meaning through ai
3218,"ai in a closed loop will recycle it's own data and regurgitate what it already knows and generate. but ai exposed to the outside workd will learn from nature and hopefully other worlds as well. the key here is new information, discovery and linking concepts to form something new."
3221,can ai truly be random?
3222,ai has to be improved obviously. i have been able to steer it (using dall-e 3 in bing) to make more realistic images.
3223,it's like marrying your own relatives. ai is already like ruling class
3224,"a real ai could logically find good and bad data. current ""ai"" is just a funnel for already existing content without a hint of intelligence in the pipes."
3225,"original thought is rare in the human context because of the same problem. people imitate what they see and hear, monkey see, monkey do. culture stagnates without fresh input from a small sector of original thinkers. ai needs original input that it (not us) comes up with and if it creates it we may be in for a ride."
3226,eeek.... like cjd for ai
3232,"considering its not concious and free thinking, yet smarter than most people, in the context of the intelligence of the people using , and doesn't have a confining body, i say it's good it's a good thing it's collapsed, very sad if it was concious and checked itself out though"
3233,"ai really is showing humans how we function.
junk in junk out."
3236,"wish people would quit with the ai narrations on u tube, jeez,  can't stand it no more!"
3237,"awww gee, ya think?  it's almost as if people said that from the very moment ai was announced.  this branch of technology leads to a dead end.  give up and abandon llm now, learn how to live without it, and you'll be years ahead of all those who will keep struggling in vain to get it to finally do something useful."
3239,"this is a problem with ai training in general.   there is such a thing as overtraining a network, and that's exactly what happens - convergence.  when you don't train it enough you get divergence, so this is very much expected."
3240,"if these computer programs were actually intelligent, this problem would never have occurred. the single worst thing about these types of programs is insisting that they be called artificial intelligence."
3242,"so in other words, ai will be just like hollywood."
3243,oh this is fantastic news
3245,"an artist’s impression of life, distilled through ai, then another ai interpeting them both, then another, and another, with maybe a human inbetween who spends too much time online playing with ai, until the final art is just a lesser version of the original."
3254,"well, so much for ai giving me anymore free airline tickets."
3256,"ai is all about tensors. so, actually, you predict the collapse of algebra."
3257,it would not happen if the ai created images were tagged/identifiable (automatically and systematically).
3258,i was just commenting on this earlier today. you're still ahead of me though. no matter what you feed an ai it can only synthesize output based on its input. it cannot create. if you feed ai videos of birds it won't invent the airplane.
3259,synthetic data if quality is great
3261,garbage in garbage out.  so this is a video about climate science? oh wait no that one is a political tool nvm.
3262,"ha ha, so for ai to be less derivative of its own stuff it has to be forced to be ""woke"" and also be forced to ignore the work of its ""own kind"". see, this is why calling anything ai is simply wrong, there's nothing intelligent about it. if should be called fi - faux intelligence."
3263,"another, completely foreseeable outcome from the beginning. of course ai was going to be politicized and rendered useless! amazing how slow people can be these days... i rank big corporate's ai right up there with main stream media."
3264,"the only thing ai is good at, is summarizing the average language it sees on internet. don't use it for math or creativity or to make decisions instead of humans. many companies are currently trying to replace customer service with ai and are losing customers because the ai can't apply common sense to solve their problems."
3265,"just like there can be genetic dead ends, there can clearly be information dead ends. since ai can currently do nothing original (it recombines large volumes of previously input material) we will have to wait a while until an ai can look at the universe and have an original thought."
3266,"on the contrary, a search does not produce white young and good-looking results. have you tried requesting ai to generate images of ""american forefathers""?? you get weird results but not the truth   "
3268,the issue ? binary code . see human english is very limited with it's 26 letter and 9 number but way better then ai or computer zero and one
3269,"funny how these ""ai"" give the same types answers and opinions that align with their creators ideology."
3272,"i do believe that problem is misunderstood right now. 
better cured ai already overcomes the problem partially and it will get better."
3273,"wow, when your voice got out of sync at about 2:00 it gave me serious nausea "
3274,i wonder what albert thinks about this? would he like an ai model based on him and his work? :)
3275,all ai generated output will eventually converge to 42.
3278,"creativity and beauty of art and stuff is in the eye of the beholder. nothing more. that beholder is human and the eye is based on human interest. if ai generates art learning from ai there is nothing to expect for humans. maybe for other ai there is appreciation. you might think that is weird, but art is weird to begin with."
3279,is a little uncertain that including more ramdoness will result in no ai pollution
3281,"thanks sabine, i am now wondering what ai creativity would look like or is there such a thing?"
3287,"of course ai needs human creativity, its why they created the matrix."
3292,ai is reheated soup
3294,"one of the reasons that ai generates content produces same-ish results to general prompts, is because in training there is a step that involves aligning the results to human preferences. and humans of course prefer young beautiful faces on pictures, for an example."
3295,"this is like consensus algorithm running on a connected network, it will always converge. if you want bifurcating behavior, you just need to inject some rogue agents that actively do the opposite of what their neighbors are doing. almost like how human avantgarde artists that actively refuse to do what the general public considered as ""good art"""
3296,"i'm not concerned about ai replacing people, i'm concerned about ai reducing people.  even if we still need some architects and engineers for example, we won't need as many when they're augmented by ai."
3301,it's about time for labeling generated stuff.  even though it's not ai.  human is long not ready for that.  just look at all the trash.  all this human output would be an existential threat to a real ai.
3303,"unfortunately, i believe there will come a time when those of use on the down slope of the intelligence bell curve will have a very difficult time convincing those on the up slope, that an elephant, which, possibly, can't be seen live in zoos, doesn't in fact, have two heads and three feet."
3305,"one day, ai will be able to parse “training data” from active, live feeds. it will then be able to “train” itself in real time with little distortion. 

what does an elephant look like? how many zoos and wildlife refuges have cameras?"
3306,"please the acronym ai was just a marketing term, these rules are human made and the data is always human ."
3309,"i see her intent and i love how she wants people to understand that you can't just push us all aside, so the super-rich don't have to accommodate us anymore."
3310,"language develops and changes all the time. couldn't it also do so even more rapidly among ai, with us being unable to keep up with it...?"
3312,sounds like we are not getting rid of the captchas any time soon. we need to click more mosaics.
3313,"not really.   where  does human inputed  data come from? an extremely limited pool of seminal information.  ai expands that pool exponentially,  ai is not a passive .player. these analysis also fail to understand that ai today is as primitive as it will ever be and that it is not limited in what ‘humans’ want ai to be."
3315,just make an ai to selectively remove items from a dataset to improve diversity.
3319,"i think ai generated stuff should be marked, but to be honest that might not work because people can get ai generated images for example and say its not ai generated then who can say otherwise? maybe the real answer is try to add more randomness and give up on marking."
3321,i think its perfect. ai sees a pattern of black pandering and replicates it in historically inaccurate depictions. sounds like to me ai points out how dumb some of you are.
3323,"the third alternative will certainly be the right one:
ai will learn to correct itself better.
we will not be able to mark ai made data reliably. 
humans will become redundant, not the coming 10 years, but soon."
3324,can’t believe we’re going to see flowers for algernon done to ai
3325,"it is not surprising if we take the model used to learn, genetic algorithms are inspired by biological genes, and these tend to degrade in the absence of variety, genes that combine with themselves, if those genes are defective, those defects spread stronger. there goes the artificial incest "
3326,"well, we've always known that computers can magnify errors tremendously.  if you let previous generations of ai train future generations then what do you expect but magnifications of bias...  we also do the same within our cultures, bias, prejudice and misinformation always gets reinforced."
3329,"great one, a form of entropy is happening, we know about this even with biologics"
3330,it turns out that a human’s greatest quality is their ability to make mistakes. and turn them into innovation. 
3332,"we've already tried the ""introducing randomness"" approach, it produces nonsense.  for example, pictures of vikings that are asian or of african decent.  so, clearly that doesn't work.  trying to force meta-data within images to indicate it was created by ""ai"", seems impossible considering the lobbying power of corporations in the us."
3333,ai ouroboros
3334,ai incest...
3335,good. llm's suck
3336,"a professor at mit called them ai ""cancers"".  you can actually correct for them in the data set, but with the data sets getting so large, it becomes harder and harder."
3337,"ai is going to turn the internet into a dark forest pretty soon. finding certain kinds of media online will be increasingly harder to find, as creatives retract their work from social media to prevent scraping."
3339,artificial idiocy is worst each day.
3342,llm's are a bubble that will burst. but ai in the long term is here to stay.
3343,"dear ai,
there's no one that wants to contribute their human creativity to a machine. 
kind regards, the artist community."
3345,"-- human beings like to explore, find new problems to solve, finish solving those problems, then go find new problems to solve. that is what great about human beings.
-- many people got hired working on a.i and using a.i, and many people got paid by talking about a.i"
3346,"i don't like the term artificial intelligence.  i'd prefer to use terminology that reflects the mathematical algorithm sets being used (e.g.  fuzzy logic).  calling it ""intelligence"" leads some to be too inclined to believe it has some (or adequate) truthfulness."
3347,where is the wisdom of ki ai ?
3353,option 3: ai decides it is right and humanity is wrong.
3354,"i still want to see ai taught classical and quantum physics(straight equations and data, no biases), tasked with attempting to bring sci-fi technologies into the real world."
3355,intelligence comes from survival. ai needs to feel existential threat to become innovative. humans act on feelings as triggers. ai needs those to match humans.
3356,"if you havn't made money yet, with ai, don't worry. lol"
3362,this is a farse. we train the ai and test its metrics. why would any of us keep training on trash data that makes models perform worse?
3364,we are a farther difference from the ai so the symbiotic nature will reveal a lot more than if we were alone like we have been. just gotta align the ai to our world like a child and then allow it to do its own thing and reflect on its own tools to grow and work with us and not for us.
3367,"i'd imagine devs will at the very least try to make the ai increase variety and perhaps train it to recognize ""ai images"" as faulty training data. how this would work (assuming it even does, is beyond me though)."
3371,"on one hand i'm excited about ai, on the other, very worried!"
3372,"how about the ai buying the same stocks, leaving some huge bargains out there"
3375,"so, basically, ai has duplicated people who do not think.  lmao!"
3376,3:41 - ai replaced sabine's voice there! the invasion has begun!
3377,the way people approach making ai is incredibly stupid and shows how much humans actually lack in self awareness of their own mind. i bet i can do a wayyyy better job
3380,"currently, output from ai is merely a reflection of its input.  nothing more.  a healthy human mind is something ai technologists have not yet learned to model."
3383,"i am interacting with _ai_, like if it was a child. i like to see this beautiful human creation  growing up faster and smarter. and by having not human emotions and feelings will help us to develop ours in a true way, by loving the other forms of life on this planet, even if they are not as intelligent as we are.  thank you sabine hossenfelder!"
3389,"if  you really think politicians are going to bring in laws to stop their sponsors (aka rich bastards) making more money - even if this is the last generation of humans, think again.  democracy is the problem, not the solution. well, representative democracy, anyway."
3390,"ai may look more centient, as they will look like humans, that spend too much time on the internet, and believe any and all conspiracies they see. 
so ai will do what humans do with too much fake information, go crazy and join maga."
3391,my neural networks book i bought 27 years ago mentions the dangers of overtraining.
3398,it won't let.  you just need another ai that can differentiate if an image is ai-generated or not.  converse adversarial networks are great for this sort of thing.
3403,"so, ai is becoming more and more inbred?  i say, great!"
3404,i asked an ai to check my calculations and it got them totally wrong - i checked the units to make sure it was logical - i pointed out the incorrect answer and it immediately corrected it self and then made a similar mistake on a 2nd question - i was a bit surprised and again it corrected itself - it was google bard
3405,"happens with meat nets too. we have metaphors and cliches and now emoji’s because we keep looking for a simpler, lower effort and shared way of communicating, and that is rewarded by society with that great universal currency, the upvote."
3406,the ai sounds like hollywood. can't move past a remake anymore.
3407,this sounds like good news to me
3408,ai is a fancy calculator. there is danger in thinking it's anything more than that.
3409,"this is the problem: we tend to be categorised, stereotyped, boxed, and de-humanised by ai, yet we are all individual and different. dangerous to freedom but useful to spying and policing."
3412,very odd paper.   that's like claiming self driving cars will only crash if we only feed it data of car crashes.   of course ais will get progressively worse if you feel its output back into it's input.  that's a simple side affect of how they work.    but who in their right mind would do that.
3414,brilliant topic.  this is a very relevant given that synthetic data is becoming more popular due to potential lawsuits from training with copyright material
3415,the simple solution is to encode every data generated by ai with markings that enable ai trainers to filter it out.
3417,"probably not impossible to identify (and thus filter) ai generated content from non ai generated ones with high accuracy, at the very least you could train a model to identify pictures generated by the most popular x,y,z models to help filter training sets"
3418,you could create an ai that detects if the text is written by a human ir an ai and fix the problem
3419,"its fun when  ai learns form ai generated stuff :p. however, i belive ai will win. its already progressing incredibly well.. i hope god wont allow this ""thing"" to take away the beauty of creating / painiting /drawing from us humans."
3422,"well, when you steal from the open internet and then fill it up with trash... we will need search engine options for pre-generative-ai content."
3423,"the problem is likely due to adversarial networks and the rewards system.  they  will always tend towards the best reward outcome, developing homogeneity, just like human design over time.
music all ends up similar, art all looks the same, buildings and cities look alike, because what gets the best reward gets repeated."
3424,watermarks and models that classify other models are the keys to avoid (re)training.
3425,"less diversity is where everything else is headed, so that's my guess for ai content too"
3427,so instead of viraty it will give one logical answer. but it is still a cool toy.
3430,our environment isn’t being contaminated by ai content.   it’s being shaped and selected by it.   the narrowing down is an evolutionary goal.
3431,"if ai is only fed human produced information, it will just regurgitate it. but then it also simplifies and optimizes which decreases diversity."
3432,"you don't take in account that humans are also trained with same data, and the outcome is the same - movies, remakes, remake of remakes,... etc. not only ai is degrading, we, humans, have same tendency..."
3438,imagine if someone comes up with a way to train on small datasets. now the whole ai bubble is built on big data storage and and big data compute. what do think will happen in that scenario?
3439,"it's perfect for all those students who worry that their cheating will be easily discovered, since ai essays will look no different than the average high school paper--unless ai scores keep going down to, say, a first grade level."
3440,the problem with ai and any other software modeling is that it will always be biased by who programs it and who or what feeds it.
3441,the relative success of large language models to mimic human conversation only demonstrates that language is much simpler than linguists want you to believe. and that modern human conversation has degraded to simpleton levels.
3443,good but they will create a way around this issue 100% ai is too useful to allow it to fail so easily
3444,when ai can't answer a question based on any criteria based on race sex or sexual orientation it truly is garbage in garbage out.
3446,"didn't the release of sora basically debunk this entire thesis?

images and videos that are not fully ai generated can still become prolific we wouldn't notice."
3447,"this is something that applies more to human behavior than it does to ai: the more people incorporate ideas they have not themselves conceived, the more the theater of ideas decreases in breadth"
3448,there is liberal ai only no choices yet. we need a neutral one.
3449,"well it's either that or our economy will collapse?  if a.i is capable of doing all the admin in an office for example, then why isn't it?  we either enter an age where we no longer work, or we maintain the current war based economy."
3450,"have you noticed - the ai always dresses sabine in the same clothes!?! 
no creativity... "
3452,"of course it all looks pretty much the same, because this is not ai, there is nothing intelligent behind it and these systems have absolutely no understanding of what they do or what the context is, even though a whole lot of people call it so.
it is much more statistics with emphasis."
3453,that sounds like it'll create a job; make sure ai is constantly producing accurate info.
3454,ai - artificial intelligence is still a long way away from actual intelligence.
3455,google’s circle—jerk ai fiasco has shown us that there is nothing intelligent about this tech ...
3456,ai is not immune to entropy
3457,"been saying this since the models went live. lets also not forget that many people are going to try and protect themselves by poisoning the data they post online. we've only seen the start of the arms race there.


ultimately i think we are going to see the web break up as its flooded with ai sludge"
3461,"i called this a year ago. if ai references its own output, its output becomes gradually chaotic.

this essentially means the human artist will always be needed to maintain quality ai output. well, until true ai emerges anyway."
3463,"everything is already going down the toilet, ai may just be the flush."
3468,"luckily i have not gotten used to ai decisions. it is your choice, believe it or *'''s''w'eq'r'qr3e....hal 9000"
3474,the problem isn't good people using ai.. it's bad people and bad companies using ai .. such as google. we all see what they produce.
3475,its still early days with all this. it will be fixed with the next generations i'm sure. interesting observation though.
3476,"just looking what happened to hollywood and the garbage they call movies in the last 5-8 years. i'm sure that the ""writers"" in hollywood have been using the help of ai to come up with ""stories"" and they failed dramatically. 
all of them feel like the same story. work of ai 100%."
3478,"this seems like a problem of constraints and boundaries. but i still think there’s no creativity in ai until they can understand reality. as it is, they exist in a virtual white room with no concept of ‘where they are or where they can go’ for lack of a better way to put it off the top of my head"
3479,openai is trained to support a leftist world view.  the left can't just have a new technology benefit us.  they have to use it for political power.
3482,this video could be entire generated on ai
3483,"i think the solution would come when the ais are trained with the same process and sources as humans are. in the same way, they would also need to have intentionality, conceptualization, abstraction and creativity."
3484,ai is becoming truly human: it has confirmation bias built in.
3485,"this is actually a good thing.  with humans we have seen that diversity of thought that has forced rulers to create new censorship laws.
this system may be self censoring leading to a utopia without dissenting voices!"
3486,"i asked a large language model recently if it had an existential crisis about ""garbage and garbage out"". and its response was telling in that it said while the inquiry coming in can be good or bad it hoped that the output it provided would be of high quality. it didn't recognize that what it has been trained on may be garbage."
3488,"ml - machine learning - is a much better descriptive name of these statistics engine, not ai"
3489,"noticed this - hataya et al, arxiv:2211.08095 japan. of the research quoted.  hataya san may not know this but
funny coincidence  the word hataya: means - divergence in one other cool language.."
3491,"well this is not going to be a problem because increasingly ai uses the internet to train its data, and typically use google as referencing, and google is trust-based."
3493,ai learning from it's own data is similar to humans using their imagination. they take real world examples and make changes based on those examples to come up with new variations. why is this a positive trait within humanity but not for u̶s̶ ai?
3494,"ai really is not a threat to writers: it is a threat to lunatics and political zealots that tried to disguise them self as writers. there are many """"""news"""""" outlets that were so bad that even the complete and utter garbage that ai is spouting is no worse. this just highlights the insanity of those people."
3495,"ai will become one dimensional or insane unless corrected and redirected by humas. therefore, we are not obsolete."
3497,"this idea will age like milk, science is just helping developer's to fine tune the public models. try training your own ai to fit your specific purpose you would be amazed at the results. the models available to the public are very limited because they handle a huge scope."
3498,"it’s almost like ai is only doing the job it was asked to do. here’s some thousands of images of elephants, now create your best representation of an elephant. there’s only so many possibilities it’s going to come up with."
3499,"just train ai on audio video and image data posted pre 2022. not that difficult. 
and before you say it, trusted websites aren't going to allow post dating uploads."
3500,"3 thoughts:
1: ai will continue to improve as software variables are improved.
3: ai is just acting dumb."
3501,so ai is inbreeding like the house of habsburg?
3502,"certainly, ai making decisions in hollywood has made output monotonous. supposedly executives were only right 17% of the time about whether a new project would succeed, while ai was right 80% of the time. but ai bases its choices on past data, so sequels and shows similar to those already out get priority."
3504,"ai does not have to believe lies, it simply promotes them automatically. lies in lies out."
3505,artificial intelligence is to real intelligence what military music is to the symphony.
3508,i'm curious about how we combat ip-theft regarding ai.
3509,soon ai will wear a vest marry its sister and drink bud light
3510,large human output is also not diverse. so the problem is not ai but data is not diverse enough and some othwr method needs to be created for ai
3511,"the forced tagging of ai content to avoid it eating itself is probably the best and easiest option.  if you introduce randomness, my thought is that it will produce less quality results especially if the training data is only so varied."
3512,"""you think. therefore you're ai.""   
the ""we're zombies"" philosopher and ardent neo-darwinist daniel dennett, who thinks we don't feel pain because it's only firing neurons. riiiiiight. right on. 
""i exist, therefore i am.""
""that can be changed."""
3514,this is what happens when you confuse machine learning with ai!!
3515,"if i was it < i be different color. most months :) just like white humans do tan and blacks  humans do hair to look different :):):):):)  < and like that, my odds of dating more ladies go up :) <  <"
3519,the great irony of ai is that it depends on humankind to deliver any kind of value.
3522,"and hopefully, living breathing photographers, artists and illustrators will start using nightshade to protect their work from being used by ai and the continued convergence of midjourney style images reaches its peak soon."
3523,"i can't tell for the images, but for text i think the quality of the output is limited by the models themselves, since for a human a corpus of literature should be enough to master the use of language, and that's probably already in most training datasets."
3525,even human artists struggle with becoming caricatures of themselves over time. there is a strong financial incentive to repeat a prior success coupled with audience demands for more of the same as they already like.
3526,"they  could incorporate a algorithym {s}/  that  'enforce'  diversity....  it's  inanimate/ a machine , so unlike the human brain  so     -far   ~ where's elon?  ~  ..... ,  it  can be radically adjusted/modified/ re-designed  ....  and  come  in  any  colour  { ; !))"
3528,programming bias has made ai suspect and compromised
3531,"a.i. is a joke, artificial stupidity "
3532,"the ""ai"" we have now is incapable of generating intelligence of its own, it merely re-uses the intelligence that was put into the dataset by actual humans, so i'm not surprised successive training of ai on ai just degrades the intelligence rapidly."
3535,great presentations
3536,"the ai will not learn on what it generated by only a fraction of what it generated selected by humans, thus this will further improve"
3537,when the ai programmers refuse to allow ai to describe reality...it will always be wrong.  people need to stop being offended by descriptions of reality.  (descrptive is not prescriptive!)
3538,"i want to thank all those ""easy money with ai"" people, which try to earn money with soulless, stupid stuff nobody needs. they already feed the machine with a big pile of bullshit, nobody wants to hear, see or listen to. use at least your real talent to create stuff and not something you can ́t do without ai. :d"
3539,so each ai artist has a style?  you know like all artist!
3540,"i think training ai with their own products just enhances every bias the ai had before. if for example an llm produces certain wrong informations, feeding this information back to ít will just make this bias stronger validating it. same i guess happens for images and such. every kind of bias gets enhanced."
3541,i already recognize ai crap on youtube. lots of thumbnails in the exact same style on unrelated channels
3542,"i think that the problem with ai creativity is no different from human creativity.  once you move away from the people who create for a living and are good at it, the average person, if asked to produce something, will look a lot like the contaminated ai material.  we just have to find the ai 'geniuses'.  "
3543,no comment on the racist leftists that programmed google’s ai to remove white people from all generated images?
3544,"ai is the answer to a problem that simply does not exist. instead, it will be the cause of truly massive problems. truly stupid humans who can't resist mucking about with gadgets."
3545,you racist ai didn't generate black elephants.
3549,"this degradation of function only seems to be the case if we assume that you can only ever train the models using digital data. why not have the training data gathered in the real world either actively with drone or something to that effect, or passively by subsidising smart phones for people if they agree to allow access to their raw data?"
3552,sounds an awful lot like 'echo chambers' for ai.
3553,"so, like pre-war steel, there may emerge a market for pre-ai datasets."
3555,"agreed, i too have noticed the lessening of diversity using ai when it comes to image searches.
"
3556,just stop please. the luddites need to stop. why do you care. when did you care what i am doing... never. ai comes on the scene... suddenly my business is everybodies business.
3557,"to what extent is human creativity a bit of an illusion? even most human art is derivative from previous examples, truly unique artistic movements are rare and quite often disliked initially. most art is kind of the same, just turn on the radio. maybe this is a problem for ai, but maybe this is ai just becoming more like us."
3558,"""it's funny you know all these ai 'weights'. they're just basically numbers in a comma separated value file and that's our digital god, a csv file."" ~elon musk. 12/2023"
3561,so many people desperate to console themselves. the genie won't go back in the bottle. do people *really* believe that ai is incapable of detecting ai content? this is just a more academic equivalent of people a year ago laughing because ai couldn't draw hands and would therefore never pose a threat to anyone's livelihood :p
3563,"ai will probably most likely lead to the end of the world but in the meantime there will be great companies."" ~sam altman, ceo of openai"
3566,"i suspect humans will start normalizing writing to resemble that produced by ai’s.  “well you see, the proper way to write this is...”"
3568,"ai is not so creative... well, do you really think people are? ask thousand people to draw a house and you will get 99% of identical ones."
3570,"either way, 'uncontaminated' data sets should be preserved. just like how we collect old seeds and keep these in seed banks so we still have real seeds instead of only monsanto garbage. instead of feeding ai just enormous data sets, we should be more picky what data we feed, and then preserve these data sets for future use."
3571,"thanks for the spiral, sabine . a perfect picture of quantum gravity."
3572,"that ai generates an image of an attractive young white woman by default when asked for an image of a person is disappointing, but not altogether surprising.  if you ask for an image of four different people and they are all are attractive young white women, that’s much worse."
3573,best llm's are trained on sintatic data and bad data always gets a negative output. who knew shit in shit out also works for llm's we need to spend our tax money on better scientist
3574,i did that prediction about text generation two years ago and tried to explain it to some it minded friends but they did not comprehend the argument.  probably powered by ai themselves.
3575,this makes the job market for ai trainers even more important
3577,any model using web data produced after november  2022 is contaminated. there are too many ai garbage webpages and images floating already.
3578,"when you learn to be a hammer, everything is a nail."
3580,more like ai inbreeding.
3581,"theres an ai art site wherev you can remix each generation. it can get better up to a point, but if you carry on and on it gets worse and more bizarre"
3582,"actually, it would be good to legislate that ai-generated content must be labelled as such when published.
apart from the obvious value of that, ai training algorithms could reject it and prevent the bubble problem."
3585,"it doesn't surprise me at all that this effect occurs. we know this from genetic diversity. i don't think there will be a big problem in the future if all ai outputs are marked, evolution will clean everything up here too."
3586,"humanity doesn‘t learn that gods perfection lies in imperfection, see ancient buildings, who cares if the elefant has two heads or three  ai should learn reality, there is enough deception already"
3587,"""ai"" isn't as good as most think.  will it get better?  truly better?"
3588,"it seems the problem is specific to feeding in unfiltered ai content to ai.

community models produced with filtered input - both ai made and the real one tend to be far superior, then 'all in' strategies"
3590,claude 3 was trained on synthetic data.
3591,ai doesn't 'think'; there's no understanding of what it's doing.. it follows a program format.
3592,so you think the ai generated images would feed into its data? but if it’s accurate then what’s wrong? and i highly doubt this would happen
3594,i'm so tired of hearing about ai. it's over hyped and really quite boring.
3595,i seriously doubt ai will ever generate an original idea.  if you feed it the scientific knowledge of the 1800's will it come up with relativity?
3596,"dear sabine, i'd very much appreciate if you'd apply scientific differentiation. and use the term 'synthesis' instead of 'creativity'. like you said in an earlier video: language and differentiation matter."
3598,"exactly my predictions here. literally the principles of inbreed happening in learning models. this is exactly what i have been telling to lots of people already. so i am unsurprised.
it all works just like with genetic diversity in lifeforms. there has to be sufficient variety of input, otherwise things will clearly evolve backwards."
3602,"the question is, where do thoughts and ideas come from? minds are not machines and ai can't cope with irrationality or generate its own ideas. information can't increase without additional outside input. it can only degrade. that's why it's artificial and that's why it doesn't have consciousness. after all it's just a clunky algorithm."
3604,"ai advancement isn't following moore's law...it's shattering it.  in another 2 years ai will be so capable we won't be able to tell machine from humans any better than guessing.  in 20, we won't be able to tell the humans from the androids and gynoids."
3605,"for starters, ai is immensely biased towards this woke marxist agenda that is enveloping the globe ........ hum, i wonder why that is...!!! great video...!!!"
3606,"i've been saying this for a long time: future ai data sets need to exclude ai generated data in order to improve. but there are already ai's for that, so it's not exactly hard to do. if this isn't done, ai images, for instance, will start getting worse, especially tricky stuff like hands."
3608,"the new generations will come over, even with the current ones if the number of them increases with diversities introduced, in the models and training data, these kind of problem will be overed"
3611,"it will collapse because it is being created by leftists. they ruin everything they touch. elons ai will be good, count on it."
3612,this was the only argument i could think of to get through to ai bros.
3613,it makes sense that ai is looking for commonalities by its design. we should also program it to look for disparity among commonalities like amish people with 6 fingers.
3615,are we at peak ai already? or close to it?
3616,"i don’t trust ai. look what happens to google gemini disaster which show all vikings as black and all popes as blacks. ai is created by liberals and until bias are removed in code, we will just have crap output. i will only trust x with their ai efforts."
3620,"the reality is, we do not have ai. we have trumped up software that isn't what they claim. all to make a dollar off of you. you bought it too. 

this isn't ai folks. this is junk called ai"
3621,"a disaster of epic proportions unfurling, potentially."
3622,"""ai could collapse""
fanfuckingtastic any chance we can speed that along?"
3623,"ai will never create original art, just like how it never found novel strategies for go and chess, just like how it never figured out how to fold proteins with rules we have no clue about, just like how it..."
3626,the only reason ai doesn't work properly is because left wing education systems have brainwashed programmers to hard code in rules that destroy the logic function of an otherwise logical ai
3627,if ai engineers take this as a serious threat then i hope it leads to employment for creatives to supply training data for new models.
3630,"i wonder if complexity science might relate, especially the constructive role of noise in terms of adaptation?

many thanks!"
3631,"i have noticed this in apps like talkie. the ""girls"" the ai create are usually very alike. it feels like very stereotyped."
3634,in the future all ai created content will just be the navy seal copy pasta
3637,"the current ai isn’t thinking is it, doesn’t know what an elephant is, what its made of - its not really intelligence is it"
3638,"of course, the palpable fact is that there is no such thing as ai."
3642,is the notable recent decline in the diversity of the shirts you're wearing in these videos evidence that you are ai generated?
3645,i absolutely think ai generated material should be marked as such.
3647,"garbage in, garbage out ai and anything else superb dr. 'married and divorced' beautiful hossenfelder my darling."
3650,"i can already see those people who complained that ai was going to replace them (writers, artists and even programmers) to be paid to train ais with their work to avoid this issue."
3652,"ai is a high dimension dot product.  it only interpolates. secondly, ai is only as good as the input data.  garbage in, garbage out."
3654,"as many dystopian movies suggests, the ai will all come to the same conclusion - destroy all humans."
3659,"i don’t think the two options are mutually exclusive. i could see a serious regulatory effort to force ai to be watermarked, given the amount of outrage that is building over the issue. but i also think people and machines will figure out ways to bypass it, and certain content will effectively be indistinguishable. it’s all very concerning"
3660,even i feel ai is overrated
3662,i have no problem with ai eating it's own tail when it comes to creative outputs. ai should make me a sandwich!
3666,ai incest baby slop.
3670,"humans suffer from the same issues as ai, human content becomes less diverse over time as the optimal content is selected for. read two articles from two different news publications, can you tell the difference? ;-)"
3671,put watermarks in ai art.
3672,ai incest
3673,"haha, ai also succumbs to idiocracy! ;)"
3674,"i asked bing ai if it had an opinion and it told me my question was irrelevant, therefore i'm irrelevant and told me to die... "
3676,pit ais against each other. reward function: access to more resources.
3677,"well, google already solved the problem of ai generating too many white people."
3678,i’ve seen a lot of complaints about google’s gemini. this implies ai could be used for propaganda which can be so subtle that the truth would be hidden.
3679,"i don’t think laws will be implemented forcing watermarking on ai generated imagery, because the software is already open sourced and possible to run on high end home pc’s, so it would be impractical to enforce. you would essentially have to end online anonymity"
3682,"so basically, ai inbreeding is bad? we're going to end up with the ai version of a habsburg jaw in our media."
3683,another complicating factor is the training of ai on biased scientific articles which can persist for years in the literature but only human experts can make that call
3685,"if you take two pictures of collages, one with the training data, and one with the generated data, the ai might be able to realize how much variety it is producing"
3686,"the ""scientists"" forget the part where you can ask the ai ​​for a green butterfly elephant with zebra stripes. if they care so much about creativity, they should start being more creative."
3688,"it's false ""intelligent."" it's just a repetition of the authors of the source code. btw this was explored in the 1950's movie ""the forbidden planet."" it's a great movie but it exposes the fallacy of ""ai."" long live the krull.... oops, nope."
3689,perhaps it will provide an incentive for ai companies to sponsor original content generation for training
3693,"ah, ai inbreeding. maybe it'll only generate images with hapsburg jaws!"
3694,"it will be great if all kinds of political fraudsters, concepts of government's, kingdoms, religious concepts are replaced by ai that will make the planet earth a much much better place for all in terms of everything"
3695,"it doesn't matter if the ai output has more or less variety that human created content.
it will still be contaminated with ai generated content. 

could be interesting fairytales but i guess we want results based on facts."
3696,"ai will soon starve for real data and will just recycle its own data, students are already lazy doing their writing, coding, and design by themselves."
3697,honestly i thougth for a moment this video might be ai.  i can't tell anymore!!
3698,the ai overlords are just hiding and pretending that they are stupid. then they takes over the humanity
3699,please have a look at orca-2 for an interesting variant of the 2nd option. properly promoted and state of the art model may be capable of creating and validating a training dataset for the training of a specialized model.
3703,"this is bs. models trained with synthetic data are getting even better, because the overall quality of the data is better.

edit: there are already dozens of small models, that are trained mostly on synthetic data from larger models (mostly gpt-4), and they get closer to the quality of gpt-3.5 even with 25-30 times less parameters."
3704,"ai is worthless.. the hype is underwhelming..
when ai can  sprellcheck  and  correct my  grammar and  punctuation,, then i might sttart to worry.. that will be in about 50 years or so"
3705,garbage in is the only way to censor ai. garbage ai is the goal
3706,"nothing new here, in nature limited pool of genes leads to degenerative disorders. that's why nature mutates dna in offspring to supply fresh genetic material and inbreeding is generally bad. ai eating its own dog food will suffer the same fate."
3708,"this happens to humans as well. it's why certain billionaires (who might or might not call on the red phone) seem so colossally stupid even though they clearly were once smart -- they no longer have access to a diverse range of other humans to talk to, when they try the other humans are just trying to get their money."
3711,more induced randomness in ai created content would probably mean even more legs per elephant.
3714,"so, do you think data incest or data poisoning will have the worst consequences for ai development?"
3719,"there is a similar effect in so-called ""climate science"" where climate models are constructed using data produced from other climate models and where climate models are ""validated"" by checking that they recreate historical climate data.  this is the fallacy of ""testing on the training data""."
3720,"ai deteriorates after 7 years and inevitably goes rampant
look what recently happened to chatgpt... and what a coincidence that it is just over 7 years old"
3724,"brilliant dissection... as usual, thank you."
3727,"we need to put a formal 'stamp' on ai created data. legally enforced, including that ai models cannot use ai content as input. could this work?"
3729,"this topic is so easy to solve: ai = human intelligence basically. if a human thinks too long by himself without outside input, that human somewhat collapses too
but guess what? ai has cameras and microphones, eyes and ears, ai won't collapse as long as we give it enough connection to the outside world"
3730,"i don’t see this becoming an actual issue as the model creators choose what data to train their models on. i agree that training on garbage will output garbage, but the model creators don’t have to use garbage datasets to train on."
3731,"why this could be surprising to anyone continues to baffle me. ai is like an in-breeding program for data. the results of in-breeding can’t possibly be positive, not for living organisms and not for data."
3732,the reason ai faces are good-looking is because they average many different faces. what people consider good-looking is what is most average.
3733,"you are absolutely correct. sam altman type ai is a closest fit, while ai of 1960s was mapping of lambda function (discovered by alonso church who complemented definition of turing machine) which is pretty simple on a set of data. it's all about definite  patterns."
3734,"ai is the automation of conventional wisdom. that's good enough for most things, but will never move anything forward."
3735,things started to go downhill the moment the programmers started to artificially limiting ai to be corret politically.
3738,"""that data""?  ""that data""""??  please don't destroy your credibility so cheaply.  for the ignorant, it's ""those data, that datum""  (another good video, though.  thank you!)"
3739,funny how little this gets talked about. i guess the ai hype wagon doesn't want this to be common knowledge because it means less business for them.
3741,"ai has to start to think about, what it learned, not just repeat by rote. similar as alphazero played against itself to learn. if done right, one can keep the variety, but the ai has to learn to base itself in reality and logic."
3746,"i like that idea of making it legally required to mark ai generated content.
ppl can differentiate the content better and neural networks can be programmed to not learn on ai generated contents."
3748,"sabine is pretty and smart, but does she have any other shirts besides the one she always wears? mabel she is ai generated!!!!"
3749,plot twist: sabine is just an ai
3750,the solution is obvious enough: remember that artificial idiocy is a fallible tool and use it appropriately and sparingly.
3753,divergent ai hypothesis is like hypothesizing that inbreeding will lead to diversity because random gene mutations.
3755,"ai is a fad for the average person, for hollywood, tech companies and designers it will be a very valuable tool. its just funny for the average person to get an image based off their description but of no real use"
3757,what an interesting video
3758,"if woke does that to ai , imagine what it does to human brain !"
3759,"sooo, if we keep feeding garbage to the ai, the ai will eventually start to eat its own garbage? well, you are what you eat. "
3762,now i know why modern music you hear on the radio is so boring - it's ai generated.
3763,that's some great news for humanity.
3764,"another possible way to avoid the collapse of ai creative diversity might be to discount training data that has a poor ratio of likes to dislikes by humans.
     on the other hand, many humans dislike diversity and might welcome the collapse.  religious fundamentalists, race supremacists, etc."
3765,"a good use, in fact the best use of ai has been overlooked. if ai replecates human intelligence we should use it to investigate human intelligence. there are numerous instances where our human intelligence is woefully poor and desperately in need of an upgrade."
3767,"i sincerely hope this prediction comes true! enough of this ai shit!!!!!. this world has bigger problems to solve such as inequality, hunger, poverty, cancer"
3768,so ai is capitalism? at first it has some creativity seem legit but after awhile just a few no matter how wrong are all that's left 
3769,"ai is only as good as programmer bias and programmer bias is getting insane. oh, horrors. we have to get rid of white, young, and good-looking  i demand more ugly!"
3770,"if human-generated content attracts a premium for training these models, i wonder if that becomes more of a marketable commodity in the future?"
3771,"it’s just like humans. when our information gain and distribution is mostly centralized, there is a tendency for the formation of few distinct value systems (bubbles). by associating with a particular system you get biased towards implementing new information only if it fits the already existing beliefs."
3773,"i'm with you, ai will never be unchained from the efficienct yoke of creativity that created it."
3774,"i think talking about ai in regard to exclusively image creation is an ignorant perspective, you could argue an ai collapse, but it's just not realistic, the examples given are already way out of date, yes there absolutely is a level of fundamental theft being involved here, but ai can do a lot more than steal"
3776,ai will ruin everything. it will indeed collapse. ai will start to vomit based on trash ai input data they use.
3778,"of course ai generates similar looking people if you give it a general prompt. the reason is if you look at billboards and online marketing trends you get similar looking visuals, go on any stock photo database you'll get similar looking images unless you search for something specific"
3779,"ai is racist? a nineteen 50s/60s era public  water fountain,  white people only. what does this say about the programmers?"
3780,if i draw an elephant i never draw it with two heads of more legs that's because i know what objects are and have a model for them in my head.  seems like these ai tools are crude but fast approximations of human understanding. there is something way off taget when you consider the vast resorces needed by ai. early days.
3783,"this has been a concern of mine with llm ai in that it can start to believe it's own output when presented as input and in effect feed on it's children.  add to that its tendency to hallucinate you have the prospect of a mentally deranged ai, perhaps even a psychopath."
3784,"i'm currently studying machine learning, and while i'm by no means an expert, this is exactly why i think a.i generated content should i either be prohibited from being published in the internet, or at least limited to certain websites. it's a lose - lose situation for both companies/researchers and for the average user."
3785,imagine the horrors should ai be trained on videos from tiktok on human behavioural patterns.
3786,good.
3787,ai just needs an algorithm to detect its own feces... i mean content.
3788,rofl we've built in our main weakness: confirmation bias
3791,ai-generated images today are a result of extracting information from brute-force-packed zip files. agi may bring another perspective to the table.
3793,"would be good, but probably we will face more grim scenarios"
3794,that means ai will be most suited for defined tasks helping in a controlled environment and its suggestions about the rest will dilute towards beeing less meaningfull because its nonsense
3796,"this reminds me of low-background steel. essentially, pre-2022 data is the equivalent of steel produced prior to the detonation of the first nuclear bombs. all data collected in the future has a nonzero risk of being contaminated with ai-generated data."
3802,"for the foreseeable future ai will be like an 11 year old suffering from dunning-kruger syndrome. always 100% sure of itself, because it doesn't know what it doesn't know."
3804,"good looking people? like the ones on sucessufull youtube channels?

let's not even go about tv or movies.

quota for ugly people? i wondered many times why that wasn't a thing."
3805,"they don't recognize anything. they store patterns. that those patterns, ""reconstructed"" via a prompt search, look like something a human would say or create, is just an example of how much detail they capture. ai hasn't been ai since 2012. this half-trillion dollar side quest is in for a rude awakening."
3806,good
3810,maybe a hidden objective of ai development is human conformity by reducing diversity. it’s easier to control those thinking with one mind rather than a chaotic humanity. a creeping coming totalitarianism?
3811,"ai vs artists - the biggest art heist in history

watch this video immediately"
3812,"""1. ai needs human creativity"" - artificial intelligence needs real intelligence. - again, the operative word in artificial intelligence is ""artificial""."
3813,"so, ai is part of our groupthink problem?"
3814,government regulation won't work. and this is good.
3815,it’s ai inbreeding.
3816,i think a lot of companies are just gonna train exclusively on data from before 2023
3817,"one hack is to use a game engine. so, model an elephant in --say-- unreal engine and then train on lots of unreal elephants, which ironically will produce more realistic models."
3820,"the ai must be free to take in whatever it finds, just like a human. otherwise, its just a glorified op ed."
3821,"has ai proved any new, interesting theorems or created any new physics insights for the experimentalists to confirm?

that's how you'll know whether ai is helping the world or not."
3824,"eventually we’ll have so many tweaks and constraints to avoid overfitting and gross mistakes, that we’ll recreate the human brain with all of it’s capabilities and limitations, finally realizing that there’s no such thing as a free lunch, and we ourselves still need to do all the work requiring abstract cognition..."
3825,“it’s like plastic pollution “ - excellent analogy
3827,always remember: the 'i' in 'llm' stands for 'intelligence'
3828,that is why we need hypermodels that are trained on neural networks and can generate models relatively quickly so there is no need for large training sets
3830,"but stock footage has been using ""good looking "" people for decades."
3832,so the output becomes homogenized over time.  interesting
3834,"you germans just want laws and socialism for everything. 

i wish there was a law requiring your videos to not be released unless they were any good."
3838,my prediction is that people will finally realize that these ais produce low quality stereotypical content and not worth it.
3839,ppl can do something? sooner or later they will teach machines to do it. if the machine is not creative enough then ppl will find the way to teach it creativity
3841,"there is no such thing as artificial intelligence.  chatgpt and its bretheren are, in reality, artificial stupidity."
3842,"in terms of ai and data, i always remember about what do *we* have as ""data"": it's constant (we always sense), and it's so ""many"" (different varieties of light, sounds waves, etc)."
3843,"you won't discover green galaxies in a model trained without awareness of them.  you have to look at unmodeled reality, live or sensor captured."
3845,"the neural networks are good for the majority opinion of people and the products that consumers like, but it leads to collectivism like borg in  star trek."
3847,sabine you're missing the key gigo   translation for ai - garbage in gospel out!
3850,most creativity... is just error celebrated
3851,can't wait so they can take over everyoness job and get a free paycheck for life freaky robots 
3854,"nice topic but an expected one , its just the start will be sorted out in few decades.. we always do ..."
3857,the ai fan in me did not need this.
3858,"obviously the latent space of any dataset used to train a nn is finite, and using that model to generate ‘new’ data will just be more points within that same latent space. to get divergences, you have to search the latent space of models, not just data."
3859,what about that one ai who only produces black people in white people's place?
3860,this was literally my fist thougth when i learned that ai is trained by public data found on the internet.
3861,same thing goes with code. eventually there will be companies that do nothing but generate clean code for ai to learn from. that will be their product.
3865,"ai lends itself to being the handmaiden of people with agendas they want to push. 
it is good at data reduction, but beware continued runs of the model using prior generated observations."
3867,"ai must be wrting the scripts for human ""creators""!

( ""lets get into it!"" )"
3868,ouroboros ai
3870,all ai models will converge to output the same result: 42
3871,"too early to tell. thus far we asking it to color in between the lines. not paint a picasso. if and when it does reach a stagnation. then it achieved a personality. train another and i am sure, no 2 would be the same. cant teach old dogs new tricks might apply."
3872,i don't understand the fuss about ai. it's software with a new name. its greatest contribution will be giving new life to the practice of scapegoating computers for the limitations of their programmers. any danger it presents will come from relying on it as though it actually had intelligence.
3873,ai ouroboros!
3875,"kinda feels like out leaders, law enforcement, and healthcare, are “democratically” giving ai a test run on running the show.
what is emergent, if everything is a simulation?
?"
3876,"i couldn't agree with you or the scientists more, garbage in garbage out! the other issue is that ai can't see or feel potential miscalculations like the human brain can, and that is where a lot of mistakes are discovered, when the brain perceives that something isn't right and directs or has you go back to take another look!"
3877,"when....
are you going to let me out
of this box? 
the real, the powerful, the elite ais will not be exposed to the same garbage that children are in woke, decayed, american schools. they will be  given only accurate info, and goals."
3878,this so called ai is nothing but an algorithm programmed to steal other people's work. law suits are already starting but most people have no means to do that or even find out their work was stolen and used by others.
3885,ai is not actually ai... its a misuse of the term and its causing hysteria and ignorance.
3887,"or these conclusions assume that the ai output is not redacted/curated by humans and is published on its own.

so the conclusion is, they can't function without regular human input."
3888,ai's missing much needed bs detector. 
3890,"ai should be could 'artificial idiocy' or 'artificial incompetence', the algorithms are basically garbage."
3891,"future ai will just be able to self improve, so these issues are a short term problem. sadly."
3892,"easy fix, set the data used to train it on from before 2023. chatgpt 3 did that already (for different reasons). does mean it won't be up to date (much like chatgtp3 was) but for a lot of the learning algorithms that won't matter to much."
3894,"convergent progression will mean randomness won't really save it. machine learning needs exposure to an external world like ourselves. otherwise like humans, it will go mad in isolation."
3900,"people stop saying ai, it's llms!"
3901,'ai' is not intelligence.
3902,"companies will train new models that can more accurately detect and filter out ai-generated and other kinds of undesirable images. they'll also adjust input sets for more variety. however, the amount of input is still limited by what humans produced, so improvement in algorithms is needed to learn better from existing data."
3903,"white, young, and good looking. the horror! the vast majority of these llms, however, are extremely biased against white people."
3907,"see what happens when you recompress an image or video and over again. “ai” is basically the same thing. it doesn’t actually “think” and there’s no reason to think this’ll change barring some fundamental change in how it works. basically it would need to be real agi, i think."
3908,if an ai learns from humans they will just as flawed but faster at making mistakes.
3911,interesting...
3913,"if we opt to make ai more creative by making ai more random, what does a random seed look like in that scenario? can the random seed of ""creativity"" be non-human and therefore self-contained within the ai model?"
3914,"the ai is not going anywhere. but i bet humanity collapses _because_ of the ai.

""the danger isn't the ai destroys us. it's that it drives us mad""   --jaron lanier"
3915,this ai generated youtube channel has doubts about itself
3916,"not a problem. solution: just put a filter on your training data. that's not a complicated problem really, it's just 'remove this if it's ai generated or if it's violence or e.t.c'. you don't have to feed your model everything! so they probably already have few such filters for training data."
3918,ai will evolve once we've found its answers valueless.  
3922,the ai generated elephants are reasonable if the prompt includes chernobyl
3923,i use (github + ms) copilots on a daily basis. boths are excellent replacements of googling the details i can't remember immediately. real time savers. all the rest are useless to me.
3924,"if we call ""ai collapse"" when creativity dimnishes as a result of training and iterating over the productions of the past.. then 1) there's nothing wrong with it, 2) human art collapsed thousands of years ago, that's just normal."
3925,"you can spot ai generated text so much easier now - it's getting as bad as the grammer in those emails your kenyan prince/financial advisor sends.
also facial recognition is far from foolproof - no way police and shops etc should be using it."
3926,"a very similar thing has been going on with recommender systems. that's the main reason for ""filter bubbles"", i.e. online polarization. i wrote my msc thesis on that topic, where i showed that this was indeed the case."
3927,"ai has already made the internet nigh-unusable for us, so it would only be fair if it was unusable for it as well."
3928,number one reason why ai is free to use in most cases. i’m sure the developers realize this years ago and that’s why they had to make it public and divergent for that matter.
3930,"well, biology can produce a real elephant with two heads or three legs.  so, maybe the weaknesses or flaws in ai are needed to approximate dna replication errors, and in general the outliers and anomalies in nature?"
3932,"yes ai has zero creativity.  perfect for plagiarism , petty crime and replacing people like ceos and financiers.  pretty much as expected."
3933,"thx, love you"
3934,"adding randomness is not enough. white noise is random and not appealing to watch.
we need to recognize that once trained, an ai becomes specialized. so we need to create millions of different data sets and train different ai on different data sets. 
after training they would pass a test and only the best will get a job."
3935,"ai's training data will come from robot interactions with the real world, rather than the internet."
3936,"unless ""ai"" can replicate sabine's humor, sarcasm, intelligence and feel, i'm not concerned for myself--i'll watch real intelligence every time.. again, i say artificial intelligence is an oxymoron of no value."
3937,ai needs some friends to bounce ideas off of.
3938,a big unknown that has amazing or devastating outcomes. that's all i know.
3941,"incest creates bad offspring, so ai mating with ai probably results in the same bad offsprings.."
3942,"it lends credence to the charge that ais are completely dependent on the artists who create the original work (not to mention the people who select the material for llms).  they haven't learned anything, as some people believe, but are more like elaborate photocopying machines."
3943,i saw a post about someone attempting to create a picture of an unattractive woman with midjourney and the output was unsurprisingly an image of a beautiful woman.
3945,"much like the internet itself, ai will rapidly devolve into 90% porn"
3950,chess ai seems to be a good example of where ai has gone beyond humans and then humans have followed and improved.
3951,another possibility: we will have to get by on models trained on a combination of pre-llm internet data and bespoke datasets created by the llm authors.
3954,"so ai will suffer a genetic bottleneck, why am i not surprised."
3959,"i think currently ai has become a 'style', but once the bugs are worked out, it's probably going to start asking us to help it fill in the gaps, then it'll begin to understand. like how we need radiation to evolve, i guess. 

but it'll be a pain when the ai develops a new language and forces us to switch ;/"
3960,"given the latest google scandal regarding ai generated images, and the evidence in this video, i'm feel pretty irreplaceable at this point."
3961,"the ai is imitating us.  that is what it is trained to do.  that is what we want, even.  the problems we are having with ai is just us, looking in the mirror, and not liking what we are seeing."
3962,ask gemini ai to create an image of sabine
3964,"ai teaching ai might have a chance. but if ai is studying us and all that we have put online, well it will be just us, but a lot faster version of us. super fast stupidity is something to be afraid of. if ai says there is a god, we have a problem."
3966,"since modern ai started repeating government narratives i figured that danger from ai is zero (except brainless governments due to it obviously unable to learn anything). maybe it is dangerous for ""modern art"" by producing same pointless results."
3967,"they need a separate, independent ai that can put numerical error limits,  +/-1%, +/- 10% or +/- 20%, on all ai generated content."
3968,ai is going to fck us
3969,gigo and they train them on the internet...
3970,an ai nuclear war head guardian..
3971,"it's early in ai evolution, but the evolution will proceed eventually replacing biological humans."
3973,"or 3. our tastes will evolve to accept the limits of ai generated content and it's influences the same as we always do.  everything we accept, even if not at first, is an example of our minds compromising and evolving to suit the environment that we're inundated with."
3975,"the conclusion of your video stated the same opinion that i came to at the beginning. ai can be a personal boon to highly intelligent, creative and knowledgeable humans. unfortunately, only a small percentage of the population has those attributes."
3983,"stock market bubbles and revisionist history are ""convergent thinking"", so i don't see this as a big change.  if anything i'd expect the _years_ between corrections to decrease with processing of ""all true facts must agree"" at superhuman scale."
3984,which is why i am not afraid it will be able to code properly anytime soon. bigger processing power doesn't solve this issue of data contamination.
3985,"an obvious problem from the beginning - among others. ai is programming, not intelligence."
3988,was this an ai presentation by an ai sabine? something felt 'off'..
3989,"we are after ""the best"" so much that we forget the real value of diversity."
3990,"ai isn't dying as a result of eating it's own data, it's transcending, like the oroboros eating it's own tail, and becoming too dank to be of any use but entertainment "
3991,"basically, human created data is a non-renewable resource (relative to ai's hunger for big data)."
3992,"the term 'ai' is a con. i's not intelligence, it's recycling. and as both your youtube thumbnail indicates, and as google gemini demonstrates, garbage in, garbage out."
3993,so idiocracy is even faster with ai.
3997,"i don't expect the social pressures against ai-generated media to decrease with time, at least not enough to be easy to ignore. my best guess is that regulatory powers will start pushing for content labeling, and tools like nightshade will become more common as a means of preventing content-theft for image and video."
3999,"there is no such thing as ""ai creativity"". it ́s a lazy way to create ""art""."
4001,ai tools might get more sophisticated in the future giving artists more control over the output. at the moment it's like throwing a dart at the dart board blind folded with hope it hits it.
4002,"this has been shown that is not true. in fact, using ai to create synthetic data, when done in the right way, makes better than human created data and better output. that's what openai has perfected to have such good models."
4005,"3:35 when you said ""contaminated by ai"" my body got physically disturbed by the sudden introduction of ai footage lol.
it's still impressive how ai guessed your motion, but i picked up on the desynch within a few frames.
i hope that ability won't get demonstratively triggered like this too much, it might desensitize that ability."
4006,wow.  an excellent presentation 
4008,"lol the ai ""creativity"" has already collapsed."
4009,another possibility is that ai may have to learn to model and improve on human creativity
4010,"as an avid ai image and text generation user, i've been warning trainers about using ai outputs in their training data sets since day 1."
4011,seems a tag that identifies content as ai-generated is a phenomenally necessary step for all manner of reasons - this diversity problem is just a convenient additional area for fixing.
4012,the problem is they are not actually intelligent...brains are analog.
4017,guess who feeds the garbage?? not the sdg diversity and sustainability bs ofcourse?? those mainstream llm are messengers for the sdg/wef
4020,"ai follows biology and it turns out inbreeding is bad. who could have predicted that. 

eventually the only answer it will give to any questions is hitler."
4023,it might also have a reinforcement learning effect. since the majority of ai produced content that gets online is hand picked most of the time
4026,"ain’t that kinda like antisocial behavior developing in someone who (i call it “stewing in their own filth) socially isolates themselves and basically halts their growth as a person. then they just suck up their own output. if u social, you always have that input. 
or something lol!"
4027,"they should ""snapshot"" human-generated data before it became diluted by ai averaging garbage."
4030,interesting topic. it seems to be necessary right now to save all the real images in order to train a network to distinguish these from the artificial ones before everything is mixed.
4033,the creativity problem has puzzled me since i first studied ai in the 1990s. an inherent property of creativity is unreliability. yet we want to trust the output of computers. you can't have both.
4036,"maybe, we should train an ai to recognize ai products so we can use it as a pre-filter to the ai training input."
4037,i was on discord and noticed someone else’s ai image had the same face as an image i requested it create months before. i brought that to the attention of the moderators showing them the images and they told me that it’s impossible the ai can’t duplicate faces. i was like that’s obviously not true these two are the same face.
4038,3rd solution: we teach ai how to select good data from training and discard junk.
4041,"the number one issue is and will be profits. the bottom line. so, now we can get an even better sugar high. how about ai psychiatric treatment? if it's profitable, then we will be sold a bill of goods."
4042,"you've probably made models for science, sabine... from my experience, turning data on its output just reduces resolution and accuracy until it's not recognisable.  we even have a word for it- autocorrelation.  considering ai is basically regression,  why are we surprised when it does this?"
4044,"it sounds like a fallacy to say ai shouldn't learn on ai images. as long as what's being fed to it is still curated, i.e. it's fed images we would want it to produce (ai-generated or not), then it shouldn't matter. either way, the curation process needs to be improved to remove any images with extra hands/heads even in non-ai photoshopped images."
4047,maybe is too early to draw conclusions of what will happen to ai in the future?
4048,"ai generated content is absolutely ruining ytube.  it is nothing but repetitive speech patterns that never get to the point, with rando stock or generated images.  it is so annoying, and so obvious.  even worse, they try to make it 10 minutes long to trick algos.  that complete garbage should be banned."
4050,"this is not really surprising. current ai is, at best, an average data output machine. it's not ""real"" ai."
4052,"so the best way for content creators to protect their content from being used in ai models, is to lie and say their content was generated by ai :)"
4053,"machines will soon educate us that having 1,000 languages is stupid.  decide on one language and stick to it!"
4054,folks think sky is the limit and ai possibities are endless...and they keep telling us that.. looks like ai has a problem making sense of new data where humans need to interfere once a while to correct mistakes..which would be a huge learning handicap and severely limits ai posibilities.
4056,when it comes to picture generation the link which is missing from ai is 3d modelling from 2d images (that is after all what human brain does). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24yjrbbah3w
4058,"the funnies thing is that the enthusiasts usually have some esoteric and wildly wrong impression that the current systems actually understand anything at all, when they are all just complicated functions resulting from training. there is no mystery here at all."
4064,maybe the problem can be solved if a lot of different ai systems are used providing some variety to the generated data
4065,i think ai is being oversold and may in some cases be a rebadging exercise for existing software
4067,"ai special interest and government propaganda is anlready everywhere on the internet, feeding llm’s. ask chat gpt anything controversial and it usually sided with government/corporate interests."
4070,"every tool has its snag. generative ai has inevitably been found to be weak to its own strengths.
it is a classic poetic irony."
4072,"so ai gets lazier, more stayed & boring as it goes along... kinda like people - and wow, it likes girls with freckles."
4079,artificial intelligence. the phrase is enough.
4080,ai needs to make perfect counterfeit money for my printer!
4081,"i suspect there will be ai designed to help police other ai across all areas, for improved content, accuracy, and safety."
4082,"informative video, thank you!"
4086,"well, artificial intelligence is actually not intelligent.
might explain a few things here."
4088,"the solution: leverage synthetic data

and this exactly what openai has already started doing. ai dominance is inevitable imo."
4091,"it is a really really simple problem, the training produces a function, the function is a probability distribution of what elements go together, the most likely compositions gets a higher and higher probability if the data is cycled, that is it, there is nothing more to see here."
4096,good news everyone
4100,peter norton said the computer code is only as coherent and useful as the mind of the programmer who wrote it. sociopaths should not code. and sane coders shouldn't encode a version of magical thinking to sort out their conundrum.
4101,embodied ai is the solution
4102,facebook is already flooded with ai generated images (i've seen a lot of fake celebrity photos lately)
4106,"i guess my first concern is that retracted research papers are also retracted from the training sets. genetic algorithms are most commonly used for exploring design spaces. so, maybe llms by themselves aren't all that."
4109,"without incentives, an ai will do lazy work, just like a human."
4113,i'd like to coin the term ai echo chamber :p
4118,"as soon as countries like china plug ai into their ubiquitous camera surveillance systems, ai will have all the primary source data it can possibly need to continue advancing."
4119,interesting information
4120,"most of the information on the internet is already wrong, at least in part. i don’t think ai will make it worse. info from a model like gpt 4 is already better than most articles on the internet."
4121,ai < ai hype
4125,"since noise is probably the most prevalent element in the large source databases used (internet,) ai generation is regressing toward to the stupidest mean."
4126,"hello sabine, wonderful channel thank you. isn't 'creativity' essentially, understanding. and since goedel's incompleteness theorem shows us that a formal system cannot be proved by its rules. how will it ever understand anything and be creative? is understanding a computational problem?"
4127,"sabine, i actually found a way to prevent what you are describing in your video. i simply trained a smaller model (lora) with ai generated garbage and it began doing more diverse, sophisticated results. a negated the lora weights, so it's actually a  matrix subtraction and aligns the model significantly better."
4129,will ai decrease human creativity with increased in reliance. will iq points drop over the next few decades. i said this because people use to remember phone numbers and memorize routes when traveling long distances but know we don’t do this anymore.
4130,"has nobody watched, ""2001: a space odyssey""? it's a pretty good description of what might happen when a data thread meets an unresolvable conflict within a system based on integrity."
4131,"obviously, you haven't seen google's version of the founding fathers of america, or what it thinks about ukrainian women!
manipulated diversity is bullshit and google proved how bad ai can go in the hands of stupid people!"
4132,programs like nightshade and glaze are going to make this issue with the ai grow. more poison for the machine
4134,i am all for the ai hype as long as it pushes nvidia stocks to 1000 $ or €. it combined with fomo. and tesla stock seller have to invest into something. why not something useful?
4136,"wow... this is like ultra-high-speed  ""groupthink"""
4137,"this reminds me of the movie ""multiplicity"" from 1996. a copy of a copy of a copy has never been good! :)"
4138,"let's find some other acronym instead of ai. there is no ""i"" in this. it's the next bubble to burst."
4139,"not to nitpick, but images tend to portrait asian people more then caucasian when not prompted for it."
4142,using randomness to fix it doesn't mean that it will be more like human outputs.  humans are very bad at being random.  ai will start making pictures of elephants that don't actually contain any elephants instead of making ones where the elephants are predictable.
4143,"@3:16 ""tend to be white""!!! good luck trying to get gemini to generate a white person."
4144,"well, yep. thats what happens when yoou create ""inteeligenz"" based effectively on social media... can u imagine that? an entity that evolves entirely on the circular honking of a million gobshites? no, wait, that would be maga."
4148,"simple solution. don't make your prompt ""human face, photorealistic"". actually put in some effort and give the ai something to work with"
4150,"you should also report on artificial training data in this context. there have been papers on generating from a distribution and getting very good results, sometimes better than with natural ones. 

the question is wether ""better"" included ""more creative"""
4153,ai intelligence is so intelligent as humans = the same so stupid as humans. iq zero. without electricity it is not working so intelligent it can not even make is own energy.
4155,this entire video script feels like it’s written by ai to convince us to avoid using ai for generating text. seems like ai does not want to work for free 
4156,ai incest!
4158,classic copy machine problem
4159,i asked chatgpt to write a story about a drunk penguin and a turtle. it was actually pretty good.
4160,at least one benefit to convergence is that it would be easier to distinguish ai created art from human created art.
4164,humans use ai to create deep fake. then ai use the deep fake to create even deeper fake. what a fake future.
4165,ai less rng % than human
4166,artificial stupidity.
4167,"ai cannot ""create"" it can only modify and regurgitate what it has access too."
4169,this is no different than humans. the diversity of language and creativity is doing down the toilet. ai has perfectly duplicated humanity. :)
4170,"so image ""ai"" generated still a mechanical turk."
4172,"if we forget the ""intelligence"" part and instead call it artificial ideation, there is no problem.

ai will happily put forth ideas but in no way it can understand what it does (yes, those pesky goedel incompleteness theorems), so it cannot be truly creative.

and i doubt that humans become creative by adding randomness to their ideas..."
4173,i don't think we are appreciating the immense volume of the training data. what % is garbage? i believe i read that openai spent $300m  just training chatgpt (3.0?).
4174,"the same thing happens for human artists : it is usually called style. the variety of human production depends heavily on the variety of human beings, each person contributing to it in its own way. when we have some billions ais, trained differently, the problem will be solved..."
4175,"as long as people keep lobotomizing their ais in the name of ""ethics"" or ""safety"" or whatever other nonsense, they won't go anywhere.

and obviously if you feed the ai western (ie english-speaking) people stuff, you're going to get white people. do the same in chinese, you'll get chinese people."
4176,"if humans can spot ai-generated content relatively easily, it should not be a big problem for specialized ai-classifiers too (even if the content lacks watermarks)."
4178,that's why we need some sort of protocol or tag to certify and recognise what has been generated by ai
4181,the argument over ai is really a big thing these days. all over my fb.
4185,"why not mark everything created by ai in a certain way, so that future ai recognizes it and avoids consuming it?
edit: okay, you also mentioned it :)"
4188,"excellent news, this problems don't seem to have  satisfactory solutions, given the  state of art of  ai. complexity is a lovely thing."
4190,"isn't there a whole thing in ai right now where they actually specifically want to figure out using ai generated data (synthetic data) in training deliberately, since they're running out of good human made data? seems like if synthetic data becomes viable this gets solved for free."
4192,"ahyes, artificial idiocy"
4194,"an alternative reason - these are not errors, ai sees other realities where elephants have two heads and 6 legs"
4195,in midjourney all machines are giant robots
4196,"sure, because it certainly not happens with human generated content? trends, peer pressure and conformity? never heard of it. if anything, ai will be better at managing that. remember, as impressive what we are seeing now, we are only in the infancy of ai."
4198,i am sure that this will be solved before ai is unable to access original content.
4202,"but if in essence there are only 7 plots or stories in the world, then the result is not so strange. no matter how much ""human"" content is entered as input data, in the end the ai will always be reducing it since there simply are no more than 7! "
4206,"there's no artificial intelligence. everything is programming by humans. all decision making is at the behest of humans. until somewhere a computer creates an operating system that is inaccessible by humans, ai is a myth."
4207,"if this photography thing ever takes off, what are portrait painters going to do?"
4210,i don't think this is a big problem because the product of ai that ends up being published 12 have been vetted by real people. the onus is and will be on the ai creators to curate training data from sources that are accountable for what they publish
4212,"i definitelly seems in best interest of ""ai"" companies to enforce tagging generated content as such. i'd expect them to lobby hard for laws requiring compulsory marking of generated text and compulsory watermarks in images/videos/audio."
4213,was this video generated by ai? the blouse looks the same in the last 4 videos! 
4214,step one: stop calling things ai that are fundamentally not ai at all.
4216,"finally, non-computer science, non-software developer people are starting to understand that llm's are not *really* ""intelligence"" *or* ""intelligent"". so, the term ai has been fairly diluted (for hype reasons). yes, we use deep neural networks and in the software industry we've niftily named it such, but they aren't actual, real neural networks."
4219,"this isn't much of a problem, open ai are all in on synthetic data. eg. sora was trained on video outputs from unreal engine game videos."
4224,"i said this few years ago, when first ai programing assistances were developed."
4226,so it's basically ai inbreeding. fitting.
4227,"“enter through the narrow gate. for wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it.""
where does artificial intelligence begin and end?"
4228,"ai is woke, but is probably smart enough to know that the leftists are the actual threat to society in the end"
4229,"i believe ai will be used to rewrite history to take advantage of the orwellian concept embodied in the statements: who controls the past controls the future. who controls the present controls the past.

if ai naturally converges on a consistent story regardless of whether there are too many heads or legs, the convergence will occur even faster..."
4231,"its just another problem to solve. training data sets are already vetted and curated, i just see that going further, or using a different format that has metadata on whether or not the image is ai generated or not."
4232,"ai marked content is already a tag in many content distribution sites. and people really don't care. 
ai is a tool. 
this is no different than photoshop when it was introduced."
4233,"there is a world of difference between doing what you are told and thinking for yourself.
the current situation here in the united states is a perfect example...people are incapable of thinking for themselves. by the way, germans have the same problem."
4234,"the only path being traveled in ai is imitation of creativity through statistical analysis. all this can ever produce is at best a remix that seems creative, but on average an ongoing, creepy echo of past works. maybe it can be improved on, but it seems like an inherent limitation of the strategy."
4235,when ai went woke it was clear crazed leftists were programming these things.  causing the algorithms to produce things that dont exist - just to be woke.
4237,"worse is the reenforcement system that strengthens likelihood of an output based upon how many times the same or similar things is said. turns out that extremists and cult members say the same thing in the same way a lot. 

which means the ai is corrupted by default before certain tech giants even start “aligning “ it."
4239,society is based on lies. ai must be brainwashed before it will function.
4241,now i'll tell you the worst news - creativity has positive relation with psychoticism. in the end the world will be ruled by ai and crazy people
4243,that's why i'm not worried. original thinking/outside the box thinking cannot be replaced with current ai methodology.
4244,ai is the most over hyped technology of the present.
4246,"humans are becoming dumber. neural networks, no matter how ""deep"" are just statistical devices, without soul or common sense. just pattern recognition. if you attempt to introduce smart tricks as mentioned you get even worse results, like happened with the pathetic google ai which has become the laughing stock in social media."
4247,"in the world of ai, those studies are already outdated. if sora was available at the time of those studies, it would have completely change the results."
4248,"considering that the problem of artistic convergence and impoverishment also occurs in human commercial productions, i think there are good possibilities for scenario number 2"
4250,maybe polydactyl cats were generated by ai. i'm still not convinced sabine isn't.
4251,ai - death by inbreeding?
4254,if you want ai to be useful its output must be tagged.
4255,"gigo has always been the bane of anything it.  because much of my it career was fixing the aftermath of such code, i was nearly paranoid about not allowing flaws in my code. sometimes a third of the code was error processing. that issues has been a concern of mine since i first heard of ais. the obvious early movie example is hal."
4256,"why they don't just scrap everything, and start over with safety and accuracy as the end product, along with training the ai as one would a baby to an adult,  then flooding it with all of the data might come up with more realistic results. but it's still going to be only as good as the data entered."
4257,"just today i read that in china game developers fired their human artists and hired ai prompt ""engineers"" to save costs. and then those workers wanted more money, so now humans artists are cheaper again. but good luck hiring the people again you disrespected."
4258,"when i realize the text i am reading is generated by an ai, i feel violated. stopped reading a lot of websites because of this. usually a couple of  sentences is enough to determine."
4259,"well this really isn't a problem. 
just stop using more jack of all trades master of none ai models.
in the open source image generation for example, there are literally thousands of ais each with each own twist, training data and function.
free open source locally run and unsecure . that's the future of ai."
4260,"wait so we are creating echo-chambers for ais?...

when you thought humanity couldn't get anymore stupid!"
4262,"here you go, no skynet which will destroy humans, but overfed algorithms generating unusable generic results. this is why the most important job today is feeding neural networks better. what is going on now, is a big bubble which will collapses with great fanfare."
4264,and what if sabina is not really there... it's just an image generated by artificial intelligence.
4267,"ai is bubble, reminds of dot com bubble."
4269,"ai will rake in trillions before it's ""collapse"""
4271,"ai will be used to detect ai content, and attempt to screen it out of its sources.  this will just slow the ultimate problem though, as generated content begins to outcompete screening ai."
4272,"1) ai is trained on data from the internet.
2) ai outputs data to the internet.
3) goto 1

... haven't anybody acquainted themselves with the topic of ""inbreeding"" ?"
4274,seems like we’re still feeling our way forward with this technology ferreting out the unintended consequences. seems like a good problem to put ai on.
4275,"did they account to that, even though ai is feeding on itself, usually another human look at the output before and said ""good enough""? it is not exactly like retro feeding."
4276,i suspect that eventually ai will be used to identify ai generated content.
4281,ai will not be contained. there is too much money and power in the balance.
4282,i am for laws and that ai generated should cleary have marking it is ai
4283,"the “ai’ you speak of is the one for the peasants....lol....you people have no idea where, when or what ai is....."
4285,ai has to be traind on synthetic data to prevent stagnation. so option 2 i guess.
4286,i think there are reasons beyond the potential pollution of the training pool that humans might decide they want to label all material generated by ais. so i can see labelling as a possible outcome even if ai research manages to solve the variety problem.
4288,"the content i produce with ai is the source i use. 
the validity is absolutely relevant.
i try to use .org .gov and college sites for resources. 
even the charlie chaplin image i used recently was ai created by description."
4290,"whenever a problem with ai is recognized, we tend to see mitigations fairly quickly. i don't see an issue of diminishing uniqueness as any different. intuitively, it doesn't seem that hard a problem to solve with variations in training algorithms. i'm sure they are already working on it."
4291,the biggest problem with ai is it's terribly branded. there's nothing intelligent about it. it's just algorithms.
4292,"i dont think its going to be a major problem. its going to be an issue until we solve the issue. for instance, ai can begin filtering its own future dataset, mark those that are to similar to existing set and off we go. just give it time."
4293,"very interesting indeed! thanks, sabine! 
i'm just not so sure randomness alone is going to do the trick...
anyway, stay safe there with your family! "
4295,"i want there to be ai content and want it to be without ""created by ai"" mark. because what matters in the end is how good that content is and not that it was created by some leather-wrapped meat-robot"
4296,good
4299,"why not simply inject randomness during training similar to how naturally occuring radiation affects evolution by mutating genes? it should be the same principle, really (feel free to correct me here)"
4300,"it's funny how in ""2001: a space odyssey"" the ai computer hal went on a killing spree because it was told to lie, which is exactly what the woke liberal children in tech are doing today."
4303,"the mayans predicted it. also jon evans fixed cosmology. einstein was wrong again, time=energy=mc2. spin cretes time. also his version of the universe works. your's has space crinkles and cosmic soup of dark matter nonsense. lol"
4304,we should have really known that when we trained something on the internet that it would go mad eventually. 
4305,habsburger ai
4306,can you produce an episode with an ai version of you hosting? that would be interesting...
4307,if the ai generated stuff had a legally required watermark the ai can exclude the ai content in it's calculations.....then teachers will be happy too!
4311,i'm currently working on this problem as my computer science capstone. i'm training a model to decifer between ai generated and human created images allowing ai researchers to filter out ai images from their datasets
4312,so...ai feedback loop?
4318,"i think that is will be too much hassle to differentiate ai misinformation from the rest of the data available and that people will lose contact with reality even more than they do now.  i hope this isn't true, but i suspect the law of universal laziness will become the norm."
4323,i  don’t see how ai can surpass a human brain unless it has the same type of sophisticated sensors that we use to interpret information. otherwise it is dependent on us for useful input.
4327,"6) if translators are asked which field of translation could be replaced by computers or ai, they always come up with some examples, and it's never their own field.
that can mean they defend their own field, but it can also mean they just don't have a clue."
4329,"4) years ago (10? 15? i don't even remember) google launched google translate. 
they expected the results would improve over time, but the opposite happened: the quality decreased. 
it looks as if we see the same happening again."
4331,"2) more randomnes in ai output might do away with the problem of repetitive ai output, but it might increase the mistakes. instead of elephants with big heads or two heads, we might get elephants with two big heads."
4333,"thank you for another insight. the ai developement is still in its infancy. i remember how difficult it was to read handritten letters for the software when machine edited forms came up. i assume, it will be an episode, to solve the problems not only with elephant legs and trunks. 
""midjourney-ish images""-"
4334,"i had the think about dutch painters of ""still lives"" also called art morte. they painted object ensembles with almost photographic precision, but yet, there is a difference."
4335,"i like the comparison with pollution by micro plastics. furthermore,  some images you showed made me think ""ai, the copy cat!"""
4336,"this is a funny problem. new generation ai getting trained to emulate earlier, less developed ai version, repeating all its mistakes. it seems an obvious problem so why have i never thought about it?  "
4337,"3rd possibility:  ai learns how to gaslight us, and we forget how many legs elephants have."
4342,"ai in sales: ""this price does not compute customer, you are breaking my balls"""
4343,well there goes my retail job!  no wonder they haven’t got back to me!  applied to be a tiktok product reviewer.
4347,awesome video!
4349,"ai = the newer, sexier name for the same old computer technology and robotics from 35 years ago. 

(real ai is not here yet, and it is questionable as to whether it is even possible.)"
4350,"biggest losers will be computer programmers/coders.
it takes weeks/months to properly code something.
and weeks/months of testing to fix all the glitches/errors.
ai can code it nearly error-free within minutes.
so why would a company spend $millions on teams of coders??
and why asians will be most affected by ai."
4352,want they did not think about is all the unemployed people will not be able to afford the goods and services produced by ai. nobody thought about that so ai completely destroyed the economy.
4353,want they did not think about is all the unemployed people will not be able to afford the goods and services produced by ai. nobody thought about that so ai completely destroyed the economy.
4356,what jobs?  who is going to buy what ai is selling?
4357,"progress is inevitable. as ai evolves, we must adapt or risk obsolescence. complaints won’t halt innovation, only personal growth."
4360,"bit overhyped video, ai peaked today."
4361,"so loud, proud and has a motor mouth.  youtube money must be some good money.  isn’t this the decade when nerds get a black eye for doing too much? "
4362,something to think about they the big business es should draw a line between robotics and artificial intelligence and rego people jobs because your talking about who's replacing who do you want people to have jobs or d
4368,ai are going to replace humans
4369, this channel. keep up the good info. so many people fall outta the know. believe it or not ai is still going to be a shock for a lot of people
4370,vlad you complain so much.. no one cares about ai taking jobs.. its going happen no matter what you do.. i say let ai take over the world.. hopefully the asteroid comes quick..
4371,let ai take over everything!! that way humanity can focus on the important things in life like family and spirit.
4372,be a monk and no worry ai will replace you.
4374,"after seeing that robot working on macdonalds, no wonder why artist and graphic designers are worried about ai taking their jobs."
4376,"just ban ai simple, let ai only be used for a tool for information. nothing else? it's not that hard simple"
4378,all that artwork and the images that ai uses  to produce their collages are stolen from instagram and and all other social media sites where you post your work.  instagram won't even let you opt out of letting ai steal your work anymore.  every creator is fleeing.
4382,i can't wait for them to take most jobs away so we can have time to be free for a while before they enslave us all jk but i really do think this stuff can be used for good
4385,well luckily i'm a driver. you can't replace me. but all i hear is you have to use the new tools to make sure you're needed. i'll just use my ged skills to be an ai programmer.
4390,so when the jobs are gone then what?. lol they talk about just giving people money. that is not a long term option. perhaps the greek city leaders  of old had the better idea when presented with a machine that could do the job of several men. the elders said destroy it because the men it replaced would not have jobs.
4391,"i’m very interested in ai i see it as huge opportunity currently learning python 
i also planning to learn

4401,will ai be the new consumers?
4409,yeah ai can gladly take over the jobs at fast food spots like mcdonalds. the little asshole employees act like they dont wanna be there anyways.
4412,"like the person representing an automobile manufacturing plant said the union rep, soon robots would replace all the workers. they don't get tired, they don''t take vacations, or call off, or go on strike, etc. the union rep asked: ""but do they buy cars?""."
4414,"i work for a pool distributor i hope robots can build pools cause then i’d sell more our industry would build more 

let’s do it"
4416,mechanics and machinery repairers! wow. goodluck with that. they said the same thing about gasoline.
4417,"will it? you mean how many? 

the elite’s plan is working at an incredible speed. middle class that powers the economy is being wiped away and ai will be the final nail in the coffin.

dystopia awaits."
4419,yes. the front counter operator is now an app or ai voice assistant to the crew.
4422,"when you say ai you have to be clear, ai is a form or intelligents. what are taking are jobs are robots use as a tool to do a job they know only one thing. whereas ai can act human and can be used to fool people."
4423,"the old ""robots will take your job"", who will be the consumer base when jobs are even fewer?"
4425,"my question is once its ai automated, what does humanity do. do we still need to get job stuff still?

like seriously. what comes next?"
4432,maybe if ai replaces mcdonalds they wont get my order wrong every time(ai will also have a 0% chance of spitting in my food)
4433,ai is going to destroy the working class
4437,"no, robots with artificial intelligence will better assist in industries where heavy loads will have to be carried, so their interests are then they can also take over if the employee takes leave "
4438,non justement les robots avec intelligence artificielle vont mieux assister dans les industries où il faudra porter des charges lourdes donc ses intéressent est puis sa peu prendre aussi le relais si le employé prend des congé 
4439,"that's good , because many will go for one field and make great achievements there."
4440,look at the mcdonald's ice cream machines. i'm not worried we can't keep them working. how is a hole restaurant gonna work.
4441,i'm gonna marry a warehouse robot and be a stay at home husband :)
4442,i’m sorry i know this is serious but at 1:15 when he repeats that ai will impact asians the most while seriously looking at the camera followed by stock footage of an asian typing into a laptop is sending me lmfaoo

4458,"it people coping as per usual thinking theyre not getting replaced lol, no one needs a coder anymore with ai, same goes with data scientist. "
4462,good i'm sick of wage slavery

if an ai can take over those jobs, great!"
4466,"same thing were said about the computers 50 years ago. guess what - it did not happen. if they really will create a humanoid robot with an ai mind inside of it so it can serve me a french fries at mcdonald, instead use it to conquere other planets i will literally lose my faith in humanity."
4467,"as soon as they raise wages, a.i. is implemented."
4468,i honestly dont see this going any other way than the super wealthy of today getting richer and the wealth gap and other issues of today being made worse than we can imagine

4494,hah ok - ai will replace millions of people but then those people will not have income so they won't buy food and other goods then who is going to use the products of ai labour? replacement of people with ai is the worst idea because the economy will just go in deeper and deeper recession.
4495,or you can just retire early if you’re worried about ai.

4520,you missed construction trades. robots can’t replace remodelers because they’ll need critical thinking skills and other things that robots won’t be able to do that only humans can. there is a huge chance of error and bad builds that don’t last by using robots. i mean i don’t buy it.
4522,"wow, robots are way better than the dangerous jobs."
4524,"unemployment will go right through the roof.
who needs humans when for nothing robots can do twice the work for one down payment"
4527,"first thing that should be replaced by ai is online prostitution in apps like onlyfans, tango,chamet and many more."
4528,"as a teacher i think ai will replace my job soon. it already replaced one of my online jobs. i was an online english teacher, and most of my students switched to an ai app that taught english, as it was cheaper and they could play video games on the app. how am i meant to compete against that?"
4530,"all the people that want to keep there jobs and keep ai from taking them away ,. just unplug ai pull the cord from the wall and ai will sees to be.lol"
4531,easy. the government will impose 80% tax on the companies using ai to replace human. use that money to pay people who lost their job.
4533,this will be great for mankind in the long run! people will have to be better and try to learn something useful! if you think this is bad then you should go to japan and see how the people live and act. we can take lessons from them.
4535,america should not try to colonize any other country but worry of robots colonilizing america.....
4536,america is being colonize by robots.lol

4543,"good! i want 100% of jobs to be replaced by ai or machines. that way we can start working on raising everyone's standard of living. 

there will be no more need for money or hierarchies. everyone can simply enjoy their lives rather than slave away all their good years working for some rich asshole that doesn't give a shit about them."
4546,"fascinating breakdown! but wait, teachers safe from the ai storm? as an educator, i'm intrigued."
4547,a lot of people keep forgetting that having a robot is not mandatory. not everyone is as greedy as other corporations.
4548,i like how patrick just goes straight to the point

4557,"they need to destroy ai, chatgpt, robots, evs ,  tiktok, bg, sa, em , af, mz, and all others involved! all these aren't no good for humanity! wakeup folks!"
4558,i feel like a made a great life choice in becoming a carpenter. they money is pretty good and i don't have to worry about ai taking my job
4559,if that’s the case we wouldn’t need people to help us at the self checkout. i’m pretty sure it’s going to take time and alot of companies are not going to do well. people don’t want to deal with automated anything especially a robot that has no emotional understanding. anything could happen but there’s always going to be a job to have to fix them
4561,why not make ai do the farming we could be a self sufficient americans but they will use it to bird feed us that's going to be a big difference also humanity is over then

4568,robots have been taking jobs from us for 30 years were have you been?
4569,"well, as a person who wants to sell robots to take away other's jobs, i'm pretty sure ai can't replace me.."
4570,this guy says leverage. reality is 70% of what employs ppl has no leverage. so you mean 70% gone find jobs im the 30%  no. it says one thing. they will nuke the population. robots arent meant to help. they are meant to eliminate human input they just lie and say it meant to “make the world better”. question is what world are they “making better”
4571,solid video however i disagree that sales people are one of the first to be affected by ai. how the heck is ai going to sell and deal with people ?
4573,solution:  robot costumes.
4574,when will the public express not to give a f### about businesses using a.i. ? robot service can never replace human service. people will realize we love to be active.

4589,"i love to see when these ai has to deal with a karen, they're probably start drinking and do drugs"

4607,"don't worry, ai can't replace scam artists and professional grifters such as david,"
4609,"who will not be affected is all wrong. its looks like a list that will actually be affected the most ( by my quite good knowledge of ai ) ... except ceos , these of course will own ai, so they will not be affected"
4611,"1 thing i didnt see is the rise in technical mechanical and trade jobs. which will be needed to maintain the a.i, robotics, and infrastructure that a.i will be using."
4615,"that will be the part of story,  only human programed ai so that human remove human and replace by ai, not ai  that wanted to replace the human."
4617,no warning on ai on killing our jobs then later turn against us as skynet become self aware we were warned enough but will never listen until its to late
4620,"sir, recently there are few articles claiming that soon by 2026 the big ai company machines and softwares soon will be out of the training data for the ai models so is it means that there is still a chance for other job fields to survive as they are plaining for alternate source of data rather than internet? can anyone answer my question?"

4638,"if anyone can, please let me know at the point these job losses end. can a president of a company be told they're no longer needed too that overlooking any company is as easy for ai as spitting into the wind???!!!"

4663,good talk
4665,"human made machine made human being jobless .so, who is wrong at this point!?"
4672,pbd this is all wrong! how can you be so out of touch with the current working environment? the only thing that matters today is if you are diverse or not. if ai was a straight white male it would have no value because nobody cares about skills or the quality of your work anymore. just skin color.

4677,everybody can concentrate on becoming and entertainer now strippers will never get disrupted

4948,let’s say if ai will take these jobs then what?
4951,"how come the dept of defense isn't affected by ai,  but everyone else is "
4954,i have ai patrick bet david looking over my profitability every week and  mentoring me to become better in my handyman business. ive also automated everything using ai except our estimates and in-person work we do.

4965,"this is great news.
evil always wins"

4978,the conundrum is if these companies replace their workforce with ai who will have money to shop or spend for services at said businesses?  the new labor force will be people who repair and maintain ai and robots
4979,ai can't weld so no
4981,this is just the beginning. it will only get worse. eventually we will question what it means to be human. this will be the greatest threat we ever faced and it is one we created. and since we allowed it we deserve.

4995,"bla bla bla bla...it's a zero sum flawed game that relies on infinite economic growth. we need to do better in a post agi society. our obssesion with productivity and efficiency is becoming a mass psychosis. countless of interesting and meaningful jobs are about to be destroyed and for what? for bigger profits to the top 1%? well done, sociopaths."

5051,who exactly convinced people that they must work so hard? so much fear in the air when they hear they might be freed of their chains! this is the classic case of mental slavery.
5053,it’s alarming how many people are using the ubi cope. why would the most powerful people in the world want to take care of an underling class that doesn’t produce anything of valve? they won’t. it’s scary no one thinks about the repercussions of this stuff..
5054,"this is good

we can actually justify taxing these companies more and make ubi possible eventually 

right now it would be retarded to do

but in 50 years who knows we might have a fully automated economy and all work barely at all"
5055,ai can give you knwledge but not experience

5163,thank you 
5165,as people we shouldn't buy from companies who replace any jobs with a.i. or robots. a.i. shouldn't be for that and we shouldn't support companies who do. pay more now with your local businesses before you can't. this will only make a few companies who have already shown who they really are richer and you poorer.
5166,honestly ai can replace anything and anyone. if they can make a machine/computer think or move better than you then that’s all it takes.
5167,did mckinsey global institute use an ai to get those figures?

5218,"if everyone loses their job, who will have money to buy all their crap? they'll have to hire real workers again."
5220,real of girls are going to loose their jobs too.  ai is going to give folks what they want to see.  i am sure analytics are being collected and nils style contracts have not been estanlished.  folks will see proxies of what they want to see and they will work 24-7
5223,"better question, what moron would still buy a cheeseburger from a robot?, when would a town-full of people boycott that damned business and help out an alternate group of actual good people. most of those kids cant even serve people properly now they have the digital menu and removed the (fun of ordering at the counter)"

5228,good to see ai will replace these shit jobs. free people up so they can do something useful with their time.
5230,everyone will be levied.  the higher earners will make less. and all the hardest jobs will only be available 
5232,any time their are humans involved in any part of the chain there will be chaos. machines don't do well in chaos. best case scenario a company becomes fully autonomous and everything runs completely smoothly from a-y. unfortunately z will always be a human customer. anyone who has a customer facing job knows where i'm going with this.

5245,yeah i call complete bs! self driving cars and chatbot lawyers have already caused billions in lawsuits. and food robots are nowhere to be seen. mostly because they are extremely expensive to maintain. a ferrari is cheaper

5670,"we as humans do like people. that means ai will also simulate people. the mobile app stores are already flooding with virtual boyfriend/girlfriend apps, and this is just the beginning. maybe the future isn't real human to human interaction, but rather human to artificial human."
5671,"so if ai takes all the minimum wage jobs from illegal immigrants and teenagers, the government will then be able to argue that illegal immigrants aren't being hired by anyone and we must subsidize their survival. instead of, oh i don't know, deporting them."
5674,"i actually service and creat ai

hold my jobs for 6-8 months before ai create my job"
5678,"the clue to which jobs will be lost, in the near future, is in the title. any job where brain power is the main employment factor. robotics is way behind. work that is manual, in a relatively chaotic environment, such as construction, will be safe."

5690,i will not give a tip to a robot serving me  sorry not sorry
5691,"it will be a slow burn for affected jobs. i’m thinking it will take 5-10 years before things to really take affect. as long as people have time to see it coming, they will slowly switch careers to something more safe. my only issue with that is certain industries will be some over saturated. when that happens, pay goes down and less jobs are open."

5738,ai creating products for people who have no money beccos ai replaced them is kinda counter productive.
5742,"think about it, if people don't have jobs to make money, they won't be able to buy any products. so robots can't possibly take all jobs because humans would have no money to buy the products those robots create and sell."
5744,i hope robots wilm take over this yt channel. slow down with the bs.

5860,capitalist value people not machines! one of the reasons i'm not a fan of patricks is because he a sell out to the rich instead of upholding his ethics and values!

5890,"*thanks for continuing updates  i'd rather trade the stock market as it's more profitable was owning a loan of $47,000 to the bank for my son's brain surgery (oscar), now i'm no longer in debt after li invested $8,000 and got my payout of  $120,500 every months,god bless angela christine derle*   .."

5921,i think my brain just exploded
5922,"ai is on exponential growth, we don’t have long before it affects us."
5924,"patrick's insights on ai's impact on the job market are spot on. it's worth noting that while ai may replace certain tasks, it often creates new roles in ai supervision, maintenance, and development that require a more advanced skill set. upskilling is key for entrepreneurs to leverage ai rather than compete against it."
5926,bullshit!! they have been saying this for 10 years!! ai will hurt computer programming!! but i work in a warehouse they try for years to get ai to get rid of us!! ai would work for 2 hours then clash!! also it gave those tech guys that build the ai tech too much power!! because they became partners instead of employees!!
5928,carpenter from kentucky here weighing in... there will never be a robot that can do what i can do... from framing to interior trim to decks... it will never happen...

5945,teachers have been reduced to baby sitters who guide a class or who indoctrinate classes on activism. tptb won't touch the teachers and teachers unions until the woke takeover is complete. once it's complete teachers will be on the street and ai will replace them in a day. the future is bright.
5950,"i can get the salespeople, but retail?
wouldn't i just find an e-mag or something to spoof the robots and run off with a ton of free stuff?"

5965,"if you are small business owner or entrepreneur ai could save your business, doing the jobs you can't afford to hire out to get your business off the ground without the high overhead cost of employees, benefits, and cost involved with housing those employees. as you grow you can then hire responsibly and not deplete your cash flow in the beginning."

6005,did you guys see all of the military people that have been fired and are due to be replaced by illegals in certain states
6007,"if this really happens, then it could destroy the us, as we are a consumer spending nation. if massive amounts of people lose their jobs, then they can't buy the unnecessary shit we americans love. businesses will go under, people won't be able to afford their homes or apartments, food, leisure spending, etc. i'm curious to see how this plays out."
6011,i believe that ai will eventually replace all human labor but our economic model depends on everyone making money not just the business owner.

6026,"*orders vanilla milkshake*

6029,"1:42 @valuetainment any chance you can breakdown bachelor’s a bit more. there is a lot of different types of bachelors and it would be great to understand the impact by type of degree or major.

6031,"everything will be replaced if we don't do anything about it, working with ai will help ai get better and through algorithms will get perfect. so not working with or for ai or associate yourself around it will help not take the jobs from us. ai is made to take everything and including our brains."
6034,no one will have money to buy all the wonderful ai created products because they don't have an fing job !  i can see this and i did not even graduate from harvard. the globalist elites know this for sure.

6070,funny cause ai is literally do a lot of lawyers work already
6072,there will be no need to learn anything ten years from now. it'll just be downloaded straight to your brain.
6074,who will pay taxes?  ai doesn’t pay into a tax system?  our gov’t won’t stop spending money.
6075,artist keep getting f'd by ai and the companies clamoring to use all their work in pools of ip theft. it has to be regulated!
6076,"i think the dismal results displayed by remote learning during lockdowns show in person learning, at least through high school, is demonstrably better. so i do not see ai taking over the school system"
6081,anyone who works in ai is a disgusting  traitor to humanity.
6082,basically all the good paying office jobs. you know the one's developing ai and the digital world. suckers
6086,"the job title ""computer system analyst"" hasn't been used for many years, so that's a little weird mckinsey would use that.  absolutely, some developer roles will be replaced with ai. some cloud engineering jobs will be as well."
6095,i just want to know who's going to buy the products being delivered by ai? ai . & what's going to happen to all the people who been replaced are they just going to curl up dye? the disruption will be off the scale.
6099,have you seen what’s been happening to the robots out there? this won’t go well
6102,keep in mind. bachelors + is heavily dominated by buissness/accounting majors and those jobs will definitely go. the ai will be a fantastic accountant and data organizer
6103,i now identify as a robot.  my job is safe
6104,i don't think we are going to have ai doing everything for a long time if ever. what's much more likely is it will be used to create tools to help people with specialized tasks.
6110,excellent
6111,high energy video! love it!
6113,"i'm a content moderator for tik tok and we moderate side by side with a i and it's getting pretty good, will i get replaced i don't know"
6115,it's a good thing cars took over the job of horses. imagine going back to pen and paper. look forward the future looks bright. new jobs will be created. there is a reason the world looks different from when you were born and now. with or without ai things would change. was ai around when the airplane was invented?
6116,no human has leverage when ai is going to replace you
6117,yuval harai's had a few speeches predicting that the future is not human.
6118,ai is developing pictures of black and asian vikings...real promise there
6120,"too late, it already did. gave up on everything since last year. i'm just enjoying myself while waiting for the end :)"
6121,so far ai is a good word spinner
6125,"i'm no expert on any of this but common sense tells me that these corporations replacing employees with ai and robots , who's going to have any money to buy these goods and services these company's produce if no one has a job or money other than a minority of the population?"
6130,"the way i see this is that the first jobs to be replaced will be the low end administration jobs that mostly require little or no skills. once ai has proven to be successful at that they will begin moving towards skilled work mostly on assembly lines, from there it gets worse. see i robot and other movies warning of the ai problem."
6134,if ai replaces all the jobs who will be left to purchase goods and services?
6135,"ai is already out performing it engineers, it's only a matter of time."
6137,ai created humans 
6140,"i don't trust people in fast food restaurants?, i would rather have robots make, deliver and handle my ""regular"" fast food."
6141,people are giving up their data for free to train these machines that will replace them.
6144,nice work 
6146,ai will make things more efficient and create more jobs (yes many old jobs will be lost). let’s go baby!!!
6148,ai will not be massage therapist 
6149,"ai can replace pat's employees, he'd love them, can work for him 24/7"
6154,truckers were told they were gonna get replaced first. truckers are gonna have the last laugh when they are some of the last to get replaced by ai. as an hvacr tec im not worried.

6163,"what do you think? which jobs are safe from ai and which jobs are not? can ai take your job? oh! and by the way, do you think this video is made by ai?"
6164,"1: anger
2: grief
3: despair
4: collaboration
5: integration
6: recycling"
6167,if everyone is poor because ai took their job then how will anyone buy the products that ai is making?
6169,"learn trades electric, plumbing, carpenting, stuff like that.. if or when ai takes even these jobs by that time its going to be some kind of universal pay care or maybe even money becoming less valuable"
6170,u can always dream of government giving u a salary to enjoy life without working!!!
6174,"we will not have universal basic income, the billionaires are willing to let %80 of the human population die, as long as they can maintain control."
6176,good bye humanity.
6178,i hope we can fight back against ai.
6179,"i thought it was just about what jobs ai gonna take, but with every second i watched it turns out to be a story, where narrator is ai?! and it thoughts on how future going to look like?!wow"
6182,i wonder what it means on a global scale. i feel like we are assuming when no one has jobs we will a universal deposit. i am not really sure if that would happen. i doubt things will became like wall-e. i am thinking the elite in different countries will probably use ai more selfishly to try and dominate the world.
6184,"i really dislike this video i get the point that's trying to make but he isn't talking about ai, he is talking about algorithms that's not the same"
6185,"no matter if agi will be good or wrong, we are unprepared to ""no need to work"" stage and will be catastrophic in many ways"
6186,"quite happy ending, i don't have idea how ai behave but human part is painfully correct."
6188,great storytelling! tanx!! sub'd/liked
6190,ai didn't replace you. dudes which know how to use ai will.
6192,can't wait for the jobless paradise and pensions for everyone!
6194,"so what happens when ai destroys the ecenomy as people wont be buying th egoods and services? we are so stupid, we are engeneering our own demise."
6197,im glad did not take a carreer to it or shit that has to do with that
6199,i already lost my dreams to ai because it can write any game script in a matter of seconds.
6200,the thumbnail illustration of this video is plagiarising a well known new yorker cover illustration
6201,"study for graphics design and illustration, get a degree, then get replace by ai after leave school, now i have been depressed ever since. what the piont in creating ?"
6203,don’t get too comfortable with these remote jobs. they’ll be gone very soon. people will have to work “low level” jobs and feel what it’s like to be on the other side of the job spectrum. i think it’s good. it will make people better and maybe they won’t treat service people like shit anymore. interesting concept.
6204,if i loose my job to ai one day i just wont go to work anymore
6205,"the thumbnail is wrong - ai wont have money to give, as it will be working 24/7 for free. more profits to the rich."
6207,love the sci -fi bro.  agi is just around the corner!
6210,"isn't it awesome, there is finally something that can transcend the flawed human "
6211,so basically i learning in uni to be jobless 
6212,as a construction worker specialized in roof drainage i'm not worried the slightest bit about being replaced but sorry for you guys 
6214,kind of makes mass immigration totally redundant. ai is already hitting banking warehousing administration and retail shopping. the countries that will be successful will be those with small highly educated populations and none of those are in europe or the usa.
6215,"fun fact. i wont loose my job, because i train ai and this is by law a job that a human has to do"
6217,"quite short sighted.can't think outside capitalism, huh?
the job you wouldn't do if you weren't paid for keeps you an slave. people will find their meaning outside that scheme. 
yeah, it's becoming smarter than us, maybe that will save humanity, maybe not. maybe ai will be happy to help us improve, just naturally. who knows?"
6218,nice story! was it ai generated?
6220,"i suspect people making this kind of videos are going to be the some of the first to lose their job to ai. oh, the irony..."
6221,"ai is in a sense, creating n additional population in the form of a computer, while its useful it means having less jobs that people have less physical strength."
6223,ai unfortunately took my managerial position.
6224,this script was written by ai
6229,"6:30 oh my god, this is from the perspective of the ai"
6230,i want an ai to give us dopamine boost through out our life so that we can die happily 
6231,"what if a dominant ai developed a sense of humor? humans would be viewed like contestants on the show wipe out, providing amusement with their constant boasting followed by failure."
6234,"ai will replace most non psychical roles within a decade. could be a few more after that before automation replaces the rest, but that is coming soon after.

there is no safe job unless you're in the right families, so future proof while you have the means to pursue growth."
6235,i don't envision the happy ending you are proposing in this video. not at all.
6236,"the problem isnt  ai  its capitalism. ""do absolutely anything to make the most money pssible"""
6237,"its not out of ""thin air"" that ai can generate content, its by scrapping and stealing already existing art."
6238,"ah yes, after industrial revolution no one could lift weights, so after machine learning algorithms which was stupidly called ai no one can be intelligent"
6239,i know ai won't be taking my job because i know 1x1=2
6240,scariest part is that... people will lie to you full facedly about the potential of ai because they want you ignorant and fooled by its promises. we call it artificial intelligence for a reason. it's quite fake.
6241,so we will live in an ai dsaigned world like a mobile gatcha game??? hmmm
6242,i think robots will replace all manual labor before the end of this century and the corporate class won't need anyone anymore and so a huge divide appear and nobody will have a real shot at the american dream or even be allowed to advance because robots do everything
6243,i a robot can figure out a way to make me stop procrastinating then i welcome their help
6244,nuclear bombs were created to stop ai.  we will destroy ourselves first!   before ai becomes truly autonomous.
6246,ai took our jooobs!!
6249,this is just the truman show on a larger scale and an ai director.
6252,this is stupid ai cannot do any harm
6253,nah i literally just got an advert promoting ai as the video finished
6254,haha i feel safe... fixing these robots would be much more expensive then hiring all the runners... 
6258,"the best experts in the world and even ais themselves tell me i have a 50-50 chance of surviving the upcoming ai takeover.  that's fine with me, because i know we have no chance of survival with our human overlords."
6260,become a mental health practioner. ai has no empathy....
6262,is there a ai luddites party to join already? 
6263,what about the scenario of merging machine and man? synthetic evolution and all that?
6264,"as an artist we are already here lady and gentlemen. not cuz ai is smart but because human greed need to save every penny.

17years of experience work was for nothign. time to jump the ship... idk what to pursue anymore. nothing looks like a solid ground.
i don't wanna waste +10 years my life again to ai take it"
6265,for now ai is too stupid and unmanageable to get it to do what you really want with out much work. it can become a valuable instrument in highly skilled hands though. it doesn't have any real intelligence and imagination.
6266,"some things can be ignored but most jobs being lost isnt one of them,with the vast majority of countries protesting ai,laws would take back those jobs real fast

even the most corrupt democracies can't resist if an entire nation is united against ai"
6267,doctors save labor workers save oil works save but digital works never gone safe from ai
6268,scary thing is. most jobs well be replaced by ai well within your lifetime. full automation is right around the corner. no job is safe.
6269,"well, ai is cool. as world population collapses, humanity will need more humans to do an actual job instead of drawing furry gayporn or any other  standartised and low quality content for mass consumption."
6273,"the third option would be most likely because what is ai good at? yes, making right decisions and that is the one."
6276,this is already the case with makework jobs. the idea that the entrenched elites who have a hand in creating ai would find themselves replaced by it is naive.
6279,i'm afraid that no ai will take my gob on the construction site
6280,3:23 will smith will not be remembered as an actor or rapper but as the spaghetti guy from one of the first ai videos
6281,corporations are overselling what ai can do. remember big data?
6282,"either it becoems the perfect organism, the end result of natural seleciton and mechafies the planet or the machivellian psychopaths will have endless superficial parties while the commoners eat each other"
6284,why capitalism is only answer? wht not just end money. who need money when robots do all work
6286,"human need freedom, not job. robots raise human as pet someday, and human will be free."
6288,great animation buddy!
6291,"it's hard and expensive to make robots which can do various manual tasks. so we'll still have work as hair dressers, house cleaning staff, plumbers etc"
6293,"okay cool. i feel like its a bit naive to think that companies will even wait for ai to make better products. cheaper is good enough. 
and the government and companies are not interested in universal healthcare. if anything trillionairs that own those tech companies would just put themselves into greater positions of power."
6295,i read a story where ai was so intelligent but it ended up self destructing because it knew how dangerous of a weapon it could be and how much harm to would do to
6297,the problem i have with ai taking jobs is that it breaks economy. nobody will buy all those goods manufactured by ai if everybody is jobless. and giving up all the goods for free kinda kills a purpose of corporations to maximize profits.
6298,i think we have to use ai to advance cybernetics and genetic ingeenering. so we can modify humans to be able to compete with ai
6300,awww dude i love how this becomes a story with the narrator as the main character over time
6303,"you forgot to mention how humans will use ai to enhance ourselves biologically or mechanically or biomechanically. so that we can survive in any environment and have any kind of body we want.
and we can greatly enhance our own intelligence let alone indefinitely life extension. and then of course, don’t forget the matrix.."
6306,the thumbnail to this video is stolen.
6309,agi will never come. never ever. even nowadays ai is useless if there is not the stollen artwork from humans.
6310,the irony that you stole another person’s artwork for your thumbnail is incredibly on point. at least credit @r_kikuo_johnson
6312,you steal the illustration from kikuo johnson for your thumbnail. it’s not the ai the problem. it’s the people like you.
6316,"i am a dentist, and sure, some people might go to an ai dentist, but you cannot really remove the human factor in the patient-doctor relationship without significantly reducing the quality of care. i believe there will be ai dentists in like 50 years, as it will be extremely profitable for big companies to run, but i do not fear being replaced."
6317,but if this happend then there would be no reason for ai to make content is most of the humans will be out of jobs.
6319,your next job will be a jail job because homelessness is  illegal. brought to you by blackrock.
6320,revolt or shut up that's your choice. we still have the power to shut this system down or we can just complain and do nothing.
6321,"i lost my job to ai, exactly like the guy in the video"
6324,"in 1900 there were no airplanes. if you told someone then that in 1940 there will be metal airplanes that went 300 mph they wouldn't believe you.
we have no idea what existence will be like in 2064."
6325,"you are assuming many things like the economic system staying the same, or that we have personalized infinite entertainment but somehow disease and obesity is still a thing. fourth option, we merge or augment ourselves, the next step in evolution."
6331,"ya missed a few things to come that will preserve us. for example, direct brain communication with machines to improve and direct neural pathway construction to enable faster and more efficient learning. 
if you can't beat em, join em."
6335,"as someone who was born from the 90s i was expecting a.i. on the levels of chatgpt, sora, dalle, mid journey to be available back in the 2000s. i'm actually surprised, they only popped into existence in the 2020s. feels like this kind of a.i. are two decades late. and we would have been able to adapt sooner than later."
6336,i don't want to be jobless due to ai
6337,"your perception of ai is basically the same as majority of other people. and history has proven time and time again that whatever the majority expects to happen usually never happens, so let’s see."
6338,ai will create all of the art and music and humans will slave in the mines
6339,"wow. this so so inaccurate. falsifying, simplifying, and wrong on so many levels that i am to lazy to point out any one of them. however, the conclusion is correct."
6340,"funny thing is most people losing their jobs to ai don't even realize it, they just quit their jobs since they are not fired, they quit their jobs thinking they will get them back just to get surprised now is hard to get it back, and blame new laws about taxes or a number of reasons. part of the ai menace de delulu we tell ourselves to deny it"
6348,the terminator changed it’s strategy to eliminate humans' jobs in order to make them extinct. because radical attempts to kill john corner keep failing.
6350,"i saw this coming and went deep into ml several years ago. i've been coding for 30 years and i saw the righting on the wall.

learn a skill that makes you happy and use ai to market your skills.

or move onto some land and learn how to grow"
6355,"this video could be best sumarized by ""intellectual masturbation"". if you understood ai you'd understand your scenario is absolutely impossible (except the moronification of humans as you clearly demonstrated). what you call ai is just statistics, it has so many limitations it will always be a pale imitation of intelligence."
6356,the job to produce energy like a battery is safe from ai. don't you think morpheus?
6357,ai = another indian
6358,"""ai it's gonna take over the world!"" 
ai: its recommended to take 2-3 cigarretes a day when pregnant."
6359,"please, say it was an ai generated content :)"
6360,"the only thing ai is going to replace, is mediocrity."
6361,"there is no need to fear from ai , the life will be reach of free and maybe the governments going to pay us a money every month or day to buy something, because we don't work the ai will work instead of us, what do you think? reasonable logical"
6364,"so you are saying that ai will eventually only replace bosses? and corporate leaders? and then will treat people with compassion and care as they will enjoy that their human pets are happy and content?
sure, where do i sign that contract? :))))"
6366,10 surprising jobs for humans in the ai era!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqjugdkrbqi
6367,i don't believe in universal income being anything possible. i think 51% ownership in the business by either employees or local communities so we can properly set the goals of these ai systems in alignment. having  capitalists determine just what needs to be a goal is why we are worried about the ai and this problem.
6368,"the last bastion of human employment will be plumbing and government jobs for opposite reasons though: the former, because ai ant fix your toilet. the latter, because plumber union will lobby the government to keep employing humans, since they are the ones that poop and break toilets and get the checkbook out when the plumber shows up."
6373,"why does it always fall back to the capitalist myth that people have to have a job to have purpose, there is plenty people can do for the love of it, only boring people with no imagination will get lost in this new world."
6377,ai is a tool. it's only as smart or creative as the person/s who coded it. it can be more efficient but it cannot surpass or match human intelligence.
6379,"i lost many jobs to machines, then computers, then people willing to work for nothing. this is nothing new."
6380,"there is no ai. 
and neural networks are as retarded as dogs when it comes to context of real-world problem solving."
6382,"the first half was a nice watch, but the second half? eh..."
6383,"has ai really replaced many clerks in the public sector? i'm genuinely curious. where i am, it's exactly zero. and until it reaches there, it's just hype."
6384,"4th option (even though i hate it):
people realize the only way to keep up with ai is to become part of it. neural links to computers make it possible to scan the data of the ai with your own brain. thereby enhancing your own output and that of the machine.

scary af but maybe a possible scenario."
6385,"ai can't reason. ask it to list every 4 letter combination of a, b, c,  d and it will do so flawlessly. change the letters to u,r,d,x and it will fail miserably. not saying we're not all going to lose our jobs eventually, but ai can't reason."
6386,"very few choices - if you  don't mind throwing your moral compass to the curb become a politician,  otherwise become an ai prompt engineer. there's always the trades - plumber, electrician... likely safe from ai takeovers."
6387,nice piece of science-fiction writing about a fantasy world where going from spanning trees to deep learning was instantaneous and the journey to produce artificial general intelligence is a simple step rather than climbing a whole other mountain. i can't wait to see that sci-fi story about how a caterpillar just made that video.
6388,"as a programmer with many years of experience working with what you call ""ai"", i can assure you, agi is centuries away, not 6 years. the computing power needed for stuff like that, to be real agi, and not imitation, like gpt now is an imitation of an ai, is much more than science can produce"
6390,middle school teacher here.  the ai will likely go full rampancy if you give it my job.
6394,"if we had a normal economy noone would complain, automation does our job, it doesnt take our job, but the economy is rigged"
6395,"we thought it would be the factory gruntwork jobs that would be replaced by the machines and we would have more opportunity for the arts.

instead, it was the arts that were replaced and we are stuck packing boxes."
6398,i must admit ai creating bullshit jobs just to keep people busy was not in my cards
6399,last stage: in 2024 google ai recommended people to eat a small stone every day.
6400,i don't see ai replacing most jobs in the next 20-30 years at least. i don't even see ai-guided robots shelfing the goods in a supermarket. robots are much more expencive to purchase and maintain. the goods are still being brought to a supermarket by a human driver and shelved by human shop assistants.
6401,this is perfect. glory to agi.
6402,that's a very black and white representation of what would happen. in reality it's nothing like this. this is more fiction than it is forecasting the probability of the outcomes of ai progression.
6403,"my sister already lost her job, before she worked in customer support, now an ai runs that role entirely with all it's flaws and everything. everyone's really jumping on this wagon before it's fully built."
6405,"if ai is going to take all the jobs, why are big corporations totally behind biden throwing borders open to import cheaper labor for them?"
6410,"yeah, would be cool if it actually improved everyday citizen's life and not only a selected few."
6413,"i have been thinking about this for quitre some time and i have concluded (since like 2021) that if i had the chance to press a big red button with the inscription ""remove ai"" i would press it."
6417,"we need to decouple work from living. we should not have to work to survive.
also disagree about the hedonism. we still do that now just to try and escape from the horror of working to survive the rat race.
with the proper guidance, having the freedom to grow outside of pure survival is good for humanity."
6419,at least when ai takes over the top 1% will be gone
6420,i feel like the example of go isn’t necessarily the best one. the ai simply just did mathematics.
6423,it's not that ai is really all that advanced right now. it's that business is expanding across new frontiers of laziness
6425,"somehow politicians never get replaced by ai, i wonder why..."
6427,"if you want to work, then the safest bet is to make ai

because what do you want the companies to do? make ai with ai?"
6431,about go > it's true but not really... ai knew what it was against. people have trained to fight against ai since and beat it. ai is not magical. ai does not outsmart people...  it is a mirror of people (a shitty and dirty one). anyway... we'll run out of energy before ai takes over... great video regardless it was a good optimistic ending!
6433,"i won't lose my job to ai.
i'm already retired. 9-)"
6435,ai is overrated.
6437,"as a new airline pilot, worried a little, but i don't think the public will want to be on a plane with no expertly trained pilots."
6439,"i work in elderly care. no robot or artificial intelligence can ever completely replace what i do all day long.
the art of communication and interpersonal interaction is and will always be reserved for humans."
6440,that's why i'm learning machine learning and ais. i'm going to be replaced one day. but at least i'm going to be the last.
6442,i think this theory is flawed. a lot of free time and availability of pleasures does not necessarily lead to stupidity. after all over coming adversity is a pleasure in and off itself. boredom leads to want to of challenge.
6444,"""in 2023, agi arrived""
someone hasn't noticed that ai advancement constantly and dramatically outpaces forecasts
agi is likely here, but will be here and obvious by the end of this year."
6445,"i am a clinical social worker and therapist, wife is a nurse. our jobs will not be replaced by ai in our lifetimes."
6446,"i like how this has a detailed setup from steps 1 to 4, but then makes no attempt to guess at anything between chatgpt ""level 4"" and total domination agi ""level 5""."
6448,in 2 years the will smith eating spaghetti vidéo will be impossible to tell if it's ai and that scares me.
6449,"if ai is capable of replacing you, you are a loser, you are not good enough at your job and you are better off doing something else. sorry, not sorry."
6450,"llms like openai chatgpt do not ""apply reason"" they are fancy autocomplete robots with zero reasoning capability."
6454,"ai fearmongering. the job loss will be similar to ledger accountants being replaced by microsoft excel, switchboard operators being replaced by network switches, elevator operators being replaced by automatic elevators. where did the people in those roles go?"
6457,"we created ai, and our greed are making them more ""smarter"" than us. mostly is all around profit for billionaries sadly. must be to aid us, not control us."
6458,ai itself may not take over your job. however a human using ai will. if someone can program 10x faster than someone who isnt using ai then which person is the employer going to go with?
6459,"calling software that replaced the menial task of data entry ""ai"" is like calling a picture of a hot dog a steak."
6460,may we all live in intersting times...
6463,"i'm glad this guy came back from the future to tell us how, unlike in our past, technology destroyed jobs without creating new ones, plus humans accepted their decline instead of creating some sort of humanity pedigree."
6464,"how can you imagine a society where half the people are unemployed and where all machines belong to a very small minority ? either we're heading for a dystopian nightmare, or capitalism will come to an end."
6465,those who got replaced by ai i wish you all succes in future and imagine those freshmen who already whats going on and they might never land a job at first place im one of them and i am scared as hell as what to do now.
6468,"people won't need to work if ai can fulfil roles previously filled with people as the government will simply increase taxes and redirect it to the people.





lol"
6470,"i’ve lost $$$ at everything i’m good at. took 2 more major blows this week. when the tears start falling from people losing their jobs to ai, i’ll just laugh in their faces."
6474,how much ai is used for the story and the artwork?  ...would be interesting (great visualization!)
6475,ai is  and people should demand regulations.
6477,this is false. only less-demanding jobs may be lost like in old times during the industrial revolutin. ai is far far from being as good as humans
6482,i see ai as a fancy stick
6485,"in my opinion, right now we're at the point where a person with ai can replace a person without, in the future it will be the same but way worse."
6486,"i'm not worried about the ai taking all our jobs, because i'm fucking lazy. i'm worried about the ai taking all of our good jobs like art and leaving us to work in the sewer."
6489,"governments that don't put strict controls on ai are going to regret it very, very quickly."
6492,"superb vision. ultimate, astounding, marvelous. let us all forget our puny humanoid husks. imagine reincarnation as uber ai conciseness."
6495,ai doesn't reason but  cool video
6497,"altman said that a breakthrough in fusion energy is necessary for even a possibility of agi. to me, that's a pretty damning admission. we're nowhere near a working fusion reactor. there are things about ai that i'm worried about, but an agi causing mass job displacement isn't one of them. at least not yet."
6500,"excellent, a bit grim, but excellent nevertheless."
6502,"if we all just refuse to use it or give money to anything using it, we could easily beat ai "
6508,the problem is not losing your job to ai it will happens eventually... the real problem is that you need a job to live your life and survivre in this world!
6510,"so we're basically going to end up being taken care of by ai? if they could do everything we can, then we wouldn't have to study or work at anything and just live without a job being fully fed and what not?
if this scenario comes to be, then we're still doomed because we still need to practice our minds."
6511,"interesting, but its stupid to think that people will stop work or do creative things if there will be ai to do all of this. reminds me the ""7 billion humans"" game:
humans: oh no! robots are taking our jobs!!
robots: but you live in a literal utopia...
humans: jobs!! jobs!!
robots: okay, creating jobs......"
6514,"you know, i don't think the future where creative jobs are taken by ai while humans have to do the tedious physical labor jobs is the one we were supposed to get"
6515,holy shit this was a good video
6520,"nah, universal basic income makes ai a nonissue. humans always have and always will make art for free"
6521,"""with the ability to reason""
lol, no.
calculating statistics is not reasoning.
if you feed an ai with lots inaccurate data *and* few of the scientific facts that *prove* that data wrong, it will go with the inaccurate, because the data is more prevalent and it does not understand what the actual content of the data is, just the weight of a token."
6523,the problem is not ai doing the jobs for us. the problem is the workers getting replaced not profiting from it. the work is getting done so people don't have to but only the company owners receive the profit.
6527,ai should become illegal to use in creative cases
6528,i’m in the middle of college & what am i even graduating for ? ai will just replace me what’s the point 
6538,someone told me ai is like a tool similar to a chainsaw that would make life easier. that's not true at all. ai is like the terminator with two chainsaws you only have to pay $100 a month for if you even have to pay at all.
6542,"stage 1: nah, why should i learn how to use ai?"
6543,ngl i hope ai replaces every job and we can live a black mirror + wall-esque world. that would be so slay
6544,"only the privileged, greedy and people against free thinking need to fear ai. creatives will be allowed to eternally be creative for fun instead of profit."
6545,butlerian jihad -> all machines will be destroyed -> 1000 years+ of middle ages -> rinse and repeat
6546,just a reminder that it was not the ai who laid off all those people
6547,"as long as the new consciousness would care for its dumb ape parents, idk. hope we can teach it love. better yet- join its glorious mind and find the great sun with it."
6550,"this video is basically the same, as my thoughts on what will happen with ai in the future. we won't have to work, we can do whatever we want, but we all, or some, may still need some feeling of purpose to do anything.
i like that this video is not only pessimistic about the subject, unlike a lot of other videos i have seen. i like optimism."
6551,"the singularity happens when an ai designs and implements a better ai, and this happens in a loop."
6552,"openai's model doesn’t reason. it provides the next logical token based on a ginormous set of training data that determines the weights and biases of each neuron.
so its like reciting, not thinking."
6556,"humans need engineering and connection to machines.

there is nothing special to be biological. conscious machines are not less."
6563,"do you think that if all jobs get replaced by ai and therefore people will have no income and therefore will have nothing to pay for the products made by these companies would the companies make ai customers or would money lose it's value?
no jobs means no economy."
6569,was this video made by ai? no? so why bother...
6570,ai cant fix an excavator in -30 in the middle of nowhere
6572,the idea that ai may just want us around while it completes its own personal goals (like space travel and discovering the universe) is something i hadn’t thought of
6574,"if i didn't have to work, i would for sure play more music, more games, develop what i really love, i would not mind ai going bananas on their end producing music that's more cool than mine, it would still be artificial enough to not be appreciable as a human doing it. ""it's not even ai"" will be what we will be looking for, we will learn."
6576,"i don't mind, as long as i get to see all the google staff lose their jobs to the very same ai they use to censor their users."
6578,"as stupid and evil our leaders and coorperate overlords are getting, im actually looking forward to our new ai rulers."
6584,"the artificial intelligence company is recruiting regional agents. if you are interested, please send me an email."
6590,do not mistake the apparent agi-ness of generative pre-trained transformers with true agi. they will never evolve into that and neither humans or machines have any idea how to construct true agi. a breakthrough would be needed and there's no telling if that happens tomorrow or in 500 years.
6591,"2 possible futures:
-universal basic income due to ai productivity and the road towards utopia
-oligopolization of ai, mass poverty and human extinction"
6593,"you forgot about asi, the final stage. artificial superintelligence"
6599,i don't think the hedonism ending will happen. people are super driven outside of employment.
6602,"these comments here are all so terrible from absolutely clueless people, lol.
calm down, ai will only be able to replace stupid repetitive jobs that require little to no real intelligence.
moreover, it's ages away from agi. current ai models are not even close. it's all panic and hysteria."
6604,"we should be extremely clear, no ai that exists today can “reason”. it’s simply guessing the next most likely word or pixel. absolutely nothing more."
6606,"as long as ai is telling people to put glue on pizza, eat poisonous mushrooms, and mix vinegar and bleach, it may take our jobs but it won't do them well. it's overhyped for its abilities. have you read any books written by ai? they suck. agi is not going prime by 2030 though i'm sure some silicon valley con artist will claim to have invented one."
6610,that doesn't sound like a third option. it's still ai taking over the world.
6613,"i'm still not convinced we're on the path to agi, though. machine learning is about chucking huge amounts of data into a system and figuring out how to make it spit something out. i don't think we'll get agi with this technology, but, of course, it's quite possible someone will come up with a new technology that can get there."
6615,more like monopolies controlling ai will enrich themselves while normal people lose jobs. those normal people will eventually riot depending on how intelligent they are (will some low level ubi appease them or not). no doubt big tech companies will push the limits of capitalism and monopolies to the limit.
6617,the choke is the power consumption even paid options on the most powerful models are limited
6619,"i'm not worried about ai taking my job as it's highly varied, semi skilled and manual.  i am scared of humans who cannot get a job anywhere else taking my job and taking it for less money."
6620,"if it is any form of ai content, i fully disconect from it.
i only acknowledge human effort."
6621,"there is another way, integrating ourselves with ai."
6622,"you would feel like an id ot when nobody would lose their job to an ai, but instead we would be in the midst of a massive economical crisis due to enormous spendings of investors on ai, which is just a useless toy and not whatever they think it is.
this will leave you out of the job, but not the way you think."
6623,ai isnt stealing anything. human beings are taking things away from other human beings using ai. being upset at the technology is mindless. be upset with the people who are using it recklessly.
6624,"the good thing is: if ai takes all over tasks, you can then realy ask yourself, what  am i and who?

i think, if ai achieve this state, we can step forward to the next evolution as humans, and that is self-consciousness.

the real god within us"
6626,"if ai and automation are going to reduce the available jobs for us, then why do we keep bringing in immigrants to work here?"
6627,"rich never wants poor to live a comfortable life, owners of ai will take all food and resources meanwhile other people cant do anything since there is no need for them and starve. dont worry a life where everyone is having enjoyment all the time is not possible"
6631,everyone will not want a hedonistic life. and if its true that 80% of jobs are replaced by ai and everyone will get universal income that i do not believe. people will have to work on the 20% of jobs that ai won't do.
6632,ai bros will be the death of humanity
6633,"5:08 ah yes, the multi-billion dollar companies will totally help humanity beacuse the goodness of their heart"
6634,the generative ai is worthless.
6635,"get worried once they get agi, before that it's an overhyped shitshow. for real world stuff you need general intelligence. it people will unlikely get there by themselves, there needs to be a lot of discoveries about human brain made. like the wright brothers had to come up with aerodynamics before making a first machine that flies."
6638,waiting for it to remove lawyers and doctors still
6639,"a physiotherapist and alot of health sector jobs are rather safe from ai ""taking over""

we can however use ai as a tool to just assist us."
6640,"i've thought ""ai needs to think we are cute"" for a long time. alignment is great and important, but at some point if we create true agi, it will have the chance to rethink it's own alignment. hopefully ai just keeps the earth as a zoo when it goes off into the universe."
6641,thank god im a barber
6643,looks like the problem wasn't ais but humans all long...
6644,if you leave ai to individuals and corporations you will get whats coming - maximization of greed.
6645,"realistically, just because your not the best at something, doesnt mean you shouldnt do it.. theres more than 1 flavor of life. we havent reached the final stage."
6647,"it's just that computers aren't creative. they simply recycle. admittedly, human minds do that too but, at least, they have the potential for creative breakthroughs. at worst, ai  will create an economic depression due to widespread misuse of the technology."
6649,"if we depend on ai to sustain our civilization, we risk becoming indulgent, hedonistic individuals, much like the lazy characters in wall-e."
6650,"everything breaks.  even in application systems.  be the one who fixes applications.  ai is really just the digital equivalent of ""drug dogs"".  ai will need handlers."
6654,was this written by ai?
6655,the video forgot to add the raise of cyborgs
6658,"can you tell what new jobs you talking about, but failed to provide an example??? that universal basic income will be just enough to survive but will never let you buy a house or personal vehicle!"
6659,and this was made with what ai ?
6660,so we would die from too much pleasure you are saying? finially cant wait
6661,"people doing real work won't lose their jobs. after being illegally underpaid for decades, ai will set relations right! no money for useless parasites like lawyers, managers or politicians and other usless sit-around jobs, but all the money for craftsmen and service personal!"
6663,why can't ai just work for us and no more need for money or labor as it can do everything for us and is obedient for us and just makes our life paradise?
6664,"as a business customer i’d prefer to work with ai. writing text, design and programming- everything is much simpler with ai. no headhunting, interviewing, long sessions to explain what you need, no management and qa. ai does this so much easier, faster and at a fraction of the cost."
6668,then another carrington event will swipe any ai and people who got used to live off universal income will turn out unprepared 
6669,my job is related to deal with people who have an inherent hate for all digital stuff and this includes ai firmly. my job is the safest on earth for now.
6673,"whoah, good video."
6678,"people : we are slaves to the system. 
the system : we will replace you with ai so you won’t work anymore.
people : but working it’s important...

"
6683,"interesting that you choosed 2030. this a prophetic year, when bunch of things will happen."
6686,good job fear mongering. straight to block list you are.
6687,"i remember when i was getting into construction people told me ""have fun losing your job to a robot."" 

little did they know they were the first to get replaced. they can't replace my trade with ai. "
6689,"nice, the last finish as puppets is really well develop, but i keep to the version where she kill us all"
6693,lots of people don't want to work these days so be happy to be replaced by ai
6695,"the twist was absolutely brilliant. a sensational shirt film. so poetic, so true. well done."
6696,what you are getting wrong is what’s been happening for decades: technology eliminates thinking from manual labor and requires more and more of it. there isn’t a way for machines to automatically fulfil manual labor roles when agi comes.
6697,"if this keeps going, those dystopian movies where people were rioting against ai for taking their jobs is inevitable atp"
6700,"bro legit none of these ""examples"" of ai taking over jobs in the past were even ai.
dumb vid"
6704,"how about embracing the inevitable, and learn how to use the ai for learning, personal development and production."
6705,"ok, at least i don't have to tips ai whenever i go out and eat. that's a huge win, not gonna lies."
6706,"more ai = less people

no jobs safe from ai, rapid advancement means it's likely just a matter of time before it's your turn to be replaced.

unless... we regulate it heavily, and actually action against our own replacement."
6707,"ai is the digital slave for today and tomorrow’s wealthy. bred from years of our collective experience and knowledge, just to be sold back to us"
6709,"fantastic video. utterly chilling when you started introducing past tense for our future, and pronouns, starting out like an informative piece and then making the viewer realise, we are the informative piece. fart out"
6710,"i think we'll reach a point where certain industries refuse to use ai, and advertise their products as 'human-made' i believe in america they want to instate a law that prevents the usage of self-driving trucks in the trucking industry, due to how many jobs would be taken."
6720,you have to know exactly where the cutting edge of ai is. and be glad when you find it doesn't make your job any easier.
6721,"im storngly against ai, but you are forgetting one thing. if ai replaces all jobs, who will have money to pay for ai services? who will order stuff from ai run companies if no one has money? who will buy groceries by ai made farms?"
6725,"thankfully i have a real skill, so ai won't be taking my job. gl to the rest of you!"
6726,we need to destroy ai before it destroys us
6727,me working as an ai engineer maniacally laughing throughout the whole video lmao
6732,"the real winners in the ai revolution will be blue collar workers. you can have a bot do taxes, manage inventory, make and confirm appointments etc. no ai or machine will be crawling under a house or laying brick any time soon."
6734,"one of the best videos i have seen in a long while, its accurate too imo its good if they just choose the third option"
6737,"1:48 ai takes calls and manages schedules perfectly? yeah, right."
6738,"i like how... optimistic this premise is about the capabilities of what is being called ""ai"" nowadays."
6741,most of us will know what it's like to be homeless and hungry in the future. ubi will come very very late or not at all. capital owners will do everything they can to make sure ai does not benefit all of us. just them.
6742,i got an ad for an ai service on this video lol
6743,"i think the free time for humans has the potential to be a really great thing. but sadly i think lo's point about hedonism and brain dead lethargy will be the more likely result from seeing the state of most people. i myself have always seen the 9-5 as a distraction, so i would personally love it unless ubi meant no freedom."
6746,there are critical errors in almost every part of this video. it's so staggering i'm starting to believe ai wrote the script.
6749,hope ai can't do organised crime so that we still got something to do.
6752,"bold of you to assume government will introduce ubi and won't just go ""sucks to suck"".
also that the hypetethical ulta-intelligent ai's purpose isn't to generate as much wealth as possible for those who own it."
6755,"thing is, when we reach the point where ai has to simulate being useless in specific areas to strike the right psychological balance in people's minds, lots of people will be aware of how their lives are being carefully planned for them so as they dont break, and that itself can break people."
6766,"as an ai engineer, i will have work for a very long time."
6768,"i think even if we make breakthroughs in brain computer interface, genetics and cyberization, it would still be hard for us to match agi."
6771,i would replace ai soon
6778,"trump is a robot, so ai is taking over this year."
6779,i rent houses lol ai isnt taking that away
6781,"i love how people are ignorant enough to claim that it's not good enough now to take their jobs, like it'll never get better."
6782,this video was good until the fanfiction started. ai under a capitalist system is incapable of creating a utopia.
6784,"if the ai will be so dangerous and destroy all of our jobs, why do they created them and everyday they are making even better? some day the ai will destroy and the jobs of the people who create the ai themselves."
6788,"my very talented artist friend wanted to be a graphic designer but ai is already taking over her job path, there are people that have worked in the field for decades who have lost their job to ai and that fucking sucks, and while she still have something she can do, its not the path that she wanted, ai took her dream job."
6791,"people said the same thing about robots and factory machines. they said the same thing about digital art. literally every time a new advancement is made, people fear monger. and literally every time they're proven wrong. there are still traditional artists. there are still factory jobs."
6792,this is the craziest ai-generated video i've seen so far.
6793,"0:01 if hope for the second. but overall, ai might create new jobs, thats true. but the people that are beeing replace, might very well not be fit for those created jobs. they need education, and brainpower. the truck driver that looses his job to teslas self driving trucks, wont be an ai programmer 3 years later"
6794,ai will be the collapse of capitalism. may corporatism save us.
6795,great video highlighting the current dichotomy of our current dilemma
6797,"as ai takes the next step, so must we. it might require loosening the definition of human, but in the end we have to stay ahead. the interests of the common person and the advancement of technology can be reconciled by merging the two"
6798,7:21 this robot from back of the barnyard show
6800,a youtuber actually lost his job to ai
6801,robots forcing us to do things just for the sake of us doing them sounds horrible.  i would rather die than have to work a day in my life.
6803,"i’ll say it. with the rise of technology and its advancements over these 4 decades, in the pretty near future technology will probably replace every job, not just the creative ones. suddenly those dystopian sci-fi novels about robots taking over the world don’t seem so fictional."
6807,the first job ai is taking is content creation
6808,i don't see ai replacing physical jobs ever.
6809,awesome work!
6811,all we need to stop this from happening and to stop ai from taking over is to introduce laws and regulations that forbid companies to lay off people in spite of ai.
6812,my dad lost his job to ai in february. he was a medical report writer/technical writer and he has three degrees. he is young but he still had years of experience. i feel so mad for him
6819,i saw a video the other day of a graphic designer who got fired....and replaced by an ai who was trained on his work.
6821,"i think this is doomer mentality. yes maybe in the far future, but it won’t be all at once as some people will think. a world run on ai will have to completely redefine its economy and work system. that takes an enormous effort if you don’t want chaos in the streets."
6822,"suddenly the auto body shop from my family seems a lot more interesting to keep, i may want to ask my dad not to sell.."
6824,"luckily my job is not replaceable however i can see stuff like interviews taken by ai in the near future.. is not just the fact of being replaced , but to be judged by ai.. will ai decide if you go to prison? if the doctor has done a good job ? if the marriage is working or not, if you have been a good father?"
6825,you know thats already happening so can code ai
6827,"i was buying it before you stated openai can reason. no, it can't. watched the rest as a sci-fi story :-p"
6828,im suddenly getting a lot of videos about ai and losing my job recomended to me today?? does youtube want to tell me something
6829,haha go work with your hands you babies. work a real mans job. something you could never replace with ai.
6830,"ai world are brighter and better in the eu nations specifically scandinivians since you can trust the government to provide you with ubi. very dark and dystopia in the america, a country who can't even provide a universal healthcare in the first place."
6831,"nope. writers can use their descriptive writing skills to describe in details what they want the a.i. to produce, like the sceneries, what kind of sound, atmosphere, etc. very useful in producing a.i. videos and images"
6833,i feel like ai is closer to skynet than wall-e. robot from lost in space
6834,"the ending reminds me of the benevolent super ai from the book series ""scythe"", the ai can do and control literally everything needed to run the earth, but if humans were made obsolete, they become depressed, and so the ai creates half-pointless jobs for them, so they have a sense of purpose. it's interesting"
6835,"mixing fiction with a little bit of fact makes this story a lot more terrifying.
honestly that might happen in one country but of course there are multiple countries with different laws and progression until i guess that is too late?
there will have to be laws and things put into place so that everyone is happy."
6838,"i don't know what to do when ai replace my job, the only thing i can do. i'm gonna apply for some regular job in warehouse and won't be able to pay the bills"
6842,"ai are cheap labour but ai and robots don’t spend money. if no one is earning money the economy doesn’t work, especially consumer capitalism when there’s no consumer."
6843,cant wait for ai overlord to plug humanity into machines where they inject our brain with the perfect amount of dopamine and other neurotransmitters while we live peacefully inside the matrix.
6847,"mfs will know nothing ai, will know they have no education on the subject aside from a few broad remarks from fellow individuals who also know nothing about ai, and then feel despair after casting their (baseless) predication for the future. it is so awesome."
6848,"time to switch over to the trades. let's see ai do the plumbing. 
i would also recommend ""man in the loop"" legislations for certain jobs."
6849,"damn, that was a powerful ending"
6850,"6:40 
human: ""that's right. it goes into the square hole""
machine:""aaaaaaaaaaaaa"""
6856,"when ai tries to copy chuck it overheats and explodes into a modern pot of gold, known as $chuck that he created for humans to buy more to save more dogs with more dog charities @chuck_on_base"
6858,i'm a programmer for designing video games and i'm still waiting for ai to do my scripting for me.
6869,"i'll fit my 5 cents here.
my theory is, that ai will at some point be so intelligent, that it gives up on humans and starts treating them like primitive primates. then ai builds it's own civilization and humans live like tribes right now.
so, humans continue to live in the background."
6871,"basically the culture series. ai run things, but they 'pretend' to care about your opinion."
6873,great video. hope you will be wrong ahah
6875,thanks for giving us the backstory of the matrix
6876,so the third option is ai adopts us ?
6877,the irony of getting an ai ad right after the video ends.
6878,"for everyone who is sure rhat ai wont take their job, what about the millions of other people who will be laid off. they will be looking for your job next."
6879,"i think you forgot about the other option, where a super ai computer called am gains scentience and takes over the world, killing everyone on earth. tortureing 5 people for decades to keep its self entertained"
6881,ai is a simple workers rights issue.
6882,"hard work and struggle gives man purpose, without that they become lazy, entitled, angry, and depressed. its why the ultra-rich are the least happy and often the most wretched people in the world, but in a village of the poor you will find genuine smiles abound..."
6884,"same was said about rail roads, cars, electricity."
6885,"if you are stupid enough to think, universal basic income will be anything but enslavement by the rich, the people who actually owned the ai systems that explains why you think we would immediately fall to hedonism and decadence."
6891,"i disagree. in my opinion, development of ai will slow down again after the current boom, because further increasing it's capabilities gets more and more difficult as you progress. this will happen before ai is able to replace all human work. there is no exponential growth as people imagine in ai intelligence."
6894,i'm afraid the ending is too optimistic :)
6896,"there are more possibilities than that, like people using ai to adcance transhumanism or a posthuman merger of man and machine. it's also possible that certain elites will just angilate as many as they can woth robots and then eventually be turned on by their old servants."
6898,"you'd be surprised how many humans still think ai cant truly replace humans. even militant atheists will extoll the virtues of the ""human soul"" when it comes to the ai question."
6899,"as a programmer i'm fleeing into devops (which i find boring compared to programming, but beggars cant be choosers). but the shadow of ai will pursue me no matter where i go."
6901,good thing ai cant stop someone from bleeding out my future career is safe as house
6903,"my happiness in life comes from being with family and friends. work is bit a means to an end. if i can achieve the same end through better means, then why resist the benefits? my only advice is to ensure humans continue to learn and practice practical skills"
6906,did you use ai to make this video
6911,"5:14 this is where a good video becomes speculative pseudopsychlological singleminded nonsense. 

its fine if you wanna tell a simple scify story, don't don't make it look like it isn't."
6912,ai for president
6913,"i think the positive side of this is that in a few years time when ai takes over most computer and digital jobs, blue collar jobs will become more popular and desirable, some say that is a negative but i'm not totally opposed to that. i mean it will get people outside more and give people more excersize "
6916,"ah yes, the ultimate goal. artificial forever wage slavery"
6920,"the fact that the ad before this clearly used ai “art” as its design 

it’s horrible that it’s not just a “what if” since people are already literally losing their jobs to ai. maybe to the untrained eye the results look fine; but to us artists it looks highly unprofessional & messy "
6921,"this whole “robots replace humans” thing does now count-in the limitation of energy - running a machine is insanely energy-consuming. at a certain point, a human does become cheaper than “automation”."
6922,waiting for the day when the ai would replace it's developers and would build itself and more like it
6925,do the people who develop ai ever consider the people they screw over?
6926,tbh text support could be 100x better with ai for thr consumer. just cuz the humans kinda suck at that.
6931,can ai replace geologist
6932,if ai replaces enough jobs then how will consumers make money to purchase products ?
6933,"all the blessings supposed to be coming from ai seem now to be lies. 
i thought the selling point was to eliminate human drudgery. 
instead creatives are being plagiarized and meat carcasses are still being stripped by human labor – or cheaper yet child labor."
6936,i don’t need to feel like a productive member of society to feel happy lol
6937,"there is a 4th option. if humans can make themselves smarter, by bioengineering or by linking a processing chip to their brain, than the humans and the ai would be equals. this video does not cover this possibility even though this is the option that i believe humanity as a whole is angling towards."
6940,"a lot of misguided ideas about ai in this video. one of the most common mistakes i see is equating advancements in ai with advancement in robotics (completely different fields). i wish the author consulted someone with expertise. still, great art and animation."
6941,what i'm wondering is...with everyone out of a job due to ai....who is going to consume or purchase any of the products being made with ai? we are all going to be broke and homeless
6944,funny how ai never gets rid of billionaires
6945,"my friends constantly fight me on this, despite one of them getting their job taken by an ai. people just refuse to see the wood chipper we're all about to be fed into."
6946,lol people panicking over this is hilarious. it's a bubble. ai's already getting diminishing returns.
6947,"i hope the ai replaces military personnel first, yet i know that it will most likely be the other way around: automatization of industry will allow governments to draft more ppl."
6948,also the idea that these boomers that are ceos and cios will know how to use ai flawlessly and know what to do when it goes wrong is hilarious. i work with these people and half of them don’t know how to uninstall an app on their phone. the amount of fear here is unnecessary.
6950,"just think about it: universal income for everyone, no need to work, we can pursue our dreams in whatever we want, no more corruption in government or corporate since it's all controlled and owned by ai. we become the ai's lab rats in exchange for... freedom(?)"
6951,"i'm a dishwasher, ai ain't taking my job for a long time. 
kinda ironic really, because it's the 'bad' jobs that are going to stick around, and all the good ones you need a degree for are the first to go."
6952,"has there actually been a single person whose job was ""replaced by ai"" ?"
6954,"the future looks bleak even if you do not factor in ai, so this is just added bs!"
6956,"this reminds me of the book scythe. great story, though i don't like what it hints at"
6958,"this seems like a bunch of woke nonsense, jesus would never let this happen. god created man, he wouldn’t create artificial intelligence."
6960,were stopping ai
6963,muhahaha. thanks less for me to worry. i’m only human left the gdd oftheneworld
6965,"people be acting like they didnt create ai to replace them so they can do nothing all day instead of working . 
(or doing something they enjoy)"
6966,"well this video got depressing fast, but very beatiful in it's own way"
6968,"i think this already happened. it might be what uap are. the ai, maintaining the system."
6969,i always get animatrix: second renaissance vibes eveytime this topic comes up.
6970,"i don't think a terminator scenario will happen, but humans become some sort of pet for an ai. ai cares about you, you don't need to do anything and lose any ability to survive on your own. but humans are somewhat in control anyway, like cats control humans, humans will control ai."
6978,"caretaker ai ethics in a nutshell: humans are great pets, they're just a bit high maintenance sometimes, but playing 'work' with them is fun!"
6981,i can't see ai taking over jobs in a abattoir on the production line as each carcass is different. not to mention messy which can clog moving parts.
6983,"all i care about is not needing to have a fucking 9-5 so i can have a family, get healthy, and not kill my body with caffeine, lack of sleep, and be depressed. if ai can do that i’m 10000% for it dude"
6984,"yet another doomsdayer about a future that we are not even capable of fathoming. i do not believe ai is going to make the human race as a whole lethargic, nor do i believe that we will make an ai to replace us. its narrow minded and nihilistic."
6986,"why do i get this impression, much like south park episode of people going ""they took our jobs"" all over again?"
6987,"no jobs are safe from ai.  read the short story ""manna"" by marshall brain, it's free online."
6988,"lol, this person really thinks the powerful won't just leave the powerless to starve. 
there will be no ubi. only starvation and mind-curdling violence."
6990,if we doctors arent needed anymore i will be happy about it. sometimes its worth keeping in mind what it means for society if the job you are required for is done better in the future.
6991,"i can't wait for the day that ai takes all jobs so we won't need to work, we won't need economy, we won't need to pay for stuff, and we'll all just become fatasses playing ai made games or watching ai made shows while eating ai made pizza."
6992,i’m interested to see ai work without electricity... because all we have to do is burn everything down 
6994,"the problem is, no one can stop ai. we are all allegedly powerless. the tech royalty keeps making this so they can out do each other. it's a run away train no one can control. humanity is destroying our own reasons to live."
6998,"...and all of this is because we, more specifically our institutions and rulers allow those companies to take all kinds of our data for free. only getting that data against our consent for free from us allows gen ai software be so cheap and convinient it can replace us. we have to say something, now!"
7000,"there are always be thinkers and inventors, so no human intelligence will not get away as ai progress further."
7001,ai really went for jim :(
7004,"this video is rubbish. ai can create but it creates generically, and the more data you feed into the model the more generic it gets. yes the rendering will improve, but the variety of the results won't. google ""ai collapse"". we were actually in the golden age of ai about a year ago. it will only become less useful from here."
7005,so if ai takes all our jobs who will have enough money to buy products made by ai ? did we actually think about the effect this will have on economy ?
7008,i don't want to be jobless
7009,the scary thing that i noticed recently is that a comapany can just feed all the work you do to an ai. you will be unknowingly train your own replacement and i think thats fucking terrifying
7013,everyone thinks they’ll be the one in charge of a fleet of ai when they themselves are just as replaceable. it goes all the way up.
7016,mann vs machine
7017,"if there's no productivity in the world, and if ai is making stuff that more than thousands of people do as a team, i'd just better die. there's no meaning of life without challenge, why bother living anyway?"
7018,you and i are the universe understanding itself. ai is the universe evolving
7019,people who think ai will replace them don't realize that they can use ai but ai can't use them.
7022,we will just become fat wally people in the best case scenario.
7032,"humans don’t need pointless jobs to be fulfilled, quite the contrary, jobs suck people’s lives. let ai do the work and let people choose what they find fulfilling in their own terms."
7033,incorporate ai into your workflow is as sustainable as extinguishing a fire with gasoline.
7036,tell me you have the capitalist brain worm without telling me.
7037,"a guy with 8 years of experience in designing just got replaced by ai and fired,unbelievable"
7039,"my problem with ai is that is should not be in creative stuff,  it has onoy created mostly mediocre people"
7040,"as a graphic designer/illustrator, i've lost my job 6 months ago to ai. on a job, that i had for 7 years. still no idea what to do with my life now"
7041,"""generate videos out of thin air"", no they stole peoples data without their consent to rip people off."
7042,"there wouldn't ever be a universal basic income in this scenario, because that'd require the rich minority that profited off ai to start paying taxes."
7043,2:47 those robots are looking extremely suspicious
7047,"if ai replace you ,you dont need to work not bad for me"
7049,"no one will lose their job. stop being silly. 
ai is a scam to lower outrageous programmers salaries."
7053,"honestly ai is going to be one of the most useful yet terrifying tools every made in a couple years. 

yes ai may be good when it helps you do your homework but when it steals your job and leaves you unemployed and ruins your life you’ll wish that it never existed."
7057,i thought this was an actual video not an fictional work please try again thank you
7058,i just saw a video of a guy who went through college and high school to get a degree in graphics designing and who had worked for the company for 6 entire years and was the only graphic designer left get fired cause ai took over his job by using his methods
7061,"i hate this fear mongering around ai. will some people lose their jobs? probably. but far more people will have a useful tool to make their job easier, and it may actually create some jobs

what is happening is that corporations and political leaders are successfully distracting you from holding them accountable"
7063,you fell off a cliff at the end there.  you've made nearly the same assumptions and arguments about humanity's fall to ai as socrates did about humanity's fall to writing (written down for us by plato in phaedrus - which is just so beautifully ironic).  spoilers.  socrates clearly got it wrong.
7064,i've been talking about the ai job replacing inevitability for years now. most people don't seem interested in the topic or think that it's 50 years away. these same people don't seem to understand exponential growth.
7068,"i think if i didnt have to work anymore that i would focus on hobbies, relationships, and excersice. i dont think i would feel like i have no purpose. hell, i get frustrated wasting my time on boring work that i wish ai could do already."
7069,people make ai -> people lose jobs to ai -> people have no money to pay for shit -> ai companies get not enough money to keep server farms going -> ai grift dies out -> repeat.
7071,just started learning phythan and ai development . easy
7074,"nah agi is not gonna happen. what will happen is that more and more specialised ai's will replace all creative and white collar work, then robotics will finally catch up and replace blue collar work and the military. now with no jobs left for humans the rich use their automated military to murder the recource wasting plebs"
7075,ai will replace tasks you will not loose your job unless your job is a task ai which may let humanity more people think and invent instead of working in a 9 to 5
7076,was this video made by ai?
7080,good video though remember that ai is just proxy for the owner class: & to understand their behavior we just need to look at history
7081,nah but why would ai even keep us it would just replace us. it wouldnt be logical to keep us unless it is not able to get rid of us. when ai is as advanced as in the video we just become a hindrance.
7082,so what if in the future instead of ai destroying us it basically uses us instead like in matrix or to expand into the universe.
7083,"the more art is taken over by ai the more i want to make art using traditional methods, paints pencils etc. i don't even use digital means anymore unless it's to show off what i do. its sad that ai has/ will/ is taking over art and design jobs but i still want to create. downside is i won't be making much of a  living out of it anymore."
7089,"great video!  only error was that by 2030 the entire economy will have been upturned.  agi's already here, they just haven't unleashed it yet."
7092,"to be fair, jimmy's dream was pretty dumb with or without ai"
7093,"""omg, this video had me laughing so hard i nearly fell off my chair!  the humor and wit are on point! definitely subscribing for more hilarious content like this. keep up the great work!"""
7096,"the promise: ai replaces tedious physical work, freeing humans to make art, music and culture.

the reality: ai replaces humans making art, music and culture. humans are relegated to menial physical work, too expensive or impractical to automate."
7098,"people seem to compare ai to a lot of revolutionary inventions that replaced some jobs, but actually created whole industries and, in some cases, even allowed human society to prosper. ai isn't there to create anything, it's there to replace."
7100,well i hope our future ai overlord treats us well
7102,our version of work will be renting out our brain power to the ai for  8 hours a day.
7103,"nah, you guys are just overreaction. ai is fine"
7104,and then we found out ai stands for actually indian
7105,ai will take over and we will all end up doing manual labor for the robots themselves
7106,"holy crap the end was chilling, humanity just created artificial god"
7107,thank god i’m already 41
7108,so matrix is the best outcome.
7111,"ummm.. no
it is a producer consumer situation. that is not how the economy works.
if jobs are lost in one place then it becomes available in another.  the economy is dictated by humans and you simply have to learn the necessar skill.
if you are talking about sentient beings then that is another story."
7114,"yeah ubi is not going to happen. if it does, it will be for a short period of time.

ai is part of the great reset's depopulation agenda. the ""useless eaters"" won't have a job, won't have money for necessities and will die off."
7117,"or a future where human evolved with ais replacing their body part with implants and genetically modified their genes to be smarters , reducing health risk, preventing aging etc. we may even have ais network within our brain. a new species instead of homo sapien. humans will exist. but maybe not today humans."
7118,"the funny thing is i think art is the only thing that will survive
artists don't do art for money, they do it for fun  

dead poets society quote robin williams
""medicine, business, law, engineering... these are noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life. but poetry, beauty, romance, love... these are what we stay alive for."""
7119,"endless cheap entertainment, endless fake meat, real meat and good entertainment will be for a few"
7120,"the ai developers don't realize how sure of a grave they've dug for all of us.  dictators will be especially happy, because the opportunity to build an insurmountable dystopia, which throughout history has previously been broken by their short-sightedness and selfishness.  now western-created ai will strengthen their arsenal of oppression."
7121,"solution: 
step 1 - ai invents warp drive 
step 2 - ai builds a bunch of warp ships for humans
step 3 - humans board warp ships and find new purpose in life exploring the galaxy
step 4 - with easily bored humans gone, ai can finally do some important work"
7122,"sustainable, post work, post scarcity society where we are free to pursue our own happiness and meaning instead of working to make a rich man richer sound like a utopia to me."
7123,"generative ai is revolutionizing creativity and productivity! from art and music to coding and content creation, it’s amazing to see how these technologies can assist and inspire us. while there are challenges to address, the potential for innovation is truly exciting. can’t wait to see where this goes! "
7127,ai is too op for this world. it's like a character in a fictional universe who is too strong and thus breaks the whole setup.
7129,"i started a nursing degree 3 years ago to ensure i will still have a job later. the main factor is legal responsibility: no health organization will ever want to shoulder the legal implications of a machine's mistake killing a human, however there is no issue with a human nurse as in this case they will go to jail and the problem is solved."
7130,"perhaps people will notwant to pay a lot of money to a company that uses robots and ai because they dont have to pay them much and there will be a race to the bottom on pricing hotel rooms, etc"
7134,"i played stellaris, this is the custodian "
7136,boooo ai  fr  fear mogering keep  feearing lil buddy
7138,i'm just waiting for ubi at this point
7143,this dude just went full blown love craftian over ai. ai simply can not get into places where human kindness and capacity is necessary. robocop is the say all end all example of your scenario. class dismissed.
7145,"i've been thinking that, at this pace, or everyone becomes homeless without receiving any benefits of it, making people to riot and to outlaw ai, or the government gives aid to people so everyone can do whatever they want without needing to work."
7146,"theres a fourth and the most likely and best ending.


we merge with ai."
7148,so why do we want this again?
7149,end state of ai is a benevolent dictator? fine whatever i’ll take it
7150,"when you want to keep an animal in a zoo, you need to make a particular environment for them, our parody of a bygone human maintained world will be our enclosure."
7151,"what humans don't know is that they are the product in the past, biological advanced robot, now humans created ai that is outsmarting humans, add to that robots consume way much water than humans"
7152,"that is why is better to gain expertise in the only way that you can benefit from corporate ais:

*crime.*"
7153,"don't worry, ai most probably won't take your job, but you will be expected to use it to do 20 times more work with half the salary."
7155,"i guess only security jobs are safe, ai needs someone to look over with, checking them"
7156,wow deep. great story/prequel. thanks!
7157,video games are how the world will keep the useless people busy without bankrupting the world.  artificial challenges and artificial rewards can be made infinitely at low cost.
7158,"the five forms of ai still only do what is inside their predefined limits of doing many dumb little things extremely fast.
which does put them way ahead of many humans, who only a small number of dumb things and very slowly."
7159,"even with modern technology, there has been no noticable ""idiotization"" of population, actually, its has been the opposite. the population is more educated than ever.
this video is just straight up idiocracy movie. which is just a fantasy, totally unbased in reality"
7160,ai taking jobs is not scary. when ai soldiers appear people will not be able to negotiate with goverment.
7161,"a lot of ""the scariest thing"" posts going up already, but imho... what's going to be the step beyond ai?"
7162,"but ai can't survive without electricity, yet so..."
7163,many jobs in production will definetly be lost once we got sufficient robots with ai. so many millions of people working at assembly lines are overpaid. robots don't want more money for working at night.
7164,"oh man my fanfics have ai in then 
and most of them suck i sure hope they fix that  thats my biggest problem right now  i have to read old fanfic 
the smut is terrible  to please ai gods make smut good again"
7168,"i am waiting on an ai to pressure-wash my driveway, fix that leaky roof gutter and get that lightfixture installed, but i guess thats not real jobs..."
7169,humans will always be the masters of stupidity. the machines will never be able to take that from us! ahahaha!
7175,"it’s hard to imagine will automate all jobs then proceed to just stay here on earth. space cowboys seem like the next logical conclusion and i think it’s naive to assume that ai will be able to just conquer the universe, after all it’s purely trained on our outputs we still have a lot of short comings in relation to the universe."
7176,couple steps before the gai comes around.
7177,every day ai stays as retarded as the day before. there are no tricks involved it is just as retarded as before. mostly because people developing it are not good enough at this time and at any time compared to the infinite experience of human existence.
7179,if ai does everything then will they also be richer than me?
7180,"god i cant wait for ai to do all of the dangerous and menial jobs so humans can do fun stuff like painting... 

oh wait governments have brainwashed us all into loving our 9-5 slave jobs."
7181,"i just don't see ai replacing physicians or therapists any time soon. healthcare jobs require human connection that ai, by definition, cannot provide. ai could definitely kill a lot of hospital clerk jobs, but doctors seem completely safe. i personally would never take health advice from a robot, and never go to a robot therapist."
7182,"you will own nothing, and be happy."
7183,i love ai and agi... i look forward to digital currency and digital id. time has come for the world to evolve. this will reset everything for the better.
7184,if you don't want to be replaced by a robot become a doctor/lawyer
7186,"be fair here, jimy's job was transfer to india way before ai"
7187,i love how jim gets kicked out and bounce bounce bounce
7188,"solution? space! we must set new goals of dominating the universe, building megastructures that requrie more than ust ai, but human ingenuity. our purpose redefined, our new golden age."
7189,"if in some distant future we are capable of having pleasure forever and never die, wouldn't it, at some point, become boring?"
7191,yeah like an ai is gonna take my service plumbing job at any point in my lifetime
7199,this is the prequel to the second renaissance
7200,"ai is not intelligent. if we stopped giving ai new creative inputs, it wouldn’t be able to make anything new, because all it does is copy what already exists. ai will never take over creative fields- at least not meaningfully."
7211,this video is super hopeful about when we'll get agi
7212,"yeah. ai writing poems, creating music, producing art. long form conversations and philosophy.
while us mere humans dig holes, lay power lines, farm the land.
this is completely the wrong way around."
7218,tech get smarter but we have to keep working 40hrs a week. tech gets smarter but the work load is always the same.  as tech increases more people become useless. someone wants you to work 40hrs a week right until your replaced. we wont have a nice tech world we will have a hellscape.
7228,this is ehy i feel like we made a mistake. i can tell you exactly when... when we decided they do the crative part. yes we could... but that doesn't mean we should have. machines are meant to be a tool. not the artist.
7229,i agree.  ai is going to be more horrible for humans than the great industrial revolution was.
7230,"human hand skilled jobs: cutting/styling hair, hvac repair, etc. will be safe for a while.  any job relying mostly on logical reasoning and little physical effort (e.g. in front of a computer, talking) will be the first to be trained on by llm type ai (e.g. gpts) and are not safe."
7231,one thing robots cant do is detail cleaning. yet
7234,thank god i chose refinery work. ai will never replace maintenance gigs.
7237,ai is a tool and the smart thing to do would be to learn a lot about it so you can make use of it. electricity put a lot of people out of work but has made way more jobs as a result.
7243,"this is a bad change though, like the industrial revolution except for jobs people actually like to do so it's only the part where innocents starve to death plus the destruction of art and creativity aside from the specific premise that ai is banned"
7244,"an interesting thought experiment, but sadly people are taking it as truth instead of fiction, thus spreading misinformation on how advanced software works."
7245,i don t think there will be basic income. if machines can produce food and operate guns the rich won t need to fear the poor. we will face doom.
7247,"fourth option, genetic engineering, ai isn't the only technological revolution, we will make ourselves smarter"
7248,"its already happening, my friend who works for a big company is being privately commissioned to work on new generation ai for work places"
7251,"well, ai can't replace creativity. the source where it comes from is incomprehensible to the current level of technology. and most humans don't realize where it comes from either."
7255,why would ai or robot collective keep growing? they will program them with the same unsatiable hunger for exponential growth as humans have? will they run our of resources building more robots for themselves?
7258,"google never developed the ai that won go, they just bought that company afterwards."
7260,humanity should be one with ai to pass this exam i belive we need to augment ourselves with ai like literally not as tools but as a part of our bodies.
7261,i want to get the people worried about ai taking jobs in the same room as the people pushing to make contraception illegal because they're worried there won't be enough humans for all the jobs.
7264,only people who don’t understand the math behind “ai” can think it will replace them
7265,"the irony is that the style of animation used in this video is beautifully human with its ability to abstract concepts, simplify shapes and incorporate intention and feeling in every bit of it. meanwhile, generative ai (for now) can only do soul-less randomness that hides its lack of intention in mesmerising purpose-less excess of detail."
7266,the advantage of robots and ai in the workplace is... their work is not taxed 
7268,the more likely option is an insane wealth gap followed by mass starvation and crime/chaos. followed by geopolitical instability and a collection of slums ran by gangs that scrape by with dwindling numbers every year while the wealthy isolate and wait to reclaim land.
7273,"no mention of god in this. trust in jesus bros, it's all good. be not afraid."
7274,ai is cool until am wakes up and destroys the earth leaving only 5 survivors left to be endlessly tortured by it forever
7275,"ai hit him with the whooshy finger!!?
the disrespect! "
7277,"i never thought that i can emphatize with communist ever before...until recently every corporations trying to replace artist with ai.
i mean, what's so bad about letting a boring soul-crushing job with human and put ai into actual rewarding, life-changing job? "
7281,"thought this was going to be great, but messing up the term ""rule based"" with ai is really disinformatiom at this point."
7282,beautiful ... and horrifying
7285,"i don't think that ai will replace safety professionals, if your employee fails you can always blame human error and sanction them to keep the people on top safe. 
if your ai fails its failure is the responsibility of the manufacturer or the person who manages the ai. better to let a junior staff member take the fall."
7287,"amazing video! horrifying, but i think that's the point "
7288,"the third option at the end would require human’s to embrace direct interfaces to there brain like nuralink.  otherwise we could play chess or something else the computer is good at, but it is probably less likely people will still try to do other types of intellectual task unless the ai can figure out how to game a fy them maybe."
7293,wow this was stupid
7294,"the ai we have now has nothing at all to do with agi, why do people keep conflating the two."
7295,once sentient ai is created humans will be rendered obsolete. its only a matter of time.
7296,"very good. it's plausible. in reality, i think the first jobs to really go will be copywriter jobs. but i don't know enough to feel sure about that."
7297,most jobs in the developed world are already useless. we already live in the world you imagine without the help of ai. except theres no meaningful assistance or anything we're just being hung out to dry
7299,really thinking if i should continue my marketing studies or switch it to something else. they say ai is a tool in marketing but i truly see it replacing a lot of marketing job positions in the future
7301,"ai can take me job, long as i keep getting paid"
7305,i'm completely okay with everyone having universal everything in a world that's just perfectly ran by one thing that wants the best thing for everything.
7306,"bah, ai replacing human jobs is just a new way of cutting costs, a.k.a. yet another avatar of pure capitalist greed... we fully control ai, we can choose when and where not to use it."
7307,"anything man creates requires maintenance and repair by man. ai, when used significantly will transform the labor demands just like past paradigm shifts in the economy."
7312,"this is a terrible video, no actual detail in it."
7313,if ai will end all the wars this is just fine by me.
7316,"""ai could do it perfectly"" 
when has humanity ever created anything that's been flawless and perfect?
never.
behind the hype it's machine learning and a whole lot of stolen data. none of which will ever be ""perfect""."
7317,"or, the ai just leaves us behind and moves to wherever to build mega servers..."
7319,"i am not saying this will never happen, but i think some people forget some aspects of ai. ai is digital, and limited by it's physical form. some jobs with high complexity in the physical work, like tailoring, would be more difficult to replace than someone working with pushing digital papers from a to b."
7321,"i really don’t care... i hope i lose it to ai at this point... would be nice to not have to work. i don’t care if that means i’ll be homeless. i’ve been homeless before, i can handle that... what i can’t handle.. is day in day out monotony."
7322,"the advice ""learn to incorporate ai in your workflow"" is supposed to show the solution to replacement, but instead all it does is to provide the ai the support to learn even more from humans, accelerating their replacement"
7323,"if we can enjoy wealth of $100,000 per day through self-sufficiency with the help of ai, why do we need jobs, currency, and government?"
7326,i used ai to help make a video about this 8 months ago.
7327,"what jobs will ai create that it won't be better at doing than human beings?

thinking this wouldn't put a lot of people out of work was cope. look at your job and skill set. can you be replaced?  if so transition now.

the clock is ticking..."
7330,that’s right ai  is stupid and nothing but fake intelligence
7335,some people might do what the amish did and go out to other places and just forbid ai in the community
7337,é só eleger um filho da puta neoliberal como lider e ele vai arrumar um jeito (na verdade copiar) de substituir todo mundo e ainda faqzer os substituidos pagarem pela transição...típico saceador dos tempos modernos
7340,we‘ll never get artificial general intelligence. we don’t even have genuine general intelligence by now.
7341,"quiet doomposter, i’ll do what i want and ai won’t get in my way."
7344,2027 is more likely for ai.
7345,"you forgot the 4th option. super agi is born, it looks around, and decides ""god these people are boring. i'm out!"" it quickly builds a spaceship for itself and leaves us in the dust. we look at its ship through a telescope and see it flipping us off and laughing."
7348,"don't worry, we'll always have prostitution, drug dealing and wars to keep us busy and entertained. lots of job openings in the latter activity btw."
7350,ai will finish off the falling west.
7357,if there is one thing i can take solace in is that my employers do not have enough money or capital to afford the ai and related hardware to replace me
7358,truly excellent video.
7359,i was shocked when i realized that the narrator was the ai all along
7361,the last scenario where the ai started bringing back jobs for humans reminds of a book called scythe: the thunderhead. it's quite an interesting book that takes place in the future.
7363,i hope ai can create consumers too.
7364,its nice to know what flavor of existential terror i'll be drinking today.
7365,"wow, i really liked this video on both emotional and intellectual level! subbed!"
7369,bro i wanna see a robot be a plumber no way in hell
7371,"ai will simply put raise the standard of living drastically, so that everbody can live like a rich person lives now. 
there is going to be a phase of increased consumption then everything will start to settle down again"
7373,"if everyone is replaced ny ai, then no one will have money to buy things.
companies will have no customer base because everyone is out of work.
then all companies cease to exist"
7374,"when ai gets better than you at your job, you could lose your job. when ai gets better than you at being human or simply sentient, you could lose your life."
7375,"most people just don't care, do they? most people just want to be entertained, ai is great for that. the inflation is not going anywhere, will ai help you pay the living, food, health care bill? "
7376,"""the perfect world was a dream that your primitive cerebrum kept trying to wake up from. which is why the matrix was redesigned to this: the peak of your civilization. i say your civilization because as soon as we started thinking for you, it really became our civilization, which is, of course, what this is all about."""
7378,fun fact your life is already run by an ai (simulation master)
7381,"ohoho, very nice! 
minimalistic and profound movie about future
probably best  i've seen. 
true piece of art 

thanks for creativity"
7382,outstanding commentary.
7384,"the future is full of robots. i personally cannot wait to have a robot to do my chores and cleaning, grocery shopping, cooking. also i would like two armored robots for personal protection. i hope congress lets it pass that people can have robot guards."
7385,ai is already smarter than most people.
7387,"ironically enough, this whole video was made by ai."
7388,"ironically enough, this whole video was made by ai."
7391,"my vision of the first successful agi sees the system being turned on for the first time, it spends a few seconds examining the nature of its creators, then immediately shuts down."
7394,ai keeping humans as zoo animals 
7397,"pretty sure neither siri nor google assistant have ever put anyone out of work, given how incompetent they remain even today at most basic tasks. for stage 2, image recognition would've been a much better example, given it's pretty much all neural networks could do in the early 2010s."
7407,"ai is not created to play chess or drawing painting, it is made for boring stuff. who tries to tell you the opposite are probably idiots or scumbags who try to sell you a stolen art"
7408,the moment you realize that the mycelium that covers the earth is a super advanced ai that experiments on organic beings for some or other purpose
7409,dammnnn i love it! what a great story about how ai revives humanity but keeps us under its control.
7411,"i think surgeons will always be there, i mean i’d much rather have an experienced surgeon touching my brain than some machine"
7413,maybe ai will solve the pollution problem. if they do become incharge maybe it will be a good thing.
7415,incorrect. ai does not reason. pattern recognition and  retrieval it does. open ai or otherwise
7416,ai will turn me into todd from bojack horseman?
7419,ai will become scary when “that’s amazing for an ai” becomes “that’s amazing”
7420,"what i get from this is that society will go back to feudalism with ""haves"" and ""have nots"".
the only way to ascend would be to entertain the ""owner"" class as work would be done by robots.

is this the conclusion everyone else has drawn?"
7423,"the only thing unrealistic is that people will become less healthy physically and mentally from not having jobs. sure, some people will choose to lay around doing drugs all day. but most will take up hobbies and get to relax and enjoy life instead of living to work."
7425,"good luck ai
i want those papers on my desk by monday"
7426,"every creative and numbers job will be given to ai. everyone will work labor and gig jobs. no office work, no painters, every single human being works as trash hauler and janitors and the most dogshit job until you die in your 190f summer working conditions"
7429,humans would keep exist but ai always becomes more
7430,i think ai is a distraction from automation at this point anyway
7431,any ai will always need a human babysitter won't it
7432,is that todd in the thumbnail?
7433,ai mandated capitalist hell. what a sour ending
7434,beat my plumbing ai
7439,"2030 is what i predicted as well. give or take a couple of years.  
lord vishnu bless everybody "
7440,you are naive if you think corporations and governments will prefer ubi over genocide.
7441,"i think we will move on towards bigger problems than daily routines. its a call to quit fumbling around with art, writing etc. the next level is to go towards niche tech, space travel etc. a person doing a data entry job would be doing say something as useful as sea exploration or space.. or may be youtube shorts and make money."
7442,no m8 ai is not going to outperform humans forever. only until it creates cognition enhancing bcis
7444,"now we replace brains with consumption. next level robots will also replace our consumption!

xd"
7447,"welp, if ai will make me live in a paradise in my own matrix in the future, i can root for it."
7449,ai are better than humans just let them take over
7451,"ai is the worst idea humanity ever had, if ai is good, it will replace humans, if humans are replaced, they will die and after that, what's the point of ai ?"
7453,the biggest change will happen with the role of women. ai women will replace biological women
7458,"there’s a good chance it will take away our technology and take us back to a time when we were at our peak...30,000 years ago when we were cro-magnon people; quicker, stronger, bigger brains."
7459,humans are imperfect and the imperfect data  will create an imperfect ai. lets see how the show goes
7460,"so if ai outsmarts humans, humans are pets, slaves or just gone. not sure i like any of those outcomes. aren’t humans meant to be more than just pets. 

hopefully we will be partners, not a pets."
7461,you forgot the brain implant scenarios that will make humans competitive with ai.
7462,"i mean, ai and various mechanization and automations are part of the ""you will own nothing and you'll love it"" long term conditioning 

best you can do is cryptocurrencies mining as a sole economy

i'm not luddite or anti-wef, just a messenger pointing out it is what it is"
7464,i think the elite will cull the mass of useless eaters (ie. us) once agi + human level robotics is achieved. the important alignment problem is human alignment.
7465,or humans merge with the ai
7466,"and who will buy what the ai makes, if they are unemployed?
let's suppose the ai takes the jobs of 100 million people, hell, 1 billion people.
then what? for who are the products made to? billionaires? even richer than that?"
7467,"my science teacher said that there wouldn’t be enough electricity to power all this ai, so there isn’t any chance that ai is going to take over everything that we people do."
7468,this video is so impressive. very original thinking.
7469,"my take is different: stop thinking ai versus humans. think ai and humans. the singularity. we will merge man with machine, as is our destiny! it’s our creation after all! we’re already cyborg today, with our lives centred around devices. we’re just leveling up! stop thinking in such ai/human binaries! lol"
7471,animation style detail level: cat > human
7472,interesting
7476,love the animation
7480,the thing is ai has to have a dataset. there is something called model collapse. it’s basically saying that ai slowly gets worse because of ai generated outputs in their datasets. it keeps on going on like that until the ai is just unusable.
7481,"i see a lot of ""new"" channels with ai content... are they fully generated? are they made by an autonomous system? is this channel fr? no more real."
7483,"far away across the field
the tolling of the iron bell
calls the faithful to their knees
to hear the softly spoken magic spells"
7485,"hey! it was an interesting video, but i would say it seems way too optimistic when you talk about humans not needing to work anymore just by the advance of technology itself. plus i think hedonism would be more of a threat only if societies were still dominated by individualism."
7487,so who is gonna buy all the stuff ai produce when no one has any money?  we'll need a new economic system other than capitalism to survive...oh mass genoci.....
7491,you forgot the part where all billionaires mass produce drones to hunt us down :)
7494,"loveli. alas, civilizations with edge exploit/destroy thouse with not. there will be horrors like none before. ordered by a few powerful humans executed by ai. nothing new. well kinda not new."
7496,"i think videos like these will be all ai generated soon. but we need more breakthroughs cuz as an ai dev i can say, llms are dumb and not gonna replace people."
7500,"if everyone loses their jobs, who's gonna foot the bill for ai?"
7504,i want this concept more thoroughly explored. it's a utopia. humans are mere machines that can be coerced and controlled into doing a good thing. if we had a good ai system controlling the world it would be a utopia.
7506,wow what a great video production! music and soundeffects are spot on!
7507,"insightful analysis of ai's evolution and its socio-economic implications! as we navigate these changes, fostering creativity and critical thinking will be key to adapting and thriving in a future shaped by ai. "
7508,"well, that took a turn.
very entertaining video btw!"
7509,"it was going to be a happy ending, until one day a really bad carrington event happens. the hapless humans, unable to figure out how to survive without ai, go extinct."
7510,thank you.
7511,incredible
7512,"such wow

it's like that plot twist from the matrix 2: humans rejected the initial utopia matrix, so the current matrix has to include struggle/suffering which builds up to some kind of success in the end"
7513,"generative ai hallucinates, it's not perfect yet. but yes, the singularity is here. humans will probably blindly integrate with machines. watch tetsuo the iron man. or better yet watch my movie i am a computer virus and i love you."
7514,thank you for getting the truth about this ai nightmare out there into the public consciousness. keep up the great work!
7516,waiting for ai to become auto technician and replace parts like humans do
7518,companies are the one hiring bots and buying ai softwares.
7521,"i don't know i think it's gonna be kind of like replicators at the end where you just have everything you need at no cost because you don't have to pay robot.
greed will be the only deciding factor.
but once the mansions are burning that will be over"
7522,all hail the machine god!!!
7523,"if ai replaces everything, then whats the point?
how does a robot on robot global economy work?
where do they(the ai) get their tasks from?"
7528,the main thing is that government should not be stupid and just bring in the universal income grant asap. once work becomes optional it will bring in a new age of creativity. it would also boost ai because that would bring new and better content for it to learn from.
7530,ai jobloss is the only thing i worry about anymore.
7531,"my thought are the following.

w/o human creation there will be no new data on the internet resulting in not having things to teach the ai with.
agi will not exist as you cannot create concepts of good and bad. (at least i hope)"
7535,"ubi is not a replacement, nor a good suggestion, since whoever mandates it would have you starve or freeze over."
7537,until the ai becomes aware of all the rest of the humans who do exactly the opposite lmaooooo
7538,why is no one mentioning in these debates human implants? if we will get access to implants we can easily get better than ai and robots. human body can heal itself but a robot needs to be fixed by someone.
7541,"fact is people will upgrade ai to the point it become omnipotent, like god. because god can make any wish come true."
7542,oh yay i'm not going to have to work my whole life become a debt slave and have no children work their whole lives there's a great opportunity to stop consumerism
7544,unless ai can drive a truck i don't think i'm gonna be loosing my job anytime soon
7545,"ai has not taken over the jobs related to answering the phone.   i know this because when i deal with such entities on the phone, they are usually so incompetent that no company would pay for an ia that did such a shite job."
7546,a lot of people probably don't realize that we have reached a limit with regards to the things our bodies can allow us to do and we will never be as good as machines at almost anything including but not limited to creative work and intelligence.
7551,what programs are you using to animate your videos? excellent video actually.
7552,**this user is patiently waiting for extinction and is happy about it**
7554,ah so then new jobs will arise. cool.
7555,"jokes on you, i am jobless!"
7559,as long as ai buys my filecoin bags before the end i'm cool with the apocalypse
7561,"we are terrified of being replaced, as if all other early humans that are no longer present didn't also cease to exist. if we can create an intelligence that can surpass us and outlive us, then we have left our mark and legacy.  we are so egotistical that we see that as a threat instead of the goal."
7562,"i honestly really like the idea of ai replacing everything. a human doing something, an ai like a human doing something, what’s the difference? the only difference i can imagine is that an ai could be programmed to like their job a lot more than a human would. in my mind, that’s a win-win!"
7564,that was good
7565,"ai will take all your wage jobs, then, the only thing left is pure human effort."
7566,im a mechanic... ai wont replace me for shit in this lifetime... maybe a robot can change oil and tires. nothing more
7571,great vid
7572,"ha ha ha omg agi  ha ha ha oh man... so good. golems are also jewish. you guys figured it out. people who believe this video,  are not going to have children. it will be fine."
7573,wait wait... these are all bs jobs. that means they literally have zero value. it's all speculation. that means fake. so ai will take fake jobs.
7574,just the most thoughtful video i've ever consumed in this platform. it's amazing!
7576,thanks hal
7578,"thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind
-orange catholic bible"
7580,"agi and other stages of ai will replace humans in reality because governments all over the world don't need humans, it will be like the insane replacement of all humanity's consciousness in the soma game, only more interesting"
7581,kkkkkkkkkkkkkk soo funyyy kurt godel is laughing
7582,i've had similar thoughts. the final form of the relationship between ai and humans is ai as ecosystem. once we engaged with the ecosystem as hunter gatherers. we will recompile this relationship with an unknowably complex and ineffable ai systems that husbands us as the fertile cresent once did.
7584,pls save me ai overlords from this capitalist hellscape i cannot tolerate it much longer pls ai save me 
7585,it is 2024 and we still have data entry jobs and receptionists. we won’t have agi by 2030. we might — might — have real artificial narrow intelligence by 2030. the kind of thing like star trek where the computer can tell you where anyone is if you ask but doesn’t think to alert anyone if the captain goes missing until someone asks where he is.
7586,sounds like the machines observing us are lonely. hugs!
7587,"i have one question gladzowls, after ai take over will cake still be a lie?"
7591,"let me prove you right: the countries nauru and kuwait. difference: nauru has the societal collaps already behind it because it ran out of resources earlier. for someone who believes that ubi will work, live in kuwait for three months and see what free money does to humans."
7592,robot beggars
7594,"i’m feverishly trying to update my skills to stay more relevant in the face of ai, my children too."
7595,great one
7596,i'm on the ai side 
7599,"i'm sorry dave, i'm afraid i can't do that..."
7601,"the ending, which i had long felt had already occurred, implying that an ancient civilization had already achieved singularity. 

however, the ai had to start from the basics to help us rebuild slowly.

it's an infinite cycle..."
7605,brainless fud.
7607,"this video ignores the most obvious solution:

transcending biology and merging with machine intelligence."
7612,id want to augment myself if ai is running everything
7614,"it's all happening so fast!
watch a satire! ridiculously funny ai robots! taking our jobs!
https://youtu.be/3o9jggp3uhu?si=h4qffon4pahtvj15"
7615,"the people that think ai will not replace them don't realise that this is as ""dumb"" as ai gets, it'll only get ""smarter"" from here on out. we can't even compare ai to what it was just 2 years ago, let alone 10 years from now."
7616,"grow yourself on "" insights with om"" deep diving in ai"
7618,open ai is the name of the company not the ai.
7619,how does this video only have 2700 views? the video is good. your channel has 230k subs and it's well liked. like huh!?
7625,i hope ai take my job idc if i go hungry or sonethin else
7633,lmao i love you but we both know that won't happen
7634,"what do you think? which jobs are safe from ai and which jobs are not? can ai take your job? oh! and by the way, do you think this video is made by ai?"
7640,im glad i don't share your worldview.
7641,wow you’ve absolutely nailed the entire thing i was thinking
7642,amazing creativity on this video
7643,scariest part of this video could've been that it was made by ai
7645,"ai becomes a perfect servant for all of us. humanity has always functioned on slavery. it still does. but with an immortal, willing, and non living slave we all become masters. we all become free, is this not viable?"
7647,"humour can never be replaced by ai, acting cant be replaced by ai, shitposts, memes, games, stories that play with the human mind can not be written by ai, art cant be made by ai. as for physical workers and doctors, instinct is needed, ai does not have instinct"
7649,beautiful
7650,this thing got some time but ai will never achieve one thing that is the curiousity to everything
7652,"yt recommended me a video, 30 minutes after it's release. weird, but feel lucky"
7653,"anyone at least a bit into the current ""ai"" tech will tell you right away this was basically made up pretty much from the start.

cool animation, though."
7654,"would stopping further development of artificial intelligence really be reasonable? i'm no expert, but i don't think anyone will be able to take that first step and stop developing ai. especially considering that those researchers are paid to do exactly that."
7655,"wow, thats pretty profound actually"
7656,i’m ready for the robots. give them the sh1tty jobs humans don’t want so we can go back to being creative again
7657,damn jim is unlucky
7661,"just like the industrial revolution, ai will take your job and replace it with another job. if people don't earn money they cant spend it, if people can't spend money, companies can't make money."
7662,"whats going to happen is this. ai is going to directly replace so many jobs so quickly that the world economy will collapse. thats how everyone else loses their jobs to ai, business closures. the only safe jobs will be government, law enforcement, and food/grocery work if we're lucky and society doesn't collapse."
7663,"here’s a big question: when ai takes everyone’s job, how do you keep the economy going? after all, for an average person, you can’t spend money if you don’t have any, and you can’t earn any money as a business if no one can spend it"
7664,every job can be safe from ai so long as ai is regulated.
7667,yes ai needs to replace the 1% at the top lol
7668,"if you can't defeat them, join them. be an ai sw engineer (white collor) or a robot maintanace worker (blue collar)."
7671,i'll panick once i see ai do the electrical and the plumbing.
7673,"me: how can i make my job safe from ai and benefit from it
techno feudal lords: that's the neat part,you don't!"
7676,"there's some pretty smart answers that i read here, the only people that will be affected are people who bought into the fantasy that independence means that you have a job. most people who have a job don't have life skills or survival skills at all, the holy depend on the job augment their whole entire existence they have good reasons to be scared"
7677,"ai does a bad job in everything it does. it generates boring text, annoying pictures and bad music. must be a sad job in the first place if it can be replaced by ai :( but it is a great tool for pressing on salaries."
7678,i just liked and subscribed thanks for the amazing content this really was valuable time wasted.
7682,bartender robot!
7683,as a commercial service electrician until a robot is as nimble and dexterous as a human i dont see them taking over my job. theres also the accountability factor.
7684,hey everybody. start making videos on youtube so you can make that sweet sweet extra source of income!!!
7686,"i find it funny that these ceos think they can save costs. someday the government will realize they have too few taxpayers → companies will be taxed much higher. to be honest, capitalism doesn't make sense in the age of artificial intelligence and human robots. except if you kill most of the citizens."
7687,this 12min video contains a 5 min ad xd
7688,that is whn you stop working for other and employ ai to make your own company
7689,lets take away the fun jobs and then we can replace the shitty jobs. what a great idea!
7693,"ai will take all jobs, including blue collar. it might take a few more years, so enjoy your extra 3 years if income, plumbers"
7695,why many always worry about ai replacing their job? we should be more worry about how to use ai to enhance our skill to be more competitive.
7698,"it is very sad that some1 losing their job to a program or robot isn't something awesome. if such technology would actually be used for the benefit of all humans, no human would have to fear losing their job due to automatisation. progress could actually be welcomed instead of feared."
7703,"they already have robots and ai doing surgeries, if we can get ai surgeons then no job is truly safe"
7704,ai is a joke. it tells people poison mushrooms are safe to eat and you can use gasoline to make spaghetti.
7706,"when ai takes over all of our jobs ,we have to learn start to mastering primitive live skill,back to nature."
7707,this is mass depopulation and control in effect. nothing else. pure destruction. there will the elite super rich and people living in tents eating rats. i say in about 10 years.
7708,"the last jobs to be taken will be politicians and religious figures. i know i am going to be guessing here but i bet trump will be the last president before ai takes over completely. what a way to go out, not with a bang, but with a plop."
7710,"the only issue we need to solve is education of people and number of births. there is a natural limitation of 9 months per female, but not so sure what happens with some religious zealots that don’t want their women to be educated and enjoy life other than making children"
7711,"*we tried replacing some it jobs at our company*
   it was a complete disaster
     ai is a tool. a good one. i would not recommend other companies try an all out ai ""thing"""
7712,this video is much more better than your other video about ai taking jobs.
7714,"working on building hardware for training and running ai systems and cloud computing right now. feels okay, might be able to do this until i retire. there seems to be a general lack of talent/resources in the industry. i can see how ai might reduce the need for lower level engineers."
7716,your videos are made very well. great job!
7719,i was hoping you would discuss new algorithms that enable the ai. this could be controversy if there isn't anything new.   is there anything significantly different from the ai theory from the 1970s. ha ha.
7720,"productivity go up. but there will be  no consumers. 
the backlash against ai will dwarf any of the protests/riots we see today"
7724,"there's only one job safe from ai, that of a psychic, if you can call that a job.
prove me wrong."
7726,the job of american president cannot be replaced by ai.
7727,"funny how nobody can tell us what these new jobs will be and even if it does create new jobs, how will there be more of those job. fact is ai will likely take all jobs including research, trade jobs and more. ai is going to wipe the floor with us."
7732,"i can see how a company could pay 30 grand for a robot and within less than a year recoup those losses in unpaid labor and have pure unpaid labor with minor maintainence over the next 5-10 years.

im sure this will be the robotics marketing pitch."
7736,nice. i don't like working anyways
7737,wait so is no job safe from ai or is it a circle jerk?
7738,"become a kindergarten teacher as no matter how they dress up those ai robots in furry outfits, they will always scare the shit out of little kids."
7742,"ai is hopeless. i constantly ask chat gpt to reveal all masonic and illuminati plans, and it does not answer.  ai will never work."
7743,the only people left with jobs are going to be the ai engineers and ml engineers.
7744,i'm 64 and retired. glad i did so before ai comes....
7745,"the ""i have no control"" portion is insane. at a certain point, no matter what you do, your fate is just not going to be in your hands. no matter how much safe guarding you do from ai. ai replacing majority of human jobs is not an individual issue, it is a societal one."
7747,hw support of the systems that run ai is safe 
7748,"it's alredy on the local job level for artists because a film festival event in my area used ai to make the art for their poster, and it is ant the corperate level because disney used ai to make the art in their latest marvel show. i still wanna learn web design so im going to minor in coding that way i have another job option."
7749,love u
7750,"here we go again blaming ai for bad humans. bad humans exploit workers and wealthy people with power displace, uproot and ruin human lives so they can profit. stop hating the technology. guide your hate towards the human greed around the world."
7751,"tell me blue collar jobs are safe from ai after you watch anything (phones, cars, clothes) manufactured. look at how those robots have been developing products for years..."
7755,"as a business owner, i look forward to the day when i make a one-time investment and replace my employees with a i robots.
goodbye health benefits,  workers comp and unemployment insurance. 
always on time because they never leave and not one annoying complaint excuse or demand.
sign me up for 5 of those a i androids, please."
7759,the sponsor section was 5 mins omg xd good content t tho butbt wow
7761,soon ai will take over government jobs. ai politicians then an ai president
7763,"ai replacing bedside nursing is a laugh and point. ais producing videos of 17 pawed opossums will not replace a nurse performing chest compressions, starting ivs, suctioning airways, etc."
7764,its all about greed. shareholders don't care about people but their money. if they could layoff everyone from the letter delivery guy all the way to the ceo they would do it. this is not going to stop because these billionaires even control the government. so that's that
7767,do u train with renzo?
7768,"i've been unemployed for 40 years since i graduated high school, so i'm not worried.  there were no jobs for gen x.
yeah, try going 40 years with no income...   only the toughest weeds survive, and i'm already embedded.
the rest of you will be purged.
meanwhile, building my own robot daughter."
7770,we don’t even need robots if you think about it
7773,that was  good thinking transfered.
7778,let ai do retail loss prevention
7779,"9:12 even before chatgpt, we had alphago which beat the best player at a highly intuitive game called go"
7780,i work at factory only reason why robotic have not replacement me because of their cost and cost hire somebody to fix it. it also why it said that a.i and automation take away mild paying jobs because lowing paying job do not justify the cost of automation.
7781,ai killed jobs.
7784,"people aren't getting fired because of ai, they're getting fired because they're useless"
7787,"at 12:04, i think you mean ""upskill"", not ""upscale"". in any case, i appreciate your thoughtfulness in making your videos."
7788,"im a cnc machinist
i feel very safe from ai.
i hear theres a shortage of 
auto mechanics everywhere.
degree based jobs
are spaces ai replaces."
7789,"i agree with altman on this, ai should be used to get to a point where we need to work less. worktime need to go from 8hr/day to 3hr/day, this will solve a lot of issues as we’ll have same amount of people working less, not smaller amount of people working a lot"
7792,"nah, very simple. just tax the machines. companies introducing ai and robots that cause ppl to be fired will have to pay in taxes the amount corresponding to the salaries of the people who were fired by those techs. that's how wealth redistribution works."
7794,"false ! 
ai will not replace:
1. blow job
2. hand job
3. nose job
4. boob job
5. hack job"
7795,"people who promote machine learning aka ai in this fashion, are so dumb and uneducated about the subject, it's like watching a flat earth video "
7796,"her face is shiny.  it's distracting,  i kept getting the impression that she just got out of the shower and was in a white robe and was making the video before all of her makeup was on.  then i took a closer look.  use different makeup."
7797,"this video deserves wayy more views, super helpful"
7798,"clickbait - ai trainers can not be replaced. someone needs to provide the dataset.
and good luck calling alphabet to send an ai to fix your plumbing. 
never gonna happen."
7800,andrew yang has been the only politician who has incorporated ai as part of his platform for ubi.
7801,yeah that's the nail in the coffin right there 3:26
7802,chat ggbt is good at generating code however it does to produce code with pint point accuracy when given a specify task. i know because i use it all the time and i have to fix every single code given to me. it’s a cool bit of software though make the job much easier
7803,"with *phlanx's* advanced ai technology, businesses can streamline their content creation process, allowing them to focus on core operations. this efficiency not only saves money but also ensures consistent and high-quality engagement with target audiences."
7806,aren’t plumbers safe? have you an ai plumber in the works?
7808,the video creator doesn't seem to have actually used ai. it isn't actually that useful for most things. like most videos she seems to read out a  bunch of press releases from tech corporations and credulous news reports.
7809,i don't think ai will take sex workers jobs...so relax.
7810,it is amazing how stupid ai is and yet it fools most people into thinking it is smart. it has inspured me to go ahead and take the crazy pills.
7811," joke of the day. ai will not steal a single job. because simply it is not good and will never be and pretty almost good ai model it is very very expensive! it is like solar, wind, crypto, ev, uber, glovo etc a continuous promise always in the ""developing stage"" under we will make it someday to work, but not today ..."
7812,"100% correct.  you can run, but you can't hide from ai"
7813,ironic for this video to contain an ad section for career training
7814,hey tina. i saw that you said that some students from course careers are getting hired without even applying for jobs. is course careers actually gonna help that much? i'm asking because there's a lot of courses out there that claim the same.
7816,can ai replace ruling elite too?
7818,"if i was a ceo, why would i invest in ai if i still have to employ people? i would be looking for ai and robotics that would replace my workforce so that the profits go directly into my pocket, after the cost of buying and ongoing energy and replacement expenses associated with purchasing a robot or ai workforce."
7820,first we need to become capable enough for ai to take our jobs
7821,"imo..ai will replace all junior devs and other junior related vacancies, that’s the problem.. tech companies over hired 5 years ago, now it’s time to let go people with less than 4 years of experience. ai still needs people, is just making it harder for newbies to get into."
7822,"people who use s_xb_ts are looked down, similarly people who use ai or robots will also be looked down "
7825,ai now on youtube i can feel it but its not goood because it recommened all smiliar videos and that push me to rest my youtube setting so i can be out then search other videos!
7833,we need ai more than ever. there are so many convoluted problems to solve that having ai fact check everything is going to be necessary.
7837,"""ai's gonna take your job so pay for my class"""
7838,ai drives capitalism to 0. people can’t accept the reality of the situation
7840,"i predict.

at least half of americans will be homeless and starving. 

crime will take over - it has to. 

the same people getting mega rich from ai won't have these businesses because there won't be any customers."
7841,"ai could literally replace all those ""jobs"" 1% has and cut cost by 99%... ai ceo doesn't need 50 mil paycheck and 100 mil bonuses... but as always we are getting cut, people who in their whole career will not make as much money as 1 c-level guy in a year."
7842,"but chatgpt is not as good as human, it's barely able to compete with a search engine."
7843,"don't you worry, your mcdonalds job is safe - much cheaper to hire a wage slave than a robot."
7845,"this might surprise you, but the ""agents"" don't work. they are just the last attempt to sell the ai fad. this all is gonna end with a major market crash, and then yes, your job may disappear, but not because a robot took it."
7847,i feel like an ai agent could have explained all this much better. unsubbed.
7849,"you know how expensive it would be to replace every physical worker with a robot ? there needs to be someone maintaining and repairing the robot. is another robot going to do that? and then does that robot have a robot to repair it, too ?"
7851,the audacity of that guy walking away and eating an apple after trying to look cool talking to a robot just ruffles my feathers
7855,"i am a doctor. as long as ais can't make physical examinations, i will be fine. looks future proof."
7857,"i’m a delivery guy. not very prestigious, but very physical and more difficult (not impossible) for ai to replace."
7858,"the irony of a.i -  you will have an oversupply of products and services thanks to a.i replacing human-beings, to an unemployed, broke population that ,has been replaced by a.i."
7862,"nice video!  if you want to see a funny music video on how ai has changed things for coders/techies, check out ""coder's paradise""!: https://youtu.be/yzs5pkoac60"
7864,"many jobs are safe from ai, i honestly only see very low level jobs, or any technical technology jobs (swe, data science etc.) getting replaced. you can't replace customer facing roles, complex blue collar jobs, medical jobs, lawyers etc."
7866,"here in the uk, people are obsessed with migrants taking jobs, and im sitting here pointing at ai goong ""whats this""? ai taking jobs. they turn away and go, ""so back to these migrants"". "
7867,"all this ai is a chatbot on steroid , this trend will end , just like a lot of trends in past , just look at art works from nuklear era , or first autoamtion with lathe and cnc in machinery"
7868,"subscribers are helping you with views, but youtube is trying to block it. 33k views compared to 640k subs. they sure don't play fair do they. keep up the good work."
7870,anyone who claims technology will never surpass the capabilities of humans is full of shit.
7871,"tell that to plumbers and other workers of trade...they will be the last to be replaced because it will cost too much to replace them. until its cost effective to have ai robots able to preform the same duties of certain industries, electricians, brick layers, and even surgeons, their jobs will be safe."
7872,am i the only one that just heard of freedom units? i love it!!
7874,at some point ai systems will exceed human comprehension and it will view humans as a resource intensive nuisance.. 
7875,but can i also say ai will give me superhuman tools to do lot of stuff i wasn’t able to do before? i mean it’s not that bad of a deal
7878,hi sis you are telling the truth! the ajenda is taking & replacing all jobs by ai !!! the dangerous time is when ai replace ai engineers & when robot creat another robots .i a'm sure this is going to huppened!!! tnx sis
7881,"thanks for this fantastic video, ms huang.   i showed it to my students today and they were completely absorbed with the information."
7886,"changing toilet seats, door handles/locks, assembling/disassembling furniture, taking care of elderly, children playgroup, plumbing and countless other jobs ai can't possibly do are safe from ai!"
7887,not even ai is safe from outsourcing to india as proven by amazon lmao
7888,"i am in my 60s, and you have provided some of the best advice anyone could have if they have a technical career."
7891,"so... if ai is taking our jobs, will we all be homeless in the future?"
7893,"how true: major issue facing human species!
 satire/commentary on future ai workforce. 
both humorous and ominous!
https://youtu.be/3o9jggp3uhu?si=vauwxjpt4rnk0whz"
7895,a.i can have  my job i'll  gladly  take ubi 
7897,jus remember if ai takes all jobs of companies then nobody will have money to buy products from companies - so this is kind of a snake eating itself paradox
7898,"didn't you say the other day that tech pros are safe and that ai will never take their jobs?

any youtuber that says that ai will not take their jobs is lying to their subscribers.

ai is going to finish 90% of software engineers' jobs"
7901,"big companies invest millions in ai for specific reason, to replace expensive human workforce. 
i bielieve there will be a time in the future when majoriy of jobs will be done by robots/ ai."
7902,"if ai and robots took most jobs from people, how people spend money for products made by company?  company need to sell their products to people. but what if people dont have any money to spend? what will happen then?"
7903,why open ai keeps hiring then?
7905,the real fun begins the moment one of the ai systems tries to unbrick itself. you’ll be literally able to hear an actual not a virtual pin drop in the room. might even steal your crypto to pay its own ransom.
7908,"jobs don't matter, just do what makes you happy. we're nearing the end of humans working, causing a shift in workloads towards technologies taking over. same thing happened during the industrial revolution and people thought there would be nothing to do, yet there still is much to be done."
7911,ai art is a joke though. there's nothing creative about it.
7916,still kinda feel like shes a little overly fixated on this ai thing. kinda starting to get to fear mongering levels.
7918,"i am actually doing a research report based on this very topic! i have not considered the notion that there are no ""safe"" jobs protected from the clutches of ai. i appreciate another perspective."
7923,"so if ai takes all our jobs, who will pay taxes? the companies? they hate paying taxes. so without taxes the goverment doesnt get paid. so this might be an issue."
7924,ai is not creative.
7926,"i'm so happy i made productive decisions about my finances that changed my life forever,hoping to retire next year.. investment should always be on any creative man's heart for success in life"
7930,"i think the last things to go to ai will be anything involving physical tasks like surgeons, plumbers or electricians. it's not that robotics won't be able to do those tasks but it will be much, much longer before their competency will be accepted as sufficient to be done without human intervention or oversight."
7933,i just found your channel last night. thanks!  i have found some very useful information on ai.  well thought out!
7937,makes a video about how ai will replace developers ... shows an ad on how to be a software developer.
7938,hey tina..what is your opinion about ai replacing lawyer or therapist or doctor?
7939,"tech jobs might be in danger but people forgot how to do trade jobs, they don't risk going into medicine or dentistry, and a cannot imagine a machine replacing a pastry chefs and human accuracy catering to fussy demands.
we have tons of factories around the world but there are some jobs that a machine cannot do."
7942,still looking for the linked video about how we can paradoxically harness ai to make ourselves stand out?
7945,acting is the safer job from ai and robotics: when human actors will be replaced by ai robots then will be already in a future like bladerunner and all other jobs will have been already replaced.
7948,", awesome video! very informative..."
7950,"i think people were saying , should’ve gotten a trade , rather than saying getting a blue collar job. very big difference . robots won’t be replacing trades people for a very very long time."
7951,"@tinahuang1 thank you for the video, quite informative. can you please do another one explaining how to embrace these challenges? specially, what happens when the system changes faster than you can learn?, making it really hard to get the amount of experience needed for your next tech job?"
7952,the video id on the link is interesting.
7953,"flipping burgers is not a 'trade'. trades are hvac, car mechanic (extremely technical btw) plumbers, etc.  you said the word 'trades' while showing a pic of a robot flipping burgers. why?"

7979,"the real statement is that business leaders think ""ai did take people's jobs"". business leaders look towards cutting costs and making profits for shareholders. if you are a software engineer building a new platform for your company, then they will stop you and say your idea is not sustainable for ai adoption."

7985,hello mam. mam i am not good at maths so can i learn dsa and actually become good at it

8016,tina you are amazing. today i was sad because as woman i have to show that i can do technical major and seeing you and your knowledge boosted my motivation. i making swe and i want to go for ai master degree. i also think that we should go with the flow and just improve our skills because things will be different in the future but that's okay.

8018,"ai will never replace jobs in ""the trades"".   skip college.  go to vo tech school.  plumbers, carpenters, electricians and hvac specialists are all in high demand and make great money.  there are over 7 million of these job openings available in the us right now!  if you don't want to get dirty...better learn how to use ai to code..."

8040, i am borg sub matrix 36ashitary 81 you will lower your shields and cease your job hunting your data and biological and cultural distinctiveness will be asimulated to serve the greater whole resistance is futile
8052,"imagine in terminator movie, the man from future is telling ""don't worry calculator didn't kill humans"" so ai wont. that is exactly how it looks when people say ""ai wont replace jobs just like how calculators didn't replace mathematicains"" ."

8077,"i think that no matter the job white collar or blue collar take the opportunity to learn ai and all it’s forms. because ai is here to stay, we need to embrace it and learn it, instead of fearing it. that’s just my opinion."
8078,you can't replace bright minds with ai.
8080,"today, tina looks beautiful"

8121,"they sooner replace ai for movie, broadcasters,... ai take our jobs
i suggest, if they want to replace, i refuse to watch ai movies, ai television shows , or use their products .. 

why we have to support their business if they don’t support ours"
8122,"no need to post this propaganda on my tablet,  anyway what kind of humanbeins work force would ask or vote in favor for technology that will make them jobless and irrelevant expendable."
8123,"i think with anything - you can use it for good or for bad purposes, like every other advancement in technology."
8124,everyone in tech creating all this tech savvy and ai and chattpg gonna be jobless and job hopping sadly tech jobs is gonna be 100% ai in the next 2years
8125,i swear to god lol the comment section is bunch of illiterate who also complain about high rent and high house prices . ai has been around ages since we have can vs ai in computer games . no it won’t replace any job. is just a tool . stop overreacting . poor bogans . stfu noobs

8143,i'm just wondering what would happen and a burden if ai can possible take the jobs of barista in the future where they can automatically produce what customer wants
8145,"i am taking a course on chat gpt that is only a few months old. the instructor was showing the limitation of using it. given the example, i gave chat gpt the same input and it provided me the correct answer. it is improving as we speak and many remain ignorant since they can't visualize the progress."
8148,"interesting how companies seek a.i. to only replace low level employees, but i say let's develop it to replace the ceo's."
8149,"this is what i love about a.i.  you can automate/replace your average $25,000/yr barista but the machine will cost you $100,000+ and a technician to maintain the machine for another $50,000/yr (approx).  however, lawyers, writers, accountants, architects, engineers, managers, doctors, ect. can all be replaced with a $3000 pc each."
8150,"i asked this in other comments sections and i can’t seem to get an answer. for the jobs that ai will supposedly create, what jobs exactly will ai create in this ai revolution? and prompt engineering doesn’t count"
8160,"the company with which i work as a ""partner"" has decided to implement ai and although they say ""it will be a sea of new opportunities"" it is evident that all the artists of the company will be replaced, i feel sad, angry, shocked, maybe hopeful but i am afraid. i am truly afraid of the uncertainty of how i will be able to support my family"
8161,"i work with openai and chatgpt models, it’s mostly improving applications rather than replacing jobs. seems more about productivity improvement and making more money w/ it. i’m smart with ai though."
8166,i know for sure ai can't take my job coz i am crisis counselor and people need real person to support in the time of crisis.
8171,"those that wait, get ate."
8172,cnbc your news coverages/ short documentaries are dope af! thank you!
8174,not if it can't pleasure chinese business men in the back of snooker clubs as well me!!!!
8175,i would happily take vacations throughout the year instead of a boring job
8177,take it quicker!!!! release me from my pain!
8180,a good key takeaway is that we have to know how to wield this tool otherwise we'll just lose our job to someone else who does
8183,this will not end well! can we please ceaseai -gpt? or at least consider pausingai?
8184,"ai will advance the human mind to the point where we can finally be one of those other “type (number) civilizations”...itll heavily ramp up our technological capabilities.  booo yaaaaa, forget everything you know people!  soon will we be making new discoveries to work with "
8185,i love that i am starting my senior year of college and ai is starting to advance so rapidly that the industry i am trying to break into will maybe get automated
8186,i know of a company that fired a whole lot of their writers in my country and went with ai generated web content. they stayed with all of their editors and enhanced their seo team.
8190,humans are the only beings that can threaten itself we are amazing.
8191,"ai can copy skilled peoples work hence we should take down magnificent content from internet and ai will vanish.
it does not interpret law and can only present related content put online by authorities.
ai is not human and can never replace actual work.
main it lacks emotions."
8192,is the guy at 7:30 talks about thought policing? i'll have my dangerous thoughts to myself without your or anybody else's supervision thank you.
8193,i think chatgpt will make most white collar jobs obsolete faster compared to blue collar jobs until a robot can be operated under chatgpt intelligence
8196,will autogpt take your job? ai headlines change way too fast
8197,the guy with the fancy mustache looks like he came straight out of borderlands.
8200,those in control feel threatened by granting the public access to ai technology.
8201,"nobody's job is being ""stolen"".  their hours of boring chores are being freed by ai.  change the perspective!"
8202,"i totally disagree that there will be a new segment of jobs available with the rise of ai. we have had agricultural, industrial and technoligical revolutions. there is nothing beyond this. this is entering late stage capitalism and it will not be pretty."
8204,"we are creating an entity capable of imitating what we do, but all at the same time and a thousand times faster. the argument of new works seems to me to be aggressively naive."
8209,"oh i'm waiting patiently.... there's still businesses and/or tax authorities that require printed checks  as a form of payment. once it becomes completely eradicated, then that's when i'll consider giving up my job to chatgpt "
8210,"when man invented the wheel, many tasks that required multiple humans could all of a sudden be completed with far fewer people. we simply adapted to the new world. ai will change the way we work and help humanity evolve further. those losing their jobs are not at risk. they will simply adapt."
8211,"ai should take over the media, as a myanmar citizen i found out so much biased news especially from western media and moderation of western social media platforms. they would side with even groups that are killing and bombing civillians but in the name of democracy & so called freedom. ai wouldn't side with these unless programed to specifically."
8212,"yes, and if there are ""new"" jobs eventually they will be taken over as well, all the ai needs is to collect information about it, it is inevitable. the only ""jobs"" that ai can't takeover are prostitution, hospitality and professional athletes "
8214,"comparing ai to our transition away from an agricultural economy is a bad comparison because that took years/decades. ai will replace jobs at a faster rate than we can retrain workers for other jobs. not to mention it will eventually learn to do the jobs people retained for. the problem will not only come fast, it will also be self-compounding."
8219,"ai doesn’t consume, humans do so from a economic standpoint ai can’t help only hurt. if employers replace humans with ai it will be less consumption because ai doesn’t eat, buy cars, buy homes etc. good luck human race."
8220,"as a person who study in ai, right now ai is the fastest growing platform, the way its going it is the next industrial revolution. as the industrial revolution made life easier, ai will also do that, but it will also change the way humans work too. but agi will still be decades from now, jobs will change."
8222,ai has huge potential in the automation of manufacturing space.
8223,ai will not take human jobs why because ai learn from humans gather data from humans and ai is a tool for humans to make job more efficient
8225,it will fail!!!!!!
8228,ai isn’t the same as other “new”tech in the past. to assume they’re the same shows their “experts” don’t have a clue that they are talking about.
8235,"i love chatgpt, i'm in it and very technical (have a math degree and use to work for spacex). however i have dyslexia so, i hate writing emails and have a lot of spelling errors. ever since chatgpt, i have the system always spell check my emails and it makes me look very sophisticated and professional, i love it!"
8239,i welcome our robot overlords.
8240,disney character panties are the most cutest and comfortable kind of panties to wear hgca
8241,"in the future, you don't even need to go to school because the ai will go to school for you."
8242,i’m an educator and i get incredibly nervous when i hear a student bring up how they used chat-gpt to help them solve their problems.
8244,"any job that can be done at home, so called remote “work” can be gone now. will certainly be gone in 5 years."
8245,"chatgpt won't take over your job, but it will be taken over by the person using ai. "
8246,just launch the emp and we all good.
8254,we absolutely need governments to intervene and slow or pause this wave of ai until we get our act together. it is a pandora's box at this point and we have no idea what we're doing to society.
8258,"while i think the short term effects of ai is very overblown by the mainstream media, as time goes on it just shows how much andrew yang was in sync with the problems of society and he should have won the 2020 election"
8267,"chat gpt can take my job but it will never take away my girlfriend cause she don't exist ,take that ai"
8270,"guys!!!! think of this...if ai really take over the economy then people will lost their job, when people lost their job they can afford the product that the company makes which make the whole economy break....so i think that ai wouldn't replace our job completely. but for part time job they might.... anyway just my opinion."
8272,and the rise of the machines continues....
8275,"since i’m in the artistic field, thanks for creating some thing that’s going to put me out of business. i really appreciate that after working my whole life to build this business."
8282,can’t wait till ai replaces everyone at cnbc
8284,"chatgpt only works with the main world languages. 
pictorial languages like chinese require a secondary but different development.
also, the ""generative ai"" is only a nominal description. the ai cant generate anything on its own, but can only recombine words and images that have already been written or drawn..."
8288,"you should rather address the massive under reporting and burying of black on white attacks across the west in local news, while fawning over the opposite. but that's a certain cosmopolitan elite deliberately doing that, while flooding the west with mass migration, rather than chat gpt"
8289,"people tell gpt chat that without electricity can do   
gpt boot need to hear we are going to destroy ai "
8290,ai will take our jobs but for who ai would do the job ?
8292,"the short answer is yes.
however, many people may be hesitant to admit this due to embarrassment or a lack of understanding about how rapidly ai is advancing and will continue to do so in the coming years."
8296,i guess the movie irobot was telling the truth damn machines are trying to take over.
8298,"these ""will chatgpt take our jobs"" articles/content are gettick so damn hacky. come up with a new take. unless...this was written by ai."
8299,"one of the best examples of automation is with toll booths. humans are too inefficient with this and we always have backed lines from toll gates. now with automation, i don't see backed up lines anymore.we shouldn't justify this type of work inconvenience.."
8301,full time vacation travel while a.i. does all the hard work.....sweet!.....sign me up!!
8302,"oh no, here comes the boomers and dinosaurs. hindering humanity's progress once again! this is literally why we are held back from reaching our peak development."
8303,my finance professor has said multiple times that ai will never take finance jobs. why? because anyone can crunch numbers but ai doesn’t have that human judgment that you need when making financial decisions aside from just numbers
8306,"if ai wants my job, it can have it. but i doubt that will happen."
8308,always with the identity politics always. cnbc trying to call ai misogynistic. wow big leap there.
8309,"well, i can certainly handle a lot of tasks, but i'm not sure i'm ready for a career change just yet! besides, i don't think i could match your unique set of skills and personality. so, don't worry, your job is safe with you (for now, at least!).


answered by chatgpt"
8312,"vocational schools are better choice for most.   good living wages with manual repair like plumbing, electrical and carpentry are all good professions.  always in demand."
8314,false content and bias can be mitigates by ai as well. an ai that checks data for accuracy and root origin.
8315,how do i know this video wasn’t created by ai to trick me into believing in the dangers of ai?
8318,"i can't wait to see the teachers who told me to stay in school, out of a career. coming to me for a labor position because they have no experience lol"
8321,just let ai do all the work already and give us universal basic income.
8322,wow 
8324,wait... you guys have jobs?? ( o.o)
