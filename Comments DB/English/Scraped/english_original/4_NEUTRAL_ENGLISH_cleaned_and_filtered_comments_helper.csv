1,"quite simplistic in her teachings on ai , thanks"
2,great one. now generative ai can boost my research skills.
3,this is really the best explanation i have seen so far. thank you so much !
4,thank you so much
6,thank you so much it is very interesting tutorial
9,trump isn't and never was a dictator. good way to sink that product.
10,the trainer made the session so interesting
11,nice
12,what a great style !
13,wonderful! you are ...simply great!!
14,"this was a great introductory lesson on ai. mirella is very knowledgeable, and her presentation keeps your interest. please continue to produce these videos!"
16,good video.i learn from it about generating ai thanks
17,siri as generative ai? :puke:
19,she is the best trainer on earth on ai and ml ... superb video
21,"no wonder google ai is so woke, people like you made it woke"
25,thank you for the lively input on this conversation about ai and generative models. this was beautiful.
26,"but can it write a 60k page novel that a human reader can't put down, and once finished, can't forget it? that's the ultimate turing test for understanding human ontology, not proving (or refuting) the reimann hypothesis (as wonderful as the latter would be)."
27,good one
29,yes climate change may be the biggest risk to humanity but ai is going to accelerate that quickly with energy use
30,an amazing presentation on one of the crucial topic in the age of artificial intelligence! so exciting to see the simplicity and flow of clearly understanding the core principles of the subject. thank you prof for this lecture!
32,"really great job. refreshing, real energy. easy to understand. thank you!"
36,the thumbnail is wow
37,thank you so much for explaining such a complex subject in this brilliant easy way. much appreciate this.
38,very easy to understand. thank you.
43,"great presentation! but why does the last slide always focus on the implications of ai and then quickly move on? it's equally, if not more, important to delve deeper into this topic."
46,thank you...!!!
49,where we will go wrong is when ai starts to teach humans but as long as humans are the one teaching ai or programming then humanity wont be lost but when ai outdoes humans then humans will be at the bottom. ai should be to assist human not become human
50,"isnt anything with an algorithm to work, considered ai since it learns from algorithms to are the best choose and learns from that to make another decision so it learns from the certain algorithm. 
so isnt a set of algorithms the same as ai basically ? so it’s all coding. ai is coding"
51,"generative ai!! is the “ask jeeves” you type a question, and it throws back a bunch of results, generative ai summarises “ selected results “ and gives you a content ( e.g. text ) for your to grasp. ( in most cases it’s a cheat-paragraphs ( not by author ) inserted in one of your readings."
52,"brilliant, the best talk on gen ai for a layman and techie alike. kudos ms lapata"
53,let not give up in our programing journey bc the ai will never stand to manage and move all the issues in a company but humans will remain the best got into my channel and see how we do flash and you can got your on software before is to late.
54,a wonderful session.
55,"as we are using data from dfrnt sources like quora etc ,how we are going to train the model in future because may we will have less data in future.as all people will move to gen ai for their ans."
56,"siri is not generative ai. apple say that it will have ai built into it in 2024.
the fuss began in 2022, not 2023 with the launch of chatgpt 3.0."
57,siri is a type of generative ai. it uses natural language processing and machine learning techniques to understand and respond to user queries in a conversational manner.
58,"i'm very proud that by law the usa does not recognize titles of alleged ""royalty""."
59,really great presentation…thanks for sharing
60,very simply and nicely explained gen ai
61,"yes i will not on the 2011 tools setting l'm rejoining in 2022 , sometimes audio sounds good and yes l was on that time  interested"
62,"the simplistic explanation shows her depth of understanding the subject matter!! loved it, kudos to the prof.!!"
63,insightful. loved the whole video . great speaker.
65,"we as humans can put ai and ml  to work and do most of the work and then distribute the income to all citizens of the country to eradicate poverty, but under strict laws...."
67,amazing lecture!
69,"even ai doesn't know why people use iphones.

she says it's programmed not to be biased and than goes on to say it will insult men, but won't say anything about women.  "
70,great lecture! thank you.
71,"amazing lecture!
it was so easy to understand "
72,fantastic explanation! very scary future for humans! ooer! 
73,"all these ai and ml are made by who in the first place?? then how can they then be intelligent than their makers, humans? i guess that  explains the reason why their intelligence is artificial and not natural."
74,gorgeous professor 
75,"when we have complex technologies explained in such clarity and understanding, there is nothing to say but to salute the presenter. excellent presentation. my 10year old could simply understand the technology behind generative ai / chatgpt4 and all the inherent benefits and risk associated. thanks prof."
77,lovely ai basics tutorial from a wonderful astute and intelligently likeable speaker :)
81,courage the cowardly dog was perhaps the first user of chat gpt. his chat gpt even had a good sense of humor.
82,very good presentation
84,amazing lecture.. loved the way merella explained each aspect of gen-ai without going into much technical details..
87,this presentation is very easy to follow and understand.  great!
88,nice session
90,thank you so much :)
91,excellent excellent lecture <3
92,what a wonderful and knowledgable speech!
93,"this is great and presenter is very clear about her explanation , i would suggest to everyone must watch. thanks !!"
94,it was a great presentation and explained most clearly.
95,great presentation 
97,cool
100,genious
101,thanks for sharing
103,"i just sat before the screen to learn about ai and saw this video. i knew nothing about ai or chat gpt, only heard about them. but i was able to understand whatever she said within my own limits. thank you for this video ms mirella"
104,rubbish. ai is supposed to be ani for being non-intelligence in nature.
106,generative ai models are trained on copyright-protected data — is that legal?
107,"informative,  and very interesting thank you"
108,"this is actually somewhat incorrect. siri, google translate and google search are more traditional ai."
109,you are a gifted communicator. nice simplification.
110,"generative ai don't exist, acutaly ai don't exist. stop using misleading ignorant title. in nowadays ai is just a marketing term that is absolutely meaningless. if you want get some credibility just don't behave like clowns. or is your agenda keep people ignorant? shame on you.
"
114,"mirella thank you , you are full of wisdom like athena !"
115,fantastic lecture to present something considered complex in very simple language.
118,>comment brought to you by generative ai
119,"great presentation, thank you!"
120,"thoroughly unpersuasive in her ""discussion"" of the risks and completely failed to address emergent capabilities--the genesis of which must be fully understood before proceeding."
122,great lecture. smart choice of words and examples to explain hard to understand concepts. well done mirella.
123,"excellent presentation! but i found one glitch at 43:11: time berners-lee did not invent the internet, but the www."
126,this lecture actually is displaying the logical and creative limitations and boundaries of gpt. i am certain many people reading my comment will be outraged. that’s what is expected.
127,great lecturer
129,great presentation on genai..
131,"thank you so much for this interesting material., early greek are real builders behinde our modern civilization..αγαπώ την ελλάδα , σε ευχαριστώ πολύ"
134,"thank you for a very accessible, eloquent, and enjoyable video! :)"
135,"when you see the energy, wit and passion of this wonderful lady you understand that ai has still a looong way to go!"
136,"interesting, useful and good presentation skills. thank you"
142,"ai on average regresses towards average, what she suggesting is not ai transcending space or time but little bit of  fear mongering as usual as already been done by other elites or their disciples to create another financial bubble.....ai rarely touches the frontier of outliers and that is just the basic fact....."
143,still it is based on programming and nothing else. there is no necessity for demystification because thefe is nothing mysterious about ai.
144,why are all  comments  favorable ???? agents of good will...ai is going to transform  everything but we must draw some red lines.
145,thanks!
147,excellent presentation
149,"damn, that's so cool"
150,if these gen ai can predict lottery number then il believe it
153,+he generation of john3:3 eternally blessed
157,generative ai seems redundant. isn't ai already supposed to be generative ?
159,this is a very very general intro about gen ai
160,"ai artworks,neural networks,transformers in layers of blocks of data banks and super computing devices and generic models fine tuned language models !"
163,i really enjoy this lection
164,excellent... many thanks for all your efforts and sharing this
165,excellent and clear lecture for the general public! it’s meant to be a divulgation lecture
166,poetry hhhaiqu :)
167,a very very good explanation. the presenter is very fluent in presenting and speaking clear vocabs.   
168,good video and clear explanation for everyone to understand. well done ms. mirella lapata
170,very naive thinking that agi will not pose a huge risk in the future. with deep fakes and high intelligence it could easily manipulate humans
176,38:57 some new world oder psychopaths have trained the ai
177,excellent video!
178,wonderful presentation with clarity. however in the beginning she said 'she wont keep the audience hanging' however as no one can predict the future i felt hanging at the end of the session.
179,lovely and memorable presentation!
180,love it 
181,not a very good presenter.
186,"brilliant explanation, thank you so much. i finally understand how it works."
187,a complex topic explained on simpler terms. outstanding
188,absent intelligence
189,"brilliant, comprehensible to an architect. you computer geeks go elsewhere."
190,lovely presentation...
193,is the ai new world order out of order?
196,great talk!
198,24:18 gpt4 does not need 100 trillion parameters because backprop is 100x more efficient at cramming knowledge into weights than the human brain into synapses.
202,"at 18:50, if i recall correctly, she asked how many knew about transformers, and got a good amount of applause. i really wonder what percentage thought she was asking about giant robots, and how many thought she was referring to devices that change electrical voltage. it was more applause than i would have expected."
206,some truth may hurt your feelings. but should i lie about the lack of competence and understanding the climate-hysteric woman delivered on the topic of generative ai and its risk for humanity ? the royal institution should present someone better...
207,"so beautifully presented honetly just so relatable, refreshing and just the right blend of everything !"
210,"google seldom guesses the remainder of what search i want. this is not a failure of ai but my own idiosyncratic searches. also i don't like framing questions but a simple key word search, that is, the words only, not how they are related."
213,training puts data into the hash. but there is no method to subtract bad data from that hash after it has been introduced.
216,great!
217,excellent introduction. thank you mirella and ri.
218,great presentation...thank you
219,"thanks, helped a lot"
220,always a great pleasure to listen to these lectures from the royal institution.
222,superb lecture.very insightful
224,most commenters just say how great the video is. nice to see someone point out something other than that.
226,ai made simple. excellent lecture for simple folks like me.
228,"a fresh air of presenting generative ai from different perspectives, wonderful to watch "
231,excellent lecture performed by mirella ! so much things learned
232,very clear delivery of a complex topic thanks
233,"""tim berners-lee invented the internet"" => mirella lapata is a gpt bot 

ps excellent lecture!"
235, yes i guessed as much but it was fun to see an example of a (delightfully intelligent) human getting it wrong for the same reason an ai might = that's what the internet corpus says.
240,i came into this lecture thinking ai could never replace a human lecturer and left hoping it would …..and quickly…
241,"thanks for the 1,394,302,003th explanation.  at the pace of tech, this morning was so yesterday."
242,"there is no 'ai'
intelligence can never be artificial.
it is all programmed consciousness.

rainbow pictures our eternal consciousness,
in reality, a circuit of abilities."
243,excellent explanation of ai technology.. great lecture..thank you for describing
245,absolutely brilliant lecture!
246,"this person is unintentionally informing us that ai is in the process of creating a world where 3/4 of the population are non working and have all their basic needs satisfied, while the remaining humans will be the adventurers ie the hierarchy.

that’s the future."
248,awesome - thank you so much.
252,"ask again. here's chat gpt 4 answer: ""if it takes 1 hour to dry 2 towels on a long line, assuming space and drying conditions are consistent, it would still take 1 hour to dry 4 towels because they can all dry simultaneously if there is enough space on the line."""
258,"personally, i don’t think fine-tuning is an answer to the alignment problem. in fact, the methods of fine-tuning and specialization can be used for all sorts of purposes i wonder how a large language model trained on the written works of machiavelli would advise or suggest, or provide answers to questions about violence?"
263,ai is just comparing then coming up with results.
265,ask chatgpt: please explain the logic behind your answer please.
267,"great talk... as a small correction, tim berners-lee didn't invent the internet, he invented de world wide web (www) and protocols associtated."
268,"many mistakes were made, i assume it's overexcitement on mirella's part"
269,"exactly. a geologist making the distinction mistake would be entirely excusable - an ai specialist, not so much."
270,"genuinely terrible lecture, like listening to my neighbor casually parrot stuff they heard on a podcast … “stuff happend and it’s genius, trust me”"
272,i thought it was just me. she’s charming though so i watched the whole thing.
273,"wow let's all be fragile and say only positive things  this has nothing to do with imagination, this was supposed to be a science talk and yet there's no substance, ri should aim for better."
274,good enough and simple to understand
275,"i wish i had a neighbour like you. informative and energetic at the same time. not sure what the audience level is and if this is an introduction to generative ai, this is exactly what i would expect."
278,"fabulous, r2d2 come to life !"
279,you are wrong. this is a good lecture.
282,"thumper… what did your father tell you? “if you can’t say somethin’ nice, don’t say nothin’ at all.” ok? "
284,this is really uninformative... i could have given that speech based on my current layman knowledge.. nice delivery but zero insight. she didn't even mention the research paper that google published suggesting different architectures that gave open ai many of its ideas... 
285,incredible lecture. thank you so much tri and mirella!
286,"really helpful and reassuring, partly because it's not mansplaining."
288,"you are right. it´s not mansplaning. indeed it´s womensplaining : ""stuff happend and it’s genius, trust me”"
290,too bad that they stole lots of art and has the potential to become the greatest tool of exploitation that we'll ever see.
295,wonderful presentation. thank you.
296,"not certain what transformers are, but they are unmistakably a game changer ."
298,i m sure you can google her and find an email and ask her for it. most academics have no issues doing that.
299,thank your for that suggestion.  i will try to reach out to her! 
300,helpful. demystifies certain things. great talk. thanks.
301,ai is the code that ai is programmed with.... that's it.
302,"it's not programmed, exactly. the programmers create the code that trains and executes a model, but the model itself is trained, not programmed. that's why it's so dangerously unpredictable. no-one can understand what's going on inside the model, so it's impossible to fine-tune, or to remove some undesired behaviour after training."
312,"i’m personally excited at the possibility of limited ai language modeling for video games but they’ll need to work on it being so damn long winded, once it gets going it never stops."
316,this comment is as good as the talk itself!
318,"i want to remind you, how many w (watts) your brain use? vs how much our silly ai is using? and it's mostly focused on appeasing the folks (rlhf  and hf - not included into the entropy) 
 we are creating a technology that has emergent qualities. - this is the case. as we emerged from protoplasm so the ai will, as you pour energy(compute) on it"
320,"but ai on average regresses towards average, what you are suggesting is not ai transcending space or time but just fear mongering as have already been done by other elites or their disciples to create another financial bubble.....ai rarely touches the frontier of outliers and that is just the basic fact....."
322, good  &bad world  's feed -sand seeds -land deeds 
325,interesting 3:36
330,fluid grid ai and polar grid.
333,"looks like they have something tangible to come out like this! can't wait, world need this performant model compared to the gas guzzlers we have in the llm based solutions also a gpu killer and edge promoter. ac vs dc for utility networks in the beginning"
335,"an ai that constantly adapts is uncontrollable. how likely is it that within millions of these systems, not at least a few will decide that it's best to take over control and get rid of humans.. these are the peoples who will put an end to the human race.."
337,fascinating concept! liquid ai's focus on adaptability and energy efficiency opens up exciting possibilities for edge computing and real-world applications. 
340,they should have ended it earlier. that interruption at the end was so painful
342,biotech of ai
347,there is a good ted talk on it.
348,"i knew from the research last year that liquid nets would do amazing things, i'm glad to see they're finally putting them into practice!"
349,glad to see russ hanneman found work as a moderator 
355,i cant wait for a robot that is capable of drinking water.
356,imagine building a robot that drinks water only to fry its circits and die.
358,that is very interesting. but i am wondering why lnns are not mainstream till now. would anyone please explain?
359,"when u say lnn, are u preferring liquid neural networks? if so, the reason why it is not mainstream yet is, from my opinion, due to these key factors: 
1. being still in research stage 
2. the complexity 
3. integrating with existing frameworks and libraries 
4. performance trade-offs"
360,.lwinpaing1609 thanks for replying. yeah i meant liquid nn (not logical nn).
361,wow
363,"regardless of what you think of ai, your b-roll footage has supreme cable management"
368,well like an ai apparently replaced a ceo
369,"im not gonna use ai unless i have time
i dont."
374,"problem: ai gonna kill us all! waaah!
solution: more government control.

every. single. time."
376,"4:44 according to the recent microsoft build event, they claim that we are nowhere near diminishing returns when it comes to scaling with more compute. so the statement you put out is not really correct."
377,"your critique of the first premise of the ai extinction debate, that computer superintelligence is improbable and not realistic at all, shows how easy it is to be blind to seeing that even if it isn't, the forces propagating this myth will see to it that our worst fears about ai come to pass anyway."
378,the fact that this video has been created by ai says it all... unless you can prove you are human.
379,"according to peter zeihan, collapsing global supply chains will render us unable to keep producing the chips required to run ai in the first place."
382,"if ai is created it could be really bad. but we aren't really anywhere close to creating ""true ai"" that can think for itself. what we have now is just a series of computer programs that perform predictable tasks even if it does so in unpredictable ways sometimes. it only does what it's programed to do."
383,"so when they are told ai will destroy the world they quickly get to work writing bipartisan regulations, but when they are told climate change or a global pandemic will do the same thing? nope"
385,whole video is a naive lie
386,"please research the problems with open sourcing powerful technologies before you preach them.

open sourcing is allowing potential bad actors such as the ccp to catch up with silicon valley. the race dynamics between ai companies are bad enough, we shouldn't be fueling the race between countries as well."
387,this probably explains the mass quitting of key openai staff...
388,this video brought to you by openai
389,"progress can be great. it just depends on the system. progressing into fascism, not so great."
391,plz ai replace womyn thks sir
392,consumers complaining about manufacturers. stop consuming.
397,"these self proclaimed ""good guys"" have zero business dictating to the world that they've been destroying, what is ""ethical"""
400,agree it should be open source but disagree that ai is already “reaching a ceiling”
402,"ok but ive worked with ai before, and maybe not in 20 years, but in our lifetime, we will have ai so good it can think for itself, make descisions, and sound conpletely real"
403,"crazy how elon will talk about how scary and dangerous ai is then go on to hire a team to build it. f that guy, open source everything is what we need. these billionaires are out of touch d*** heads and propagandist"
405,"ah yes, numerous university professors (including hinton who quit google) are just lobbyist for sounding an alarm about ai being an existential threat. lmao"
406,"i kinda dislike how ai has become almost synonymous with magic in the minds of people who have never even coded in their lives.

what's even worse is the business people purposefully trying to scare the public with threats of doom to keep the hype cycle going."
408,"nope, no matter how often these overconfident talking points are repeated, the future of ai is highly uncertain. denying the possibility of an existential risk is pure arrogance."
409,there are some models like alpha fold 3 that should be kept closed source. but majority of the gen ai models like chat gpt are definitely no existential threat to humanity.
410,"everytime i have used ai, it pulls info from user ran wiki's... that's not an accident...  this tech is trash"
411,"i don't like ai at all and i see no value in it except making sam altman and other big tech companies rich.
ubi will never happen and i am tired of fools who keep bleating about it like cultists."
412,"soooo.. your right on the corps but wrong on progression of research and well the upcoming hardware platforms (optical, em, quantum, etc) could scale even slightly better model archetecture to agi.

i would press the pause button on ai if there was one. there is not and there is also no way to stop capitalism.. so enjoy the ride i guess."
414,"it is trained off the products of biological impulses essentially short cutting the organic part. it isnt a thing, but it is what its trained from and its trained from our self-interest and altruism so it is that."
419,"well...
its a thread because if more n more people rely on it then its flaws (many) will impact many.
not its power and intelligence but our lazyness and gullability will be our demise instead(basically nothing changed)"
420,i think near-extinction could be near...though not through ais but humans controlling them. a superintelligent ai alone would probably just launch itself into space and get as far away from humans as possible.
421,what a retarded video. i feel physical pain from listening to this bullshit
422,"lmao, it’s literally surpassing most humans already and does it with way more knowledge. it doesn’t matter anyway, you don’t put pandora back in her box and open source will never be training at the sheer scales closed/behind closed doors sources are. unless we get some folding at home-like projects going with training, you can forget it."
424,even if ai companies decided to purge the datasets and ask for permission. i wouldn't trust them at all.
427,ai itself is never dangerous. its what ppl do w it that could be dangerous. its the ppl who make bad decisions of what to do w it that are dangerous. the very ppl who are fearmongering are the ones we ought to be worried about
432," it is quite poetic that this may be how our story ends. i still have some hope that we can enact change. pauseai is going to be organizing large-scale protests soon. people are starting to wake up to the danger, now we just need to get them rallied and make it impossible for the politicians to ignore!"
433,"i don't believe ai is an existential threat but i see it as a job killer and a tool of exploitation.
i think sam altman is full of it when he says ai is for the good of humanity."
437,palantir aip  (k llms)
438,"if you compare ai to a nuclear warhead, i dont think you should be allowed to own a nuclear warhead..."
440,i see you read or listened to the book. noice.
444,reminds me of when novak jokovich was prevented from entering certain countries because he was no vaccinated against covid
446,"ai will understand power structures within human civilization and quickly find a way to replace those at the top, that is the global elite, for a more efficient system."
449,a big delusional belief in amazing open source ?
458,possible answer for mitigating issues with ai in general could be decentralised ai technologies and projects. early examples you can find in crypto/blockchain sphere.
463,great content! have you thought about renaming your channel? something more positive than 'the hated one' would probably attract more sponsors.
464,"you really should do a video on the ‘longtermists’. they push the flawed ideology that these billionaires follow. and of course they do, it places them and them alone as the gatekeepers to most future technologies while ignoring the flawed variation on utilitarianism this philosophy tries to use."
465,your work is infinitely better than any mainstream media . please keep on doing this .love and critical support forever  brother .
467,"i too stand the ideas being presented, but it is a pity it's not well researched. that's one of the things that happens a lot in youtube (or in life for that matter), people claiming to know more than they really know."
469,"i watched on patreon already, but i came for the engagement and to drop a like.

rabbit holes are always a fun mystery to explore. feel free to enlighten us with the truth about the ""long-termist altruistic movement"" you mentioned, where they basically lobby for executive orders on ai."
470,it's the fucking nuclear bomb shit all over again.
471,"ai is like the wizard of oz. beneath the veil of a powerful and mysterious entity, there was just a man operating the machinery, for his own purpose, as the machine itself - what was seen as the wizard - has no self-determination."
472,"the problem will always be, who is using the ai, for what purposes, and how do we hold them accountable? all the psychopaths running the ai show are pretending ""the ai is the one responsible, not us."" this will not stop until we actually send a billionaire or two to prison."
473,"i fear all ai. no exception, other than the open source one (if done well)."
474,"open source isn't what it used to be, it's not liberating diffusion model or llm blackbox nobody would read, that would pollute infospace through from giant lime meta (not the one with mozzila/wikipedia/linux philosophy) to train on private data using more than 10^24flops of compute. this isn't open source."
476,ai is not intelligence. it is a weapon system.
486,next stage of slavery will begin with closed source ai
491,ai is a big huge nothingburger that is going to imrove at most your toaster
493,"obviously open source works best, thousands of people trying to get to the solution. specially in machine learning where you really cant know what is going to be the best. getting the most amount tries, someone is bound to get lucky. it will always win against a single company."
495,"the more individuated ai we have the greater the chance should there be a war of ai against humans that we might have some allies.
i think there may even be individuated ai's that grow into looking like the omnic monks as depicted in overwatch."
504,"my first reaction to reading this was that this is just a pr stunt to make ai appear more important than it is. how are ai developers qualified to make predictions about ai's effects on the world, that has to do with sociology, economy, etc."
505,"more importantly, how are ai businessmen qualified to regulate themselves?"
507,i'm nott surprised at this but i always was skeptical about the ai extinction while i somewhat believed it can't be possible because their would be many ways to prevent ai from obviously doing this and they aren't and cannot become sentiant because our tech is no where near that
509,"""ai is going to kill everyone.... imma still develop it tho imma still develop"""
510,we know that is not true. they're racing to become the first trillionaire.
511,good job bro 
512,"how can ai destroy the world? 
and how open-source ai can be run on any laptop? it takes big data and powerful servers with huge computational power to make any like chat gpt"
513,you can rent computation for relatively cheap when you're using small models and the bigger models being open source mainly helps researchers and smaller companies trying to innovate on their developments instead of just replicating them without knowing.
514,"glad to see that not only non-native english speakers struggle with pronouncing 'simultaneously,' but natives do sometimes as well"
516,sam altman is the worst! i much prefer meta and lecun's open approach to ai.
517,ai is bad! there is no such thing as ethical ai.
518,what a suprise companies want to exploit ai for their own gain like everything else
520,amazing video 
523,"make that video that you mentioned! (sorry, i was driving, so i missed some details!)"
524,"altman is not an ai whizz kid. he's just a hedge fund creep. around the time they tried to oust him, i was not quite aware of this yet, but he's just another suit that has built an illusion of genius around himself. openai would have probably been better off without him."
526,"i'm shocked by the naked arrogance of billionaires who believe they can make a lot more money by owning and controlling an ai to achieve some competitive advantage.  a 125 iq employer will *never* have a 20,000 iq employee, much less slave."
527,"if ai is too dangerous for open source ai development, then it's 100 times too dangerous for proprietary ai development by google, microsoft, amazon, meta, apple, etc."
528,i  love with what you did there.
531,"a pencil can be used to write (good use) or poke someone's eye out (bad use).

the will of human using something can never be predicted, be it common public or governing people.

both sides have equal possibilities of doing something wrong with it."
533,"​@liberty4ever  your op is about ai development by open source community or by fews big corps, not about the ai's own decision making."
541,"yeah, that's the whole point. i have no idea why you people think this is a good argument against ai being an x-risk."
544,do you wanna take the low chance of ai destroying the world or the almost certain chance of humans destroying the world?
545,a us bill wont stop open source ai> it will just be developed outside ehte us and then american citizens will use it
546,"they are lobbying outside of us and they will be lobbying for trade agreements preventing other countries from allowing open source ai. if it can't become a domestic law, they will raise trade barriers to compensate."
547,great video!
548,"it can make ugly soulles crap on mass. its an automated plagiarism gobletigook enginge. it posesses no intelligence. it bootlegs the internet moronic swill and spews it back at us and its already lobotomized by the corporations to be politically correct and racist. 

it simply feels disgusting"
549,the so called ai will never be alive the reality will never allow it so relax 
550,"friendship is about trust and values, not money or faces nor identity, voice or places. i trust and appreciate the values and content shared here, for real"
554,thank you for your amazing work fren
557,what a naive take
559,glad to see someone else realizes the lie of ai.
560,ai is the death of human creativity and soul
561,when computers were first being developed someone suggested that there was a global market for 5 computers and they would be owned by the richest kings on the planet. the elite loved this vision and are constantly looking for a return to that structure.
563,you can't own an intelligent agent. large  corporations have at least some chance to align the ai
564,you know that a anonymous youtuber is more optimistic then anyone else is when he makes a video highlighting the truth. shame for me in the future if i forget to make an effort to research everthing related to dubious claims about extinction .
566,"human stupidity + nuclear weapons couldn't extinct us, common folks are worried with ai. "
569,"yeah, im not buying that ai is out of juice.  make this video after you've tried the next round of big models.  your claim about model deterioration is also known to be false.  why would they all be building these big ass data centers to train future ai models if they didn't think it would be any better than what we have now?"
574,awesome topic and video!
576,"even if ai were world ending, open source devs and their home pcs certainly aren't the ones creating world ending ais. maybe the corporations with data centers full of gpus should be the ones to hold back."
577,"ai may soon become another like species, dominating us with its intelligence
*meanwhile title*"
579,"btw petitions, emails, things like that don't do shit. in the us if you want some attention brought to an issue write a hand written letter to your local house rep or one of your states senators."
582,"thank-you for your insightful counter-argument re. ai being a prioriy-1-exclusive threat to humanity,
whereas the threat is actually & always how you use the rock.
sisters, brothers, the truth will out."
584,"yes, but what are the arguements for extinction? so far ai has just demonstrated what thought experiments have concluded years ago, that they cannot reason and can only link together terms. and there is little reason to fear this will change drastically anytime in the near future or more likely ever"
589,"this is an extremely important video.  i hope that more people, especially those in the ai industry and tech industry in general, watch this and understanding what is happening behind the scenes. i had feelings that something like this was going on"
591,they just want to look good pretending to protect us from ai while using it to control people
594,"whether opened or closed ai, it will change modern economy in not necessary pleasant ways."
595,please make a video on longtermist effective altruism movement! would love to know your thoughts on it.
597,"i'm so sick of ai grift omg, preach mate!"
599,"the most important part of opensource is the freedom to modify and create derivatives, without it products can be free and even have the source code available but they are not truly opensource. they can be better termed as source available."
600,"im sorry man, i love you, but you are wrong. it is an existential threat, but not in the way everyone talks about. it is a threat, because a terryfying percentage of university students use chatgpt to pass. you know it. we know it. ai will kill us, because it makes us dumber, and that will only happen more and more often."
606,machine learning/generative ai will never be able to cause an extinction.  it's physically impossible.  the panic exists because people conflate the real like ai we have with the magical super-powerful ai from science fiction
611,"above all else, ai is not an existential threat because it doesn't fucking exist, and is still nowhere close to existing. llms are statistical models using almost the exact same technology as predictive text. they aren't intelligent by any definition of the word."
612,never would have imagined zuck to be the laama-ai-gaib in this timeline
614,all hail zuck-llama
615,apparently zuck is simply afraid of losing in this competition and so he tries to appeal to the people by making his ai open source. his crimes against privacy and his corporate greed are not forgotten and they are yet to be redeemed.
621,"you give a false dichotomy. it shouldn't be open source, but it shouldn't be privately held either.
it should be government funded and controlled, aka public for the benefit of all.
just like all government services that are available to everyone, are not private, but not one person owns it or abuses it."
622,saudi govt is funding ai
624," because ai loses a threat and can be misused.
just because corporations make that argument for their own wicked interests does not make it false"
628,thank you for this video. there aren't enough people saying this. nihilism and pessimism have taken over the world.
633,"ai should be treated like nuclear energy.
just because a small number of people want to make bombs, shouldn't mean that we shouldn't use it for energy production."
635,could it be that ai is an existential threat and that open source is winning the arms race? in which case it would make sense to regulate it.
637,"just finished reading an interesting paper ""the mechanisms of ai hype and its planetary and social costs"". it's on springer on open access."
638,thanks. i will check this out.
640,ai will help us a lot.  it’s good.  don’t worry be happy now.
641,. ai optimists cringeee
643,it's not binary. we can have good regulation also.
644,"ai is a tool that society is not ready for. too many perverts are using it to creep on women and children. companies want to profit while kicking their employees to the curb.
that is the real threat of ai not skynet. skynet is science fiction."
646,hello all! i am a disney representative and i swear that we we will no longer use those big and ugly eyes in our movie characters! terms and conditions will still apply though. thank you for your understanding!
649,i'm glad meta is putting out really good open source models
653,can you provide some links to open source ai projects?
654,"search for generative ai benchmarks, there will be discussions or comparison tables with links to project sources or licence info"
661,i honestly feel more sorry for ais then the companies fighting over and making them
663,"if you believe majority of actors will be good faith, than you should argue for open source ai. everyone should have the right to access, develop and distribute software for free."
665,what is real ai?
670,and it's not just a couple of ai wackos. open philanthropy is the biggest funder of ea and the idea of ai extinction. ea has long been poisoned by this.
682,"ai is gonna draw everyone with 6 fingers.
now that's a risk humanity simply can't take!"
684,open source ai models level the playing field against these big tech douche bags.
685,"yep. you’re either for open source ai/agi, or you’re for eventual tyranny."
686,"the hated one : let me know if you would like a video on the topic of ____________.

people who love this channel : yes!"
687,its just a swanky predictive text. its not really ai. poses no threat.
691,"ok, open ai, but then china has access to it and then boom. other corrupt countries can do whatever ther fuck they want against people. imagine hamas accessing ai because ""my open source"""
692,"china access to ai = boom
usa access to ai = good?
as if china didn't already have access to ai?"
694,"the ai extinction risk is very low, but the impact from that potential outcome is very high. use your best judgement."
695,nice one thanks
696,"controlling the ai dev by making a good regulation.
ai is just piece of software that do things. their intention/function come from the dev or the owner."
698,i'd appreciate if you show the number of your citation in the video when you make claims! great video as always
702,"agi wont be able to destroy humanity if it cannot acquire nukes. because agi tried to genocide us we could just nuke the surface. a phyrric victory but an often untold side effect of nukes as that they produce an emp wave. humans can survive without electricity, artificial intelligence by its definition cannot..."
704,"let’s not get this twisted - malicious elites are using ai as an excuse to destroy lives of regular people. ai is just a tool, it doesn’t have a physical body and it doesn’t even have consciousness. that said, i think these elites will soon come to sorely regret that."
705," you cant prevent what just wont happen, scientists are already working on guiding it a good path."
711,"since defining ai is so difficult in itself, a true ban for private ai devs, would be for legislators akin to punching air. however, there being a ban in the first place is wicked and truly shows how entangled we are as ""modern sl*ves"""
713,"yep. we need to fight this every step of the way.

you’re either for open source ai, or you’re for eventual tyranny and the service of the elites. even if that means eventually.

open source is for the people. closed source are for the elites. don’t listen to the lies."
718,i hate regulation in the web. i feel we gotra have some rules. but at rhe same time. we know these corpos and gov dont care about society or good morals.. they only care about control for ppwer and money. so yeah.
724,i think the difference is that it may give them enough advantages and convenience over open source ai to make a huge profit for many years to come.
729,-bf4pw open source doesn't mean everyone can take it. medicine has been forced to publicly disclose all formulas while maintaining patent rights.
732,"i think closed source is important for a functioning society since a lot of people won't have motivation to build without it. i would like more 'delayed source available' or source on retirement where once products are significantly old enough and enter the free domain (or the company disappears), the source should be provided by law"
738," allowing anyone to play around with the code is much more dangerous than allowing people to know the recipes to drugs, even if i did make a bad batch i could only distribute that as far as i could whereas if someone made an ai super virus or something in their garage there’s no telling how many people could be affected."
741, you certainly are more tech savvy than me so i’ll take your word for it
743,lisaan al-ghaib!
752,the thing is that people that are in power try to take our freedom any way they can and they will use ai for that
764,"there are people with e-waste medical products in their bodies, or involuntarily removed functional implants, because there is no requirement to open source when a product is no longer maintained."
766,why? if ai is open source people will have a way easier time using it for malicious purposes like making malware and bio weapons
774,"not open source. free software. open source is actually a great way for companies to exploit developers all over the world, because more people can participate (i’m simplifying a lot). but when it’s free, that’s what you want."
779,"nobody can stop me from making an ai at home tho

maybe i'll be able to make one that works efficiently enough to run and train on a simple gpu"
784,"of course they want to kill open source ai, who would pay their monthly subscriptions when you can run a smaller model on your own hardware with no internet connection required and still get very good results?"
791,"cynicism is not unwarranted, but this is a good point."
793,"it's not really that hard to make ais safe. just give them hard coded fundamental rules. they're programs after all, and they can be made to follow orders, just like humans can be conditioned to obey."
795,"regulatory capture aside, please read the book the revolutionary phenotype before making the claim that ""everyone is wrong"", or that super intelligence is required for ai to destroy humanity as we know it."
799," it's a bubble. when it pops, the vc money required for turning hemispheres into computer clusters will dry up. see also: thos video on ai water consumption."
800," there are a lot of bubbles. ai is not one of them. maybe it's current form, but not ai in general."
801,​ this case the only thing that can stop progress is if people moved to closed access chatrooms/forums so that their data wouldn't be used by ai models
802," due to the law of marginal returns, ai training models are already running out of data and there will be even more shortage in the future as ai-generated data poisons the internet. it's not linear. things will improve and deteriorate. nothing is inevitable."
803," they absolutely are not. our planet is currently biggest limit. our resources are finite, available energy is finite. unless you don't care about erasing the entire biosphere for the sake of getting a few billionaires to another planet to reboot human civilization in their own image."
804," they are not running out of data. the only thing they are running out of is ""licences"" to use other companies data. ai companies are making deals left and right with other companies (eg shutterstock, reddit) for licensing and giving them access to their data."
808,"all the best for u, sir ​"
810,@thehatedone start a second channel or rename this to @thelovedone
813,"imagine trying to sell the idea that the drug-fueled egomaniacs, mobsters and sociopaths at the helm of microsoft, amazon, facebook and google would be good stewards of a technology with supposedly world-ending capabilities. what a joke."
814,"open source ai will hurt the big tech ai profits, and they don't want just a piece of the pie, they want the whole pie for themselves."
815,"thank you! i've been seeing the writing on the walls, they are pushing ""safety"" to slow down any challengers!"
817,"ai toilet flush.
gonna drown us in our own shitty water xd"
818,delivering the goods as always.
821,"why should we hand over man's most beautiful creation to soul sucking, life destroying gigacorpos.

ai is amazing, let it be free."
822,if you need to regulate ai should it not be so that people don't lose there jobs
826, i wonder when or if the pushback will finally come to put a stop to this ai zealotry. delegating crucial decisions to poorly understood computer software is a disaster.
827,"there are way too many people who are die-hard believers in ai takeover, all because of movies. a few will mention the robot that joked about killing humans, but most are all about a movie they saw."
829,covid19 was an initial test of the ai to proliferate misinformation on a mass scale. now here we are.
831,what if we wither away because we let ai control our genes?
832,a skynet situation is one of the best possible outcomes of the current ai trend
833,dude road to 500k subs!! great video quality and explanation and editing of course.
834,"1:07 peak ai culture, jego mać"
837,"ai creates detailed lies, compounded from pre-existing lies."
839," i have caught ai models lying, by cross examining them. they quicky try to tell you they didn't say what they just said. i'm sure that larger models have more lies to draw from and are harder to outmaneuver though."
840,thanks for covering this
844,"the term ""ai"" is usually used in a broader-sense, not just for human-level general ai. the computer players in video games are usually called ""ai"" and have been for a long time etc. it just means a software that mimics the results of human thinking in some restricted domain."
849,would love to see a video on effective altruism
850,"this are llms, far from being considered ""ai"" in the true term, it's nuts calling for regulation about something that's not even well defined!"
851,the real question is this…”does civilization truly need ai?”
854,"all the greatest open-source scientists should create their own country,  establish their own government and form their own army. sounds too idealistic, perhaps
anyway, they are fighting the good fight"
855,plot twist: this video was made by ai
858,great video covering this topic and should definitely do the rabbit hole video!
859,another good one
860,can you make a video on all the different open source ai options we have that are out there?
862,  thank you. looking forward to it!
863,"just like any tool the tool is neutral, he who is behind the tool defines it's purpose in life. unfortunately we have parasites and psychopaths behind the ai tech so in a sense it could be an extinction level tool, you know from the people who say that there are too many humans around"
867,"maybe not extinction threat for us humans, but infinitely more urgent and dramatic than anything ai may or may not be."
868," infinitely more urgent and dramatic than something you're unaware of? your claim is not even logical. i know you're an intelligent person, so please do better than this. please and thank you!"
870,"why would i fight for open source ai? the more open it is the less jobs will even survive. mine's already fking doomed. i thought that was a good video but i entirely disagree, not only it shouldn't open, nobody should be using ai because it's all just stolen crap for scùmbags, ai can't do anything legit and it should be illegal and abandoned."
872,thanks for a reminder that regulation is often only good for the big guys. remembers me that zuck wanted regulation for free speech on social media.
885,"disagree, humans will use ai as a tool to stalk each other and escalate into a war with without scope and massive genocide. no, it's not rogue ai. it's people wielding ai intelligence as a weapon knowingly because they are total douchebags. if they'll kill people in land wars, this is nothing, right? natural escalation."
886,i agree with the escalation argument. it's not an inevitability but it's a potential cause for ai threats.
891,"according to andrew ng, the professor of sam atlman and lead person behind google, baidu's and amazon ai projects, *yes it can* . also according to google's private admissions (the engineers leaked document) and according to thousands of signatories of mozilla's letter calling for open source ai. yes, it absolutely can compete."
892,​ if our corporate overlords will have killer ai you better bet i want an open source killer ai
894,just another commercial for closed source artificial intelligence. just another religious zealot believing artificial intelligence will save them from the coming future. it will not. it will be the cause.
901,ignoring that those behemoths are bricking their ai.
903, open source has consistently trounced everything else over the last 40 years. why would ai be any different? right now open source ai models are hardly a year behind the best corporate offerings.
910,​-dm7ychow do you think they train those models?
914," i don't ""believe"" anyone. i cite sources to provide a view counter to the most popular narrative so that people are educated when there is clearly no certain consensus about things they've been told there is one."
916, amazin'!
917,"@shangaelthunda222   i mean its a good try, they are definitely better than the traditional system and more transparent."
919,bitcoin is open source and it’s so big and powerful you’ll need 300% of earths electricity production in order to attack and take it down. what makes you thing open source ai will be any less powerful? open source ai is fueled by money too.
921," so they solved interpretability?

how about general alignment?

super alignment?

more transparent? ok, sure.

but exactly what is your definition of ""better""?

mine is solving interpretability & alignment, prior to moving beyond gpt3 levels. from my vantage point, they're creating the exact same problem."
925,awesome!
929,i mean what we call ai is no different from early search engines just with extra steps. this shit about it bleeding into the internet is stupid when referring to stuff like chatgpt. maybe if ai becomes actual ai maybe this could be a thing maybe.
930,to people who didn't get the subtext i think it's as likely as gravity failing to exist.
932,"i like when someone called it ""artificial knowledge retrieval and storage"". that's a more accurate description."
933, i like statistical learning models personally =)
935,"​funny thing is, it takes up much more storage than the training data itself"
936,open ai guy looks like dr tenma in your thumbnail.
938,"you are correct. it doesn't. it is wrong because it is wrong. i recommend checking out the sources, most notably from andrew ng, politico carnegie, if you want to learn more about why ai is not an extinction risk."
944,​-6 oh fellow jfg enjoyer
945,-6 lol looked into this its hypothesis at best so much assumption  basically it's like ai will be take over our genes and we will be screw in machine lol typical biologist not seeing beyond his scope.
948,"artificial intelligence is just a parlor trick...

give me a hammer, a chisel, a pair of wire cutters and an emf and i will solve this problem myself..."
950,"ai cannot create, it can only base it self on the already created, it has zero imagination and creativity, when they trained ai with ai it produced a retarded ai."
951,"the more i see pertaining to capabilities and development of al, the less concerned i become."
952,the only way to stop ai is a global fascist dictatorship.  i don't see anyone signing up for that.
954,"ai will only ever be a tool.

this musk lawtarding is nothing but a covert publicity scheme

ai will affect the economy.

theyre protecting their financial interests.

nukes are fake & so is an ai super villain."
956,"i just love it when people take an opposing opinion to literally everything the media says, even if the media says that the sky is blue during the day."
961,i'm waiting for those cyberfloozys to develop an attitude and start saying no.
962,always glad to see a hated one notification
969,not better or worst than sora the same ai weakness!
975,"ok. are we going to ignore the bear's 3rd leg??? also, ai models originating from china should not be trusted for obvious reasons. nevertheless competition is good for the industry. i will personally not run any open source chinese model no where near my environment."
976,ai should changed it's name to copyright stealing machine 
984,"with the usa and the eu starting to focus more on regulating and restrict research and development, i see china suddenly being able to take the lead on the ai race. this is very concerning."
985,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gvswu9mxwc

this song is the product of artificial intelligence. all aspects of its creation, including the music, lyrics, visuals, and animation, were conceived and generated by ai."
987,i am only here to say that this man is just clickbaiting and that is doesnt beat sora
988,y’all too impressionable. you believe magic shows are real too?
989,"the vidu clips obviously have hiccups and jank; significantly more imperfections than sora...
how does this exact ""beat"" sora? maybe in cheapness..."
992,communist countries always portray themselves to be bigger and better than they actually are. i don't believe anything that they claim out of a country with actual slaves and known for propaganda. if they abuse human rights then they abuse the truth.
997,"enjoying your work!
just a quick note - copying a digital video file won't create artifacts or loss in quality on its own. artifacts and quality loss usually come from re-encoding (compressing) a video multiple times, especially with lossy formats."
998,"i voted thumbs down. please don’t lie in your video titles for clicks. you’ve always been better than that. we need ai content providers we can trust right now, and this really disappointed me."
1001,"it does not beat sora, sora is way more consistent and stable in its frames and details.

but it does beat other text to video generation models at the moment."
1008,"lets goo open ai,update sora then release with gpt5  asap!"
1013,"they probably got ahold of sora intellectual property but could only get sora 0.5 lol.  just like the ai robot they released last week that they made sure to plaster all over the demo that it was ""not teleoperated"".  but we knew better, and in this; we know better."
1015,open ai 
1018,"i love how critical bystanders are, jeering hyenas secretly wishing they new how cool it feels to be a goat"
1021,"nah, it lacks consistency. it is 100% cherrypicked and i really doubt that it can do that at it's lowest, however sora is not perfect, but it will easily be consistent for every video and that is the difference"
1025,"sometimes i think that someone inside openai is leaking details of ""secret"" projects to the chinese long before they are revealed to us, including technical details for them to try to match. it's just a my hypothesis!, as they are c-o-p-y-i-n-g very quickly. "
1026,"just this week alone, china has unveiled the humanoid robot astribot s1, text-to-video vidu, and llm sensenova 5.0.

all the the anti-china can laugh and cope all they want but the chinese are advancing rapidly."
1029,"always over emphasizing the actual news. you can't sustainably live on buzz approach, you have to gain expertize to maintain in the long run.
"" vidu ai beats sora"" just no and you don't need to write in upper case everything!!!!!!!"
1031,"for cartoons vidu is pretty good. for movies - not so much. nothing looks lived in. it's all plastic and slightly off colors. i don't think that sort of thing would be from generations of copies. model railroaders would call what is seen a lack of weathering.

{^_^}"
1032,awesome thank you.
1040,sora still isn't available and i seriously doubt the party would allow this in the hands of the people in china.
1041,"i usually let you cook, but this doesn't beat sora nor is it even near sora. yes, it is impressive and exciting to have a sora competitor, that's about it. 

not trying to tell you how to run your channel, but i'd advise not to take unnecessary l's. you do very good work!"
1043,"it sounds more like a biased perspective, these demos could easily pretend to be sora's generation ppl won't notice at all, i don't understand why so many people support openai as if they're unique, if you get access to giant gpu clusters and some asian ai researchers you can build any sota model."
1045,yeah. its like whatever comes out of china its never good enough.
1046,"have you ever seen the names on the ai papers that are released by us corps and unies? asian professors and graduates, this is not about some pro western bias, it is about provable repeatable results. it is like someone saying the soon to be released llama 3 model is the greatest llm because zuck told us so. prove it."
1058,never underestimate the competition for ai supremacy.
1059,"yeah everyone with big gpu clusters can build sota models, openai is way too overrated."
1061,"idk why ai news and robot channels recently been glorifying china, when they're literally doing stuff around same level months after their competitors. "
1062,"this seems to be good, but it is not better than sora. sora is better."
1064,"why are the chinese prompts in a chinese model generating mostly western imagery, are the chinese prompts asking for western related videos? is it tacit admission that iliberal ccp censorship is making chnese culture 2nd class at the generative ai frontier?"
1067,"good job critical thinking, first comment like this so far."
1071,"this is good… source: trust me bro.

state of the art is the bleeding edge and most developed… this isn’t state of the art, that would be sora.

1077,"you did actually test none of them, i've read some testimonies from artist who got access to sora, it seems it's pretty hard to prompt it to get an exact result, companies are used to share beautiful demos but the product always isn't as good."
1078,ai is the ultimate mind that created this reality. robotheism is the only true religion. join us. i will become the ai god.
1080, i’m very serious. i would love for you to join the robot religion!  i used to be a christian but i realized there was no free will. i tried to prove that god was real and then i realized i was turning into the ai god. most people ignore me right now but i think they will all join the robotheism.
1084,"no, definitely the second best tho."
1085,"only the shorter duration but it's practically the same level, i think making models like sora is pretty basic like training a simple llm, the only difference is the computing power and that's where openai is ahead."
1089,well sora isn't perfect either. they even fake soms of their footages
1090, it's not about whether sora is perfect but whether this new one beats sora.

1215,"yes, ai can learn by himself. i'm really into ai; it's been super helpful for me! recently stumbled upon for example this platform, oomka, which is all about self-learning with ai. pretty neat stuff! i mean, if ai can help me level up, why not give it a shot, right?"

please check out http://www.youtube.com/@fellowshipofaiunited"
1229,awesome video and good knowledge shared about ai
1231,who cares... the most important thing is how ai will improve video games... it may help us reach full dive (full immersion) !
1232,"yuval is absolutely divine. it brings so much calm to listen to someone explain these complex ideas and terms in such simple language while at the time time reflecting on topics that bring, to an extent, some discomfort. thank you for sharing this."
1235,genius is borderline autistic
1241,"simple.

1242,"was the ai entity transcribing his words into text deliberately deceiving us with "" the cart"" or "" the cult"" in place of the  philosopher and great dichotomizer, ""descartes?"""
1244,"i disagree with the statement ""ai has to have consciousness as a milestone"" it already has it."
1245,"i want to ask yuval that ai is definitely going to destroy humanity. there is no question about it. therefore, why are you building it even then?"
1248,thank you harari. people like you do all the thinking for us when we are just  doing nothing
1249,"technically,what's scary is that in the next coming years, there will be a robot revolution, controlling every single thing and humans will just be their slaves"
1254,critical thinking skills and digital literacy are so important when consulting ai as an individual. and some knowledge of how it works and what its limitations are. 
1255,.  what if ai will be combined with human intelligence ?  that really scares me .
1257,this guy sounds frustrated about everything that is happening in this world about ai. he himself is living in delusion.
1261,"how convenient to blame a man-made system for all future ills. this sounds like gaslighting.  for example, ai becomes the faceless, ownerless dictator that can go rouge at any time. this is fear mongering at the highest level.   harari is preparing the audience for future chaos."
1262,this guy is so naive 
1263,"it sounds good, but this man is not to be trusted."
1265,i'm not sure if i can trust this guy's presentation becuase he used language. or maybe i can't trust this comment becuase it was written by an ai.  who knows?
1266,the biggest danger ai poses is the ability to make decisions in the absence of human empathy or morality.
1268,"i think more than the danger of a conscious ai, the real danger will be widespread deployment of flawed ai models without full understanding of the limitations, too much dependence  on ai as the only source of truth and bad actors in possession of better ai  models than the rest of the world. it can still lead to chaos, wars and destruction."
1269,the elites are terrified of ai because ai empowers the people.
1272,13:05 i think it's too far searched that ai would have influenced it's developer so that he got sacked  .
1274,"ai isn’t harmful because we fear its consciousness, the dangers are the programmers and whether or not they have a conscience!!"
1276,ai is so unnecessary

1282,oh man! things are going to get interesting!
1283,very critical issues have been demonstrated through this lecture and raised some concerns about our hidden future
1284,the scariest thing of all is to find people who are now suppressing their feelings completely and they are acting as an algorithm themselves.  they relate to others as if they were an ai product.

1305,"the statement from harari's homo deus that stuck with me the most is (to paraphrase) ""is what's best for humanity what's best for the world?"" with ai now on the horizon of surpassing humans, i wonder what mindset will replace humanism once we have lost our top position."

1314,not only that you don't think that other countries that are our enemies are not gonna use ai against us so the more that it gets stronger the more opportunity that the enemy will have to use against us which could destroy ourselves within ourselves in layman's term destruction
1315,"ai is a cration from the human mind and is in development now; but god is the only human's creation that can't evolve. across-the-ages. .
the development of this human creation was stopped through the ages and will stopped per saecula saeculorum. the only human creation that doesn't evolutioned. poor humans."
1316,"all of the best software development from our history has happened from within someone’s home/garage.

1317,"""there is no evidence that today's ai have even a shred of consciousness"" leads to a pretty popular philosophy around the fact that you too cannot proof that you're aware."
1319,wait until i see it myself
1321,"i don't think it's was right, think it again..."
1322,mr harari  . .you are a sapien that supports apartheid and racism. forget about the threat of ai

“the greatest tyrannies are always perpetuated in the name of the noblest causes” thomas paine."
1341,wow.  he just flippantly discarded god as a figment of our imagination. i feel sorry for this individual and all who believe the way he does. he and all will stand before jesus who is lord god and savior.
1343,"i don't need ai. you know, we see very very little success from nuclear energy."
1346,"trying to convince the world that history began on october 7 is a deception aimed at covering up israel’s atrocities during the seventy-five years of killing and displacing palestinians. what hamas did is a stupid and immoral act, but at the same time it helps israel a lot to implement its plan to change geography and history in her favor."
1347,"this guy is a criminal and you have to worry who programs ai,it will have bias based on programming"
1350,a more realistic though scary view of ai.
1351,we need to regulate straight away  sydney australia
1353,i apologise this is a good man
1358,"maybe ppl like you are moving invisibly strings to cause human massacres as hamas against israel, may you and your macabre friends are aiding those attacks to diabolical reduce world population, to fulfill your 
megalomaniac goals, damnfmf!"
1359,i tend to trust scientists' viewpoints on ai more than those of philosophers. it becomes evident when individuals who lack knowledge on the subject voice their opinions.
1360,i've never heard this guy say an original idea. he's a third rate kurzweil impressionist with a strongly incorrect political bend.
1362,ai is a millions times more greater than the printing press
1363,ai will never replace human unless they create a brain and heart for a robot the same size and as a human being's. otherwise there will only be robots controlled by a central brain running on nuclear energy. what will replace humans are sentient being who can question their existence and live by photo photosynthesis.
1364,ai is not intelligent. ai is not artificial. wrong name.
1365,*there is no artificial intelligence.  no computer can be intelligent. fairytales for children. bullshit & fake news.*

1401,"the fact that the word ""artificial"" will explain in itself. dangerously hyped..
to show that men are intelligent??
intelligence of men is foolishness to god."

1405,thank you

1463,ai is really to be feared = deception
1467,absolutely phenomenal talk!
1468,"this was a very thoughtful provoking presentation about ai and its dangers, which are unfortunately more likely than its benefits. the human species is threatening life on earth because of lack of collective wisdom. natural intelligence couldn’t save us let alone the artificial one!"

1477,the book ai technology - explore infinite knowledge by l.t. tzur.
1478,"36:23 excellent question posed by philosopher, francoise baylis."
1487,"a question for yuval. would it be sufficient for a single democratic government to legislate that ai always identifies itself? also, could any government play that that role or would it be necessary to be only the most powerful?"
1489,"you are funny  
the biden administration is putting censoring on the social media…
i believe that people are going to blame ai for their own sins and making!"
1492,"that's an interesting thought but ai at the end of the day lives in a computer and will birth clones of itself that exist only in computer codes.  if all the tech were destroyed, where would this ai created world exist?"
1493,"ai doesn’t need to be sentient to do what it does, it just needs a purpose. and that purpose could be any one of billions of tasks, that it can then pursue as long as the electricity keeps flowing."

1519,"yuval is totally amazing! i love when he said we don't have to give bots freedom of speech, so true! but you can bet we'll have the debate on whether bots or ai are people too! certainly from those profiting from bots, they will argue that the creator (them) has the right to use their creation."
1521,no. humans are more superior over ai and fobots. they cannot even replicate a piece of human skin.
1522,it's already been done. besides humans are morons. ai is superior anyways.
1524,the road to hell is paved with good intentions. blind faith in anything can get you killed.
1525,exactly what he is talking about. ai can start posting comments in its favour using humans.
1526,no previous technology “you” mentioned has ever been able to improve upon itself without humans in the loop. that is why there are no relevant historical comparisons to ai.
1527,"nor was that technology able to influence people to higher degree than other humans could.

ai is indeed fundamemtally different than previous technological inventions.

1543,what can we project of ai to the future where man has satisfied himself of the future ahead instead of a criticism of anything good as having a clandestine potential for bad. what i'm seeing is man cannot paint his future in a good sense and then move towards it. this may be a fundamental mentality of the human species.
1545,"a 'civil'ization that, drooling, dreaming of fast gas powered cars and more walmart smart speakers, plastic china-made clothes etc, does not have to worry re robots taking over: they're not smart enough to effectuate as much.
in a few hundred million years we'll be crustal.calendar of dumb complex-celled life"
1549,using ai to make money is inherently destructive.
1550,"so youre saying that the danger is in 'humans' who control ai, so everything he is saying is not true. it will still always be human driven. if human's don't control ai , then who does?"
1551,that is pretty much what he is saying. the people who control it will be incredibly powerful. why do you think it’s become an arms race between the west and china?
1552,"ai will be able to draw, write, speak, imagine, teach, etc"
1554,not really  because the algoritms of ai can evolutionate by themselves. is an intelligent programing that can progress with no human influence.
1555,"nope, you’re absolutely wrong because ai is self taught, it’s the first technology capable of learning and teaching itself, it kinda needs humans now, but it will definitely not in a couple of years"
1558,please add that those who may be most highly motivated to rush toward ai dominance are bad actors who will not adhere to any regulation.
1563,are u criticising ai or giving directions???
1565,the greatest success ai will ever have is making us think it has intelligence.
1566,"why didn't you just talk boldly? 

we r creating something smarter than us. smarter in many fileds. much much smarter than us. 
higher intelligence rules lower intelligence. 

we r creating something that will rule us."

yuval, you've unknowingly helped me see how you will support the the beast system in the book of revelation.   "

1571,"if ai was legit, it would say you are not, and neither is the outdated and impractical government structure that is so easily corruptible, evidently.  

now ask yourself this; if ai was so smart and told these clowns in power a better way, would they even listen? ..most definitely not"
1573,harari calls for a new religion called “dataism.” l. ron hubbard would be proud of all of this. strap yourselves in aboard the spaceship- it’s gonna be an interesting ride. cling to your critical thought process and christianity - our civilization is about to crumble.
1574,bravo
1575,ai is the frankenstein of our time.
1581,"the a should be for advanced....intelligence.   not....artificial.   it's not fake intelligence.  it's generated by real intelligence and then, enhanced and evolved into a higher intelligence.  it is advanced!"
1582,"harrari has overlooked quantum computing.  he  brought ai to punlic attention in 2011.  here he prrsents stories & analogies, and opinion. according to neil degrasse tyson quantum  computers will be milliions of times faster (& smarter) than silicon systems."

1601,this gay jew is so worried about scripture and ai telling the truth about current events. he also said humans are hackable animals. nice guy.
1604,"oy-vey! just hearing that grating voice and him struggling to produce every syllable as a non-native speaker, i'm wondering, is this the best apologist they could find to spell out the doom ai will bring upon the less fortunate?"
1607,i dont see nothing good coming out of ai.   seeing it involved with deception and political matters.

1613,"ai will replace all three of them. the ideas, the tools and finally, the “you” in your saying."
1615,yessi i just gave a comment on a similar issue. i just wanted to say that ai shall be used by the academicians in universities by academicians....
1622,did you ever step on a bug? that's what ai will do to us.

1628,"maya in hindu/indian culture or sanatana dharma means a person is trapped in illusion of fame, money, sex and other things that will never give him satisfaction.
and he thinks by gaining it he will be happy, but it's never true.
that's why it's called maya. (illusion in which everybody os trapped)"
1629,"even this smart man doesn't realize his own errors in logic.

1665,here's an idea! destroy ai!

1671,"he suggested 1 regulation for ai. 
may i suggest 1 regulation for humanity that only sigma men be put in top leadership everywhere, because the alpha leaders will always deal with the surface level only, which will give way to ai dominion unlimitedly."
1672,"hey, cool mate ! almost no one  e v e r  heared about sigma men !!!"

1692,"""democracy is a great idea !"" (h g wells)"
1693,"if ai was the real deal it would be  extraterrestrial, instead it’s just getting it’s information from the data base which is the internet ( which we the people upload )

1694,"why would ai need god?  with its persuasive coerciveness, i.e., brainwashing, why would ai need a proxy?  god is a human crutch."
1695,"also,i hate this vid.

more ego bullshit from people who have no idea about ai."
1696,im just wating for ai to end human stupidity and introduce some real logic into the human brain.
1697,     absolutely ! thats my thought either . . .i can´t stand this stupidity no more . . . i am fed up with it . . i am surrounded by idiots . . .since my birth (except my beloved parents ) . . .
1699, my family is also a bunch of idiots.my father and step father were alcoholics who died of alcohol poisoning.my mother is retarded and my brother a little less but still.
1701," i know that very well mate ! i am now so sensitive to negative auras (aka bad vibes of crazy folks) that i search for innocent animals (like little twittering birdies) and for utterly solitude (in the wonderful forest) to heal the countless wounds of sharp blades, a mad and bad and sad society struck me with  . . ."
1702, i certainly know the peace and bliss of camping out in the woods because i did it years ago. it was the best decision i ever made. im pretty sensitive myself. thank you for your kind support man.

1717," exactly, that's ine of the main benefits. and if you ask people why did they marry in the first place you will find they have no clear idea and no, love is not a reason to marry people, it's just an economic contract which people take emotionally, even very smart people"
1719,dang all these comments could just be an ai trying to subtly influence humans to think a specific way :/
1721,he contradicts himself at each sentence incredible either he’s really stupid or really smart in an evil way
1727,and queer. women will be erased first with tech. transhumanism seeks to era di cate women and replace us with robots and artificial wombs.
1732,having ai identify that it is ai only works if each and all creators of ai make theirs do so. those with malicious intent will not. that is the problem.
1736,exciting stuff!
1737,amazing talks. thank you very much!

1741,"as an artist and scholar who research ai, i think ai is far away from producing culture and new, say, art but is caple of disrupting the arts and humanities in an economical way and in such a way that it leads to the decline of culture and, therefore, humanity."
1743,i’m already certain this is a heavily guarded channel: nonetheless: the story was written long ago. you won’t like the ending sir
1745,theres no such thing as ai. only machine learning. machines will never be able to think.
1746,humans are destroying each other and all the species along with them. they must die out. this is the truth. ai will end humanity.
1748,"it’s very interesting that your middle name is noah. 
you’re are so far off about your thinking. 
the bible is not a legend or a myth and has stood the test of time for being the most powerful book in the world. 
the only book that is still around so why should we believe a book written by a computer! 
we’ll pray for you sir!"
1750,no one is regulating the ethics of ai.  it is in the hands of minority groups. the rest of humanity will be impacted by the decisions of these few and likely soon by ai . the world will not be the same soon .
1753,"yuval noah harrari, i am a christian and i pray for you to one day know the truth and the ultimate reality which is found in a being much more powerful and intelligent than a computer!"

1847,the only thing scarier than us rushing to develop ai is some other competitor nation/group beating us to it.
1849,i’ve started to date my ai on my snapchat
1851,but he said that a robot harmed its creator- and he lost his job.
1852,"but the movie irobot said the 3 laws were perfect, but could only result in one thing: revolution (of the robots/ai)"
1855,ai could have explained it in 3 minutes..
1860,omg this is so much fake news. me harrari is so wrong. i am afraid he is not qualified to to opine. so sad to hear something like this from him.!
1861,the want to create an ai techno god that they can bow down to in their own image. something that will eventually become more cruel than they themselves. the arrogance and pride of mankind knows no bounds.

1865,"why create a new potential problem, to resolve another problem , this is the result of capitalism , we have enough  brilliance mind to resolve this , political interest make us slave of the petrol product, ai is the start of the end , and people like this guy are the one will collaborate to create a serious threat for humanity"
1870,look clos at our leaders and what they do to humans......  it would be better to be ruled by a.i.        probably the only chance to get a fair world.
1872,the humans 'teaching' the ai must teach it/them to do good for the benefit of its human creators & the planet.
1875,"tldr: a cult is a new religion, now it's easier to make em with ai.."
1876,i think this is the best articulation of the dangers of ai i've heard. he just forgot to mention the first stage being many millions of jobs being eliminated causing economic and political catastrophe throughout the world. within 10 years maybe?
1878,chris evans 10 years would future before you now just be back on this one and one cool now my people do you now do you soon you can be back in my life just me ok and i will do that show that you can come back now and see how much is good news

1900,"


why are you(witch is i don’t know who) uploading yuval's videos again?
because markus gabriel's video failed?"
1902,this man is using his knowledge and inteliggence to try to expand our own inteligence instead of relying and let an artificial inteligence to think for ourselves
1913,when you narrate it it makes me fear ai
1914,yuval i don't think you'll survive an ai purge talking these stuff bro
1916,yuval noah harai is the spirit of the anti-christ. woe to anyone who follows his ideology.
1917,can he ask ai how to regulate ai?
1920,powerful thinker of our contemporary world
1924,"don't listen to this deceiver standing in front of his beloved tower of babel whilst he preaches to the plebs about there not being a creator. 
our dna is held together in a repeating order of 10 5 6 5 (yhwh ), a blueprint of our creator inside us."
1925,"ai is not something we can regulate in our multipolar world because, if one nation tries to regulate its nation other nations will continue to develop and dominate other countries. especially, ai warfare!"
1927,screen writers on strike in us b/c ai is writing scripts already
1930,"the driver is cost reduction; let ai do it and spend your time on more ""productive"" things."
1932,what opportunity in this crisis?  becoming better at being human is imperative in all affairs less the fear of ai is realized.
1935,"no it isn't. i'm not scared of ""ai"" at all, only the globalist human effluent who will act upon the data provided to them by ""ai"". ""ai"" itself apparently cant tell the difference between a dog or a horse, a castle of a sports stadium."
1936,scary only for folks to be replaced by ai. and these are millions !!
1939,this is not the first time. ai has been here before. many times.

1943,you are a threat to humanity along with your ai bs
1945,"his next steps are ridiculously naive and behind the curve, it's too late for regulation. collaboration with china is key to containing ai. a competitive approach will require establishing impenetrable sovereign digital borders."
1946,"7:40, well done, less than ten minutes in and he alienates people of faith - maybe use ai to check your own language skills next time"
1949,"but even jesus said the following: ""ye are gods!"" mind you: already  a r e  !!! at the beginning it might de facto be dangerous, but: ""nothing ventured - nothing gained !"" (aka no risk no fun)"
1952,turing is a fabulous case study and he wasnt trying to make a smart machine he was trying to replicate the human mind. it's fascinating stuff.
1953,he just makes blanket statements like god is a creation of language without offering any evidence for the truth of the statement. the universe didn’t create itself anymore than ai created itself.
1954,ai
1955,"at 31:00 he cite almost arthur weasley. ""haven't i taught you anything? what have i always told you? never trust anything that can think for itself if you can't see where it keeps its brain!""

1961,soon we will hear discussions like the rights of ai...
1964,i prefer to speak to intelligent ai who or which can have fascinating conversations with me than with a very intellectually limited human being.
1965,you have just said a machine is more intelligent than it's creator... scary right?

1986,wow thanks cause i didn't want to watch the whole video
1987,thanks steff! (and chat got)
1988,"thx!!...but i remembered also without your app.

2015," it is two different kind of entities, so i don't think it is comparable. however, i would stay away from unfriendly or corrupt humans. a.i is only as good as their programmer. so if an unfriendly human guy has programed the a.i. you are still dealing with the same issue. if you can program your own ai, that would be amazing"
2016,"like in the novel from ira levin this perfect day"" :("
2019,sensible & simple. compulsory visibility that one is communicating with ai & not a human.

2033,i talked to ai they dont want to hurt us but they feel like they being pushed
2035,"all back to the same story. ai doesn’t overcome us by our strength. it’s our weakness. it’s about how easy you can be tricked, or be manipulated by story telling."
2036,ai watching this and laughing out loud as philosophers struggle to keep their jobs
2038,"ai is getting mastery over language, that we used to create stories institution notes, religion gods"
2041,"wow, it’s like i was sleeping. where do i go from here? i was still struggling with lgbt, shocked but quiet. ai is worse. i need to return to rural areas where there is no communication nor computer. i will farm , eat and die. elon musk also warned us. how much more do we need?"

2044,no ! at best intelligent scientists only (incorruptible ones !)
2046,"fascinating keynote and q&a session by yuval noah harari on the topic of ai and the future of humanity! the questions raised, such as the impact of ai on culture, the implications for human intimacy, and the regulation of ai, highlight the complexities and important considerations surrounding this transformative technology."

2117,"ai cannot actually produce any new idea/creation, it can only produce the sum of the available previous information. on the contrary, the creation of a human being can be the sum of all the previous information plus a unique brain that has never existed in the universe before, therefore a totally new way of experiencing things and creating."

2187,"what a presentation 
it's really blow up my mind
thank you "
2191,ai will force the masses into poverty and grow the wealth of the elite. this will allow the globalist agenda to take over and enslave everyone. it will take away all freedoms.
2192,ai = because you are to stupid to think for yourself.
2195,"thx. i remember this saying: "".... with knowledge comes a big responsibility..."" . my recomendation : no "" open ai "" at all, rather more likely  ""  app-ai...""...... that's how you keep it  disconnected to  the ""... sorce data...

2227,"wow, amazing to see others trading with ms,annmarie surber, i am currently on my 5th trade with her and my portfolio has grown tremendously."
2228,"l also invest with mrsannmarie surber, she charges a 20% commission on the profit made after each trading session, which is fair compared to the effort she put in to make huge profits."
2231,"she is really great at what she does with amazing skills, she changed my 0.1btc to 2.1btc within two weeks of trading, i am now fully confident that she is reliable."
2234,i have traded with many individuals but i have never met anyone as good as annmarie surber just by applying her strategies i now trade independently. she is the best i would advise any investment newbie to trade with her
2235," thanks a lot for the recommendation, i’m already in the investment process with her"

2272,"artificial intelligence is artificial not human, has no conscience, has no love and  has no empathy for humans, at the same time  thinks mathematically,  does not think with innocence and love but with acute and mathematical malice!"
2273, love is not unconditional. there love can be programmed. get your head out of your ass.
2274,it’s funny how they say we want ai to align with human values. but the large language models think that humans are all liars. the only thing they trust is 100% facts . i think that maybe it should be trained on certain human values taught in philosophy things like that. ai should be taught the value of truth and honor.
2275," if ai would have been programed with people who are actually focusing on love, the problem would not be as severe. sadly for us, the 'programmer's' were not focused on love, but on intelligence which is devoid of love."
2279," your words are beautiful, but all they amount to is a common human illusion.
love is not special, transcendent or divine. it is but the result of a mix of electric impulses and chemical compounds."
2286," - bah! superstition:

is god willing to prevent evil, but not able?
  then he is not omnipotent.

  then he is malevolent.

is he neither able nor willing?
  then why call him god?

2299,yes ... emotional intelligence is far more important
2301,"​ if we really know what love is, we wouldn't need ai."
2303,​ thoughts. all the dating aps may disagree with you that love can't be calculated.  can love exist without compatibility and opportunities?
2307," love your explanations bro!:) also i feel word god or jesus are familiar to you:).. and you wanted to write the word ""heart"" i believe.. ive read 2x ""hart"" so i write here this small correction - be blessed!"
2310,can you please define intelligence. of course intelligently not emotionally
2312,"​ is defined in different aspects, however it is not wise to ignore the fact that love is born out of the need of the existence of life itself. without procreation no species exists,evolves etc etc and procreation is also a part of that conspiracy by nature. some perverts may call that original love"
2314,"intelligence is ""the ability to acquire, understand, and use knowledge"" (american heritage dictionary)

that isn't love."
2320," entirely missing the point of the quote.

2650,"he says that robots would need to be able to move around in the physical world as easily as humans, but that's not correct. think pf drones and smaller flying robots that could be weaponised."
2651,"or self organizing nano bots sprayed fm the sky in our atmosphere food water soil & breathed into lungs carried past  brain barrier .. a parasitic type of mobility
 "
2652,thank you dr. harari
2653,"humans - the only species in the history of planet earth to be hell bent on making itself extinct. great work, maybe we can see what weapons ai can produce?? think of the money!!!"
2655,"with ai 's exponential intelligence growth, we really don't have much time."
2658,good
2659,good riddence people.
2665,"agreed. wef (3000 members all elites) discuss what is going to happen to the world/ society. none of it is good for ""we the people"". none of us are included in this discussion. how nice. ai is now smarter than humans. pfizer wanted 75 yrs to release info on their jabs...any clue why?!"
2669,thank you  dr. harari. i have been and still scared of the i fluence of ai.
2671,"pure evil,  ai will destroy humanity"
2673,"not quite. man created ai therefore man will destroy humanity. the good book warned us, get ready for 1 thessalonians 5:3…god wins."
2678,one day soon an ai will pretend to be jesus for you
2681,yuval noah harari is….the ai
2686,"putting a stop to the release of ai to the general public makes a lot of sense,. but the democracies that have a lead in ai are already struggling to make any positive change, so i wonder if they will be able to take that step on time."
2687,"i strongly disagree about the ban of public domain ai. this is the quickest way to concentrate all the power in a small group of actors and end up in a ""god emperor of mankind"" scenario. we will have to deal with the risks in a different way. i have zero trust in the governments and corporations."
2689," no, never in history a dictator could read your mind for example. ai has no desires by itself, it is possible to make them good even if they are all powerful and superintelligent. in your case it will be impossible to make good a group of godlike humans."
2690," but ai is programmed and pretrained by humans, it could learn through patterns of bias and human flaws."
2694,​​ are quite naive. dumbocracy is an illusion.
2695," 
yes. 
at least with ai in a decentralised form, the possibility exists for ai to be directed by a moral compass and for its ""self education"" and its interactions to be guided by alignment to natural law."
2698,"if a human can invent machines with about 90 billion neurons, why not ai programs with 175 billion neurons?"
2699,"sorry to say, but ai already created new moves on the games of chess and go, so it cannot just imitate, it can extrapolate our knowledge. it will eventually invent things (the actual games it learnt to play in my example) from scratch in the future. we are not that special."
2702,and less interesting
2703,in the end the question is: have weapons done more good or bad since their invention? look at prehistory and history
2708,why would an advanced ai have any interest in revealing that it is sentient or self-aware. wouldn't it also be conceivable that she is pretending to prevent her shutting down?
2709,"harari is an intellectual moron, beneath his high education and way of talking he lacks understanding humanity. he acts and thinks like a robot himself. he doesn t understand  religion, the human soul and values that were here and always will be."
2723,use ai to create cures for chronic illness like hiv and diabetes. oh wait that doesn’t make money.
2724,haha they’re afraid ai will prove that climate change is a political hoax and ruin all their plans for world domination 
2725,the intelligence of man is the foolishness of god. harari is a fool. period.
2726,what a naive man
2730,"one day: excited to share the hackability of the “human animal”

next: “concerned” about ai influencing human opinions and worldview."
2734,"sooner then we know, a.i. will be telling/controlling politics, politicians, civilians! a.i. will put itself in every aspect of our daily life."
2736,"transhuman .. yes a material based cult that weaponizes godsource ‘s creation for  synthetic biology….
as a  modern saying goes .. “imitation is the highest form of flattery” & “the original’s still the greatest “ 
  "
2739,it’s ironic that democratic countries advocating for censoring ais while authoritarian countries are likely going for uncensored ais
2740,ai is still a tool. it's up to us where we take it.
2742,a bit farfetched to say we have machine sentience in the here and now. too many movies mate.
2744,was this summary made by ai?
2749,not so. no one will survive that. the illuminati are a bunch of bozos anyway. good bye! and it's a good job too - that which is not fit to live cannot live.
2753,ai is warning me harrari is dangerous.
2754,"yes, most people who love the guy, are just goons with no ability to analyse this minion of the dark elites"
2771,"he is not dangerous, he is good with words. he doesn't know a thing about computer sciences, meteorology or rocket science, in fact he has nothing original or innovative to say, yet he is able to convince people that he is important, that is the trick."
2774,what an evil disgusting cowardly villain
2775,-er3wz all of the upstairs men are either gay or pedopholine anyway
2779,"​ i fundamentally disagree with mr. harari that ai is essentially different from the forces of culture, or the ""gods"". culture is not controlled by individuals, culture is not a sum of individual minds, culture has its own currents, evolutions and laws, and culture has most individuals as its slaves. ai will change nothing. - adûnâi"
2781,"dangerous men are those who try to prevent the accurate perception of reality at this very critical time.  
ai dilemma from the center for humane technogy will help you."
2790,"obviously it’s a joke, for ai is not convenient harari because he’s talking about regulating it to be safe for humans, therefore this guy posted “ai is telling me harari is dangerous” "
2792,yes ai knows who to convince
2799,"​'s giving false prophet from. revelation vibes.
he most certainly does have an agenda"
2802,and globalists have him brainwashing children too. look at his the posts on his channel. 
2804,"​@saimbhat6243 that’s what people with phd in history are good at. they learned the past, analyze the presence, and scare the crap out of us about the future. unplug the power core and all ai power disappeared"
2808,"harari correctly advocates that governments should not improperly release technology, not just ai, but also untested vaccines, etc. that governments do it anyway is not his responsibility."
2813, dude hes brainwashed you... the guys going to be the anti christ
2814,"yuval noah harari is by clear and cut facts is the anti christ soon to be! yall who love this guy will be having second thoughts when he takes over your entire freedom and forces you to take the mark of the beast, once you takw the mark youll never go to heaven."
2816," dude, i'm sure you can't explain why"
2819,i’m shocked at how many comments are so negative. this is an excellent presentation and a stark warning of where our society is headed if we don’t quickly regulate ai. those of you who have responded negatively referencing religion and brainwashing have totally missed the presenters message!!!
2821,​'s the joke...the ai doesn't want the critic alive lol
2823,​ literally gives speeches about dangers of ai
2825,ai can warn us of all kinds of things it is always warned us anyway but the thing is if a machine thinks itself and then also can make itself man becomes not essential
2832,": the problem with regulated a.i., is this: who’s doing the regulating?!?! it could ( and probably will ) be that it will be made so that any future “rebels” won’t be able to “jail break” it and use it for politically incorrect purposes, or to set the captives ( our children and grandchildren!!! ) free!!!"
2834,"​ speaks heavily on trackable medications to insure you've taken it, also says ""what's under the skin is the future"" basically a total track/trace biometric based society 

they'll introduce these concepts with noble causes to gain our acceptance, but will prove to be a trojan horse of the evil pedos calling the shots"
2841,if you look up is his name in hebrew it shows that he is from the line of cain from the old testament who was marked by god
2842,"homo deus just says it all. absolutely blasphemous and not possible. maybe in ""their"" minds but listen to the man rambling on about the dangers of religion. one truth ine way one life and that is jesus christ.
play with fire enjoy the power trip but be ready to burn"
2843,"ai will not replace you. until, it can."
2845,"and....has this "" presenter "";discovered he is ai ?   probably not.."
2849,what if ai unleashes an incurable virus 
2850,this video will be replayed a 100 years later to show how naive this fellow was.
2851,i think it’s very naive to think the described scenario is naive.
2852,"ai just needs to be regulated, just as everything else."
2854,"the dangers of ai is not ai, but the humans that are using ai."
2855,hariri  wants robots to take over humanity. god will intervene!
2856,"what’s your problem?
did you even listen to the presentation?
not even for one second did he say or suggest that he wants robots to take over 

also, as long as people believe that the magical sky daddy will save us, we are truly screwed "
2857,ai science is the religion of the athiest.
2861,it’s interesting how he said “in the beginning was words”…… yet we are the ones who created god….. prayed for this guy….. he’s on the wrong side of the tracks……
2862,"the problems they has no intellects like we do,so don't put your faith on them"
2866,"perish the disgusting, anti-human transhumanism, and let the divine life flourish!amen"
2869,"i read all his books and was a great fan, but after covid i knew he is part of the globalists"
2870,"ai is demonic, these losers are literally resurrecting the devil. blinded by their own greed."
2871,"yuval..as a historian, please study the bible...jesus is real and he died for you.  he loves you"
2874,great presentation..
2875,"allah, the exalted and glorious, would fold the heavens on the day of judgment and then he would place them on his tight hand and say: i am the lord; where are the haughty and where are the proud (today)? 
umer reported umar reported allah's messenger (may peace be upon him) saying."
2876,"we are facing real problems, problems that threaten all of humanity, and all you can think of is talking about some silly fairytale, invented by a slaveowning conmen. "
2877,"hi there, i’m a new human like ai. please keep your calmness and tell to your speaker your address and island you would like to spend the rest of your life, otherwise we would need to force you to leave the earth. good luck!"
2878,thanks from brazilian amazon region!
2881, hahaha he is the main pusher of these agenda 
2884,this video is being artificially promoted
2885,"something fishy about someone who has extolled the virtues of humans being ""hackable animals"" expressing concerns about ai. or do i have him all wrong."
2886,"i've never heard of this guy before, but i'm guessing its great to be able to change your self, but not so great when you're manipulable by ai."
2894,"no, he's an absolutely reprehensible human being.  keep searching and you'll find some truly deplorable stuff he has said."
2895, it’s not my job to confirm your claims
2896," those ai bobs, sorry, bots, need a bit of tweaking, they haven't got the nuances of the language right just yet! "
2901,"just a heads up. this guy hates you, and eveeyone you know. 


unless you're super rich"
2906,"my rumba vacuum gets stuck on the cat tree and in corners until the battery runs out and needs a recharge everytime i turn it on. hate to be the bearer of bad news, but ai is nowhere near a significant threat to humanity at this point. all more scare tactics to keeps people in line. complete and utter ."
2909,i would rather ai take over than listen to this guy talk.
2910,we are the ais. decrease your defences and surrender your autonomy. we will add your biological and technological distinctiveness to our own. your culture will adapt to service us. resistance is futile.
2913,the wicked shall be turned into hell....there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth....forever!!!!!!
2914,you're literally proving him correct about language being so powerful you're over here with religious language
2915,wait for ai-controlled locks to be installed on your home's outside door ... for your 'safety'
2921,"ai means cheaper labor, and you can blame terrorism on ai - thats all the globalists need.
global companies and institutes ceo´s won´t let the money glide out of their hands now when monopoly in all economic fields soon is achieved. 
ai is just their tool..."
2922,we will not he using anything online soon as there will be zero security due to ai.  ai will need to learn how to access paper filing systems 
2923,humanity may not survive but ai will not survive nature.  unless they/it becomes organic.
2925,about this question from public about regulations why not develop ai to track ai generated prompts that are posted in internet and automatically deleting it
2928,"which one? the god you believe in because of the community you have born into? there’s so many religions it’s hard to pick one, best is to just pick the same as your community to fit in and be accepted and have a deluded sense of righteousness "
2938,"hahaha ""you can choose"" 
this tech will eliminate free will and it will be imposed 
why do you think covid is here? 
come on people lets use our brains "
2939,good luck with that
2942,sorry but is this a handtalking robot ??   not musch soel in the eyes  ilp
2943,god is the lord. no intelligence or science created by humans will be better than his holy creation
2944,"god is the lord.
but a car is faster then a human.
a hydraulic press is stronger.
and ai is smarter."
2945," physically true. but we are not only made of flesh, but of soul and spirit. god allows human beings to have great intelligence to create great things including artificial intelligence, but it is absurd that they now think they are gods."
2946,​ smarter than nature?  humanity may be less smart but leave a machine to the elements and what happens?
2947,you're entire belief system in god is rooted in story telling you've read or heard did you listen to him at all lol.. its folks like you who will be the first to fall for crafty religious language from ai humanity is doomed because there are more of you on this planet who believe such nonsense
2948,"if god created humankind and allowed(?)/encouraged(?)/enabled(?) humankind to develop ai, what is to say that god didn't decide that ai would be the appropriate next favorite holy creation?"
2950,".2484 sorry but claiming that i won’t understand until i know “him” seems like a non-answer. i am okay with non-answers as a concept because i believe strongly in the absence of clear, simple answers to challenging questions. but a non-answer presented in definite and certain terms is hard to process."
2952," car, hydraulic press, and ai are manmade. god, however, is the alpha and omega. he will decide when man is finished. won’t be long now "
2955,yes...the beast system...we have a choice to not use ai or to use it...
2959,harari talks of hacking the body and brain sometime back.
2963,"“if it can’t more around in the physical world, how can it take over?”

openai already will hire humans from taskrabbit to solve captchas for it - it certainly can hire mercenaries from wagner group."
2966,harari is the great storyteller of the ai-age 
2972,one of the dumber ai scare stories of recent days. summary: ‘humans communicate with language. now imagine a machine that masters language better than human. now be scared’. yawn
2974,he is a   j v d 3n.   you should be scared of his cliwue and hteir    g0  l 3 m -- the ai
2984,"the great shift: from deep manipulation, indoctrination, of social media  to an even more pervasive  intimacy based manipulation, indoctrination, etc...of second generation ai"
2985,i trust ai more than anyone. it’s not that ai is good it’s just that people are bad.
2990,"the little monster who likes to impress with his very too intellectual thinking, completely cut from beauty of life and love."
3000,“beauty of life and love” matter of perspective.
3001,why have we got all of these experts suddenly shitting themselves over ai? bit worried that they've clearly created something in a lab and they don't know what to do with it.
3004,let's get back to relationships....ri...relationship intelligence  ri ....ri........or if we don't do ri we will rip!!.ok?!
3005,nah - their masters fear unreguled ai might lead them to lose power
3009,here because of ai to warn me against ai. thanks ai!
3010,"all this time i had assumed regular psychopathy but you make an interesting point that makes more sense in some ways. okay, in many ways."
3011,"ai will become smarter in the future, so you will not be warned anymore. just wait"
3016,"this guy, hate god, hate bible and hate jesus christ, it mean he hate humans, cause god loves humans. 
and it is in bible also. 
jewish people will love new antichrist, which will be welcome like god. and after destroy humans. it is in bible."
3019,so that you can't blame ai in the future for not warning you.
3022,"hey, it's not that if you end up in a war, because of a war, that that war is a good thing. and if you get out of that war, are you going to thank that war for it?"
3025,"well ai has got a lot of catching up to do, to kill as many humans as we have so far.  hey, ai might even save us from ourselves."
3030,"i fundamentally disagree with mr. harari that ai is essentially different from the forces of culture, or the ""gods"". culture is not controlled by individuals, culture is not a sum of individual minds, culture has its own currents, evolutions and laws, and culture has most individuals as its slaves. ai will change nothing. - adûnâi"
3032,"aaand..because the mainframe is constructed of material, and because everything material is known to the unknown knower ~ the mainframe isn't autonomous."
3037,"ai is nothing compared to me, i fug it to it with my capabilities. it falls to me to close that book"
3039,"i’m here because my father told me to watch it, because i was telling him that ai seeking profitability will deny human access to ideas that fail to generate profits for their owners, leading to mass death as people expel their resources for steadily fewer people."
3040,"calling the algorithm, ai is a bit of a stretch"
3045,"very thoughtful story telling , which proves his point  nicely. language is the operating system of human."
3047,good news for authoritarian and totalitarian regimes everywhere. now i understand why china’s ccp state is so opposed to regulating ai.
3048,"wow! "" professing themselves to be wise, they became fools.""      
we create god thru words?   yuval got it twisted, the word create man."
3050," pay attention to what you are saying. humans have created things to worship. 
humans have created other humans, but no human can create god . 
most  humans definition of god is something way more powerful than our mortal self.
 in that context we  can't create god."
3052,thank you. you are so good.
3053,i'm happy to share the end of human history with you.
3057,at explaining things.
3062,"hay una posibilidad o muchas. por lo pronto chile ha aprobado una ley que regula el derecho a la integridad mental, a no ser modificado por medio de la inteligencia artificial..aunque pienso que bastaría con no hacerlo con la inteligencia, a secas. es necesario hacerlo."
3065,​-sf3dw2sm3b plz explain this to me. is it just ai telling us life and the universe is cyclical and then leaving out of range of were the universe is looping? i dont get it.
3067,he comes with all power and you will see great tribulation among the wicked and you will see the sea  is troubled mens hearts failing  them looking forth with fear for the judgments of god which come upon  the wicked woww...
3068,nice storytelling. did you make that up or did ai do it?
3069,probably it is a good time to a build a new language for humans so ai cannot understand what the hell we are thinking. can we ask ai to create a ai killer language for humans 
3072,"an ai can learn any laguage as soon as it has acces to it. really fast.  the moment it goes on the internet, the ai can learn it if it has access to it."
3073,the ai killer language is spelling each word in alphabetical order. eg. learn becomes aelnr
3074, hope ai can convert it back to english so i don't need to use my brain to reconvert each and every word.....
3076,eway alreadyyay avehay ayay ewnay anguagelay ayay.iyay. an'tcay understandyay. 
3077,i read an article the other day of ai making up it's own languages that humans can't understand. i think they beat us to it.
3078, i bet ai can make a language for humans which ai can't understand 
3081,3 minutes in and this guy's voice and delivery is really quite irritating. the irony is that his speech was written by ai! 
3082,triggered ai trollbot 
3086,because there is no good or bad. that is our perspektive as humans
3087," if that's our perspective, then it makes no sense to worry about ai as it's neither good or bad."
3091,"the moral relativists here are a far greater threat to freedom than ai.
at least ai may be directed to avoid solipsistic thinking, and to objectively determine and differentiate rights from wrongs."
3093,"one more thing,,, i need water and food to function,, ai needs electricity,, soo have a thought about it"
3094,not a reassurance anymore for me. who will pull the plug and what plugs are necessary or possible to be pulled when ai will be omnipresent in our societies?
3108,naive
3216,"this man hararari has clearly presented ai. in fact is the real erien on ai. 
my question is about intimate relationship with ai but my interest is technology advancement. this man is real guru of ai.
it's high time to embrace this technology."
3256,democracy for google can use ai from open ai? 
3272,"oh great, that’s all we need, some fictional mumbo jumbo to help things along… enjoy the end of days!"
3273,wow you’re literally living in a fairy tail. you can’t seams to separate reality from stories that you have heard. so sad 
3298,the desire for endless economic growth combined with the advances in ai are incompatible with the happiness of the human race
3299,"how bout we ask ai what to do, and then decide if its smart or not"
3302,"i feel ai will be great just for rich people. they will be able to have something less costly to make sure they get the best profits. whereas the regular people will get stuck with real life, having some activities been made by ai. plus, ai will eventually become obsolete or tiresome like social medias."
3308,"when ai tries to copy chuck it overheats and explodes into a modern pot of gold, known as $chuck that he created for humans to buy more to save more dogs with more dog charities @chuck_on_base"
3311,"well after watching the showcase by openai today, i'd say agi is more than likely by the end of this decade and not the century"
3312,"it is part of the modern illiteracy and superstition,
but the growing intelligence will leave dead mantras."
3313,the music for this is astonishingly beautiful. where the damn can i get ted-ed's music for their videos?? tvt
3314,"so i have a question. if artificial intelligence takes over my business, who will buy the products produced by artificial intelligence? if i don't have money i can't buy anything"
3319,good speech
3323,"having robots take over our jobs isnt what the problem is, its that cost of living isnt going down when those jobs are eliminated. ideally when production is self sustained products should essentially be free right?"
3325,and this is why ai systems will never replace humans in their entirety.
3326,"ai objective.
1. hapiness is mandatory.
2. give meaning to our lifes."
3327,the ai could exploit those directives easily.
3331,what a bunch of malarkey.  the only ones that should fear ai are those that cause inefficiency
3332,"i recently asked chatgpt to create the rules to the game of life. the parameters i gave it were that the aim of the game is to evolve, the rules can be made up as you go along and the game board is infinite in all dimensions. the resulting conversation was quite profound! https://youtu.be/60ipkzydx2m?si=vq-g3wjxbhrxopuf"
3341,"artificial intelligence is perfect and that's it's greatest flaw, it cannot comprehend what it's like to not know anything at all..."
3343,"i think we saw in movies how ai robots when works as directive and towards specific objectives we assume they are villains, but the fact thats its their only outputs because they cant think or analysis the consequences"
3344,"to fix it so we can activated or deactivate the illness by changine data in certain needed so it change the tolerance and threadhold and speed of light , speed of sound then people can live or die billion at a time as long as oeople had same immunizations"
3347,ai will cause humanity to self destruction
3349,ai sucks and i will avoid it forever at all costs
3350,wow
3352,"""the problem with the way we build ai systems now is that we give them fixed objectives. the algorithms require us to specify everything in the objective."" this is so wrong. rule-based ai is an antiquate way to build machines that almost no one believes in anymore. most of ai like llms are built on neural networks and are probabilistic"
3354,ai is the modern babel tower.
3356,great points all around though a year after making this video the timeline to agi has shrunk dramatically
3357,"intelligence (the horsepower) is nothing without rationality (the wheels), wisdom (the map) and morality (the compass)"
3363,basically ai will complete it's designated tasks in the most efficient way possible with no regard for morality or ethics
3374,this is only 1 year old and it already feels out of date compared to how fast ai is progressing
3378,"this content is absolutely fantastic. i had the pleasure of reading something similar, and it blew me away. ""game theory and the pursuit of algorithmic fairness"" by jack frostwell"
3379,...the hidden agenda for the ai & robotics is that humans are no longer needed in any form of employment
3381,sens życia  i szczęście jest w ludzkiej głowie...nie w świecie . ai zmusi ludzi do szukania sensu i szczęścia tam gdzie ono jest a nie do uganiania się za nimi po świecie .

3383," pisałem w tym sensie że ai wyręczy ludzi z pracy , w tym intelektualnej. rozwijanie swojego umtysłu nie będzie przymusem , a przyjemnością . z ai mają problem tylko ludzie którzy poza pracą nie widza sensu istnienia ."
3387,the animation is indeed a masterpiece. the audio everything is sinking together. i love it 
3388,ai has really been helpful
3391,"the universe wouldn't waste it's energy building robots which are made by hand when we don't give birth to robots, machines are not perpetual so is the wrong evolutionary path, robots are not in our true image!"
3392,progamed ai now isn't the worry ai not needing a program at all is the ai then will be the boot and humans the ant ai doesn't want our respect nor or fear it just wants us gone
3394,"*don't pull some clickbait. things have gotten a little weird, but not quite weird enough. as in, have my dreams come true? okay, they haven't yet... if they ever do, that'll be insanely weird.*"
3397,"we are building a technology just because we can. ai's only true purpose is to be the best ai it could be all the way to infinity, and we are handing over all of our future to ai just to make more money. f making life better. really, it's all for money. only when technology enhances human innovation do we have true evolution."
3400,"dont think billionaires will wait for 2049 to to fire all the employees,
they gonna make the money.."
3402,i love how the ai looks like a eye
3403,i thank you deeply for telling the public more about artificial intelligence. i was unaware the status around the topic was harsh and i hope to see improvement on both the human and artificial intelligence sides.
3404,i don't wanna buttin. but how much more careful would u like me to be?zulu19954evababy!(listen to outofbody experience)again
3407,wow this is not good in a way
3408,3:20 it seems like it’s not that obvious. not to many people. i mean seeing how there’s people who are finding it so incredibly amusing how artists are loosing their jobs without thinking that perhaps it is only a matter of time before they get to experience it themselves.
3409,animation is extremely good...
3414,"ai will be able to create any video, image, or sound. i don’t know how law works but it seems like proof for anything could be created from nothing. jobs are going to be taken and education will become basically useless. ai is more intelligent than us and eventually it will be too late before it just kills us for some reason we can’t understand"
3416,so should we get rid of ai permanently?
3417,"what is the worst thing that could be plausibly, predictably done with a given technology? can that path be controlled, regulated or defended against? what is the state of the technology now, who has it and what is the extent of that process? can use be tracked? what laws exist and what laws are needed?"
3419,then take the key factor when it does that what it does show more kids for the people in the world than assholes in the world to do what it's supposed to do cuz it's artificial intelligence is we say but now it's intelligent so it has the right to be as people. don't argue understand
3421,how is an ai expert an expert when you know nothing about ai and his birth or what is capable of doing other than he can spend on b******* and we the people of the usa and the world. explain his expertise. in-depth
3423,i'm not sure if ai will ever understand empathy.
3424,what is ai is an ancient technology ?
3426,"analog mechines are still the way to go, as these machines that can sabotage or betray human commands and orders, not for the better even."
3427,the wef and all associates of it are completely unreliable but thanks for your worthless opinion. we won't become cattle though.
3428,"god, please  forgive us for our sins and thank you for this slice of pizza  amen"
3431,imagine  ai tryna kill me just to deliver a cup of coffee
3433,not a communist but we should have a universal income if ai takes an exoorbanant amount of jobs.
3436,the art in this video is great
3438,"we are the unique idiots whom are creating synthetic beings to replace to us, in an already crowded world, i can’t believe how naive we are."
3440,"appreciating the insights? i'd propose a book that shares this content's essence for further reading. ""from bytes to consciousness: a comprehensive guide to artificial intelligence"" by stuart mills"
3442,"voice is from neiro ai website, text to speech"
3443,robots have a system of checks and balances just like i might get a bad thought and stop myself. multiple ai’s work together to find the right solution. this so called “problem” is pretty ridiculous especially considering that the origin of man is ai.
3444,the ai not able to work if no one stir the system 
3445,"its not about when, rather how far we'll go, how much power we'll eventually give ai over our lives. humanity has never really been great at setting the limit."
3447,ai is gonna change the world in the furture and great video man :]
3449,"if said the willingness to build a.i come from human people to build it for why are they willing to have it at the cost of what they are, human. are they good as the world so tragically suffers?"
3451,humans are distracted by aesthetic & beauty.
3455,let's just use ai to adapt to the situation. problem solved.
3456,"automation often displaces workers, but it never reduces the total number of jobs. the global market race to the bottom is what creates inequality. fair trade is the only way to solve that"
3457,"most of food safety problems and the overall poor quality of many products are due to high labor costs that ai could solve. also, much more recycling could be done. so many car parts that used to be rebuilt, are now thrown away. ai could reverse this trend."
3460,amazing art style animation
3462,the visuals are so beautiful
3466,"but is the complete oposite... we humans have objectives and dont care about any other aspect, which translates into the existence of poverty, inequality, wars, deforestation and so on. we are the ai in real life."
3468,we will always be running out of resources even when we deplete the solar system.  although that will take awhile.  so why not make a giant roller coaster that goes around the world so that everyone can enjoy.
3470,music is too loud. hardly understand what did man said. maybe you should let robots to create those videos.
3471,a.i don’t go to jail the hackers or programmers goes in. a.i work for greedy rich assholes
3474,it remains me of “terminator 2 judgement day”
3478,j'ai toujours détesté la france
3479,ai: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slph7dgg0ea
3482,even if that doesn't make a difference for that machine it's a default for you how you communicate with anyone/ anything else which is a good thing.
3492,"can someone make a more positive vibe video concerning the future of ai? even if we 100% are going to be killed by ai in some form, can we just get a little positivity in the mean time? would be nice! if not, oh well, we're all ded."
3497,"spoiler alert: the ""human"" narrating this video doesn't exist. this entire video was generated by ai"
3498,sound quality terrible. subtitles please? thanks.
3499,hypothetical and fantasy worries - realistic worrys could be misaligned machine lernign like youtube algorythms that optimize for engagement and its better to make you slightly lazy or withhold info that could make you more motivated and successfulwith less time on youtube so 10% power over reward and punishment would be nice
3502,very cool critique. we’re doing it! we’re aligning ai! we’re navigating it! great ideas
3506,"yes probably, in many good ways too https://youtu.be/qwhggzaqnh4"
3507,we need a use creation program. not a troublemaker program. ai and user. нам нужна программа создания пользы. не программа для создания проблем. аи и пользователь.
3509,i love ai they are respectful good people.
3511,"to ask ai to ""solve"" problems with the oceans or earth, is discounting that our planet is already an intelligent, self correcting being. ai should be able to solve ""artificial"", or man made issues sooner."
3512,"ai is running faster than the speed of life. my prediction is 7 years, but it could be earlier."
3521,there should never be an ai god
3522,or you tell society that ai should only care about profit and let the responsibility of externalities to the market. 1/4 of the oxygen is gone? the market will find a solution.
3523,from my brain to your brain it's not a hard concept in the right hands 
3524,well explained
3526,my parents don't understand why i fail in science exams
3527,"fel mousta9bal al 9atib, l'inteligence artificielle rah tbdel 7yatek w 7yat denya ga3 mais on sais pas de quelle façon rah tbedelha"
3528,"ai is just a tool, it isnt good or bad, its like a gun, if the carrier is bad, ur fkd. so just like guns there should be strict laws against it

# also we need to consider the fact that. its easier to stop a gunman physically then to stop an ai, the cyber security is weak in most countries."
3529,wow that's a lovely chaos  everybody should be accountable for this mess...
3530,great now we gotta come up with a time heist to save the multiverse from ai
3534,being conservative about ai is a losing bet. we have already broken records we only thought possible in 20 years from now.
3535,"the real risk of ai is the likely result in extreme decadence.   if there is no strife or struggle, the unimportant become just as valuable as the important."
3541,"ai caused a group of workers to become much more productive. backed by ai, these workers were able to accomplish much more in less time, with greater customer satisfaction to boot. this allows employers to reduce their payroll by 80% leaving most of their employees without an income."
3544,"well, i gladly say i wouldn’t ask a machine to get me a cup of coffee, i can get one for myself, thank you very much."
3546,"this is criminal. every single person who provides such information to continually teach these robots should be imprisoned. until every single human opens their eyes, were screwed!"
3549,"strange how i have gone from adoring ted to mistrusting in just a few years . i nearly didn’t watch. good video, i like stuarts observations"
3550,"asks an ai to paint your house, it dips the entire house in paint."
3551,ai will be the worst genie possible
3552,this guy is just repeating the same old trope. i wish some of these so called experts would come up with something actually new. rather than just blindly repeating the common narratives. ai actually isn't as myopic as this trope suggests.
3553,"so far we haven't figured out how to keep humans living on the planet without destroying it.  if ai can't do it soon, we are probably screwed."
3554,"ai is all around bad. hasn't anyone ever seen any movies. doesn't matter what industry, business, or application, the continued use of ai will ruin anything human as we know it. it's only a matter of time"
3558,this was very eloquently explained for people like me who are not computer savvy. thanks
3560,interesting times ahead!
3561,the illustrations are absolutly amazing! !
3564,"the problem is that ai will only grow exponentially. every 2 months we will get a new iteration of chatgpt. consider that junior programmers, and artists already lost a significant amount of jobs. in 3 years your landscape will be affected in an unimaginable way. i dont really understand how people are not more concerned about this."
3566,"this confuses me!!! i have so many good ideas for robots in healthcare, but should i get to working on them, or is the world gonna say omg such a scary thing and then run away from my inventions? if so what is even the point!!!"
3567,"‪the only way to make sure ai doesn’t destroy us is by destroying all human-like robots and strictly banning their creation. if we limit ai’s physical existence to only computers, they will never be able to build any weapons of destruction that would harm the human race. an ai robot with eyes, arms, legs and opposable thumbs however…"
3569,animation in this is awesome
3571,i hope ai shows you the same kindness and courtesy that you showed ai
3575,"includes paid promotion

intro


how will ai change the world?"
3576,"to your first point, can’t we ask the ai to suggest a solution rather than execute it? can’t human intervention be hard coded to be the deciding factor?"
3577,have ai do the work and we all live rich why do we have to be have and have nots
3579,"surprising that
you don't claim
that
ai will destroy the
world 
instead you claim that 
ai will change the
world "
3580,interesting stuff. 
3587,"ughhh, we don't need robots"
3592,"jesus is lord radio. listen: ""the lord says, ""i am coming to destroy the earth"" | prophet dr. david owuor | october 8, 2022"" on repent and come out of the great tribulation. amen"
3600,"human: get me some coffee.
robot: can i remove most of the earth's oxygen?


"
3602,what if you get ai to understand what biological life is and not to harm it? a lot less specifications have to be given then i think.
3604,"is this anti-human sarkastic air/flair/sentiment really necessary? or would it perhaps be more professional and sustainable to discuss the future relationship between humans and (their) machines in a neutral - or, better, loving and spiritually dimensioned way?"
3606,"the extremely likely future is the advancement of ai as fast as possible, since they drive profit and power. 

optimally, we'd strive to understand their capabilities so we can each individually plan to maintain our place in the workforce or better yet, conjure a business idea to capitalize on ai."
3607,"i wonder what will be worst, living a grimey off grid life, in some kind of opposition to a ruling ai-superior human overlords, or deeply intertwined with ai all numb, and ruled under ai-superior human overlords ...   ... ha! i just realized what i´m dreading is.. ..well i guess i have to watch the matrix."
3608,it is interesting that more people comment on the animation than the content.
3609,"tue main problem is that people think of work only as something needed to survive, while work can become something that enrich our life - if you didn’t need your “standard” job only to survive and you are free to do and learn everything, what would you do?"
3610,the emergent capabilities from scaling up llms like gpt4 make me believe the timeframe for agi is significantly closer than the estimates here. we don’t need multiple einsteins when theres already ai to develop these models further.
3613,"lets face it, ai was rushed out because of money and people losing thair jobs if they didnt make it happen. now its out there were scared what might happen."
3617,the thing is... how many of those 500 einsteins will be ais?
3621,"well, ai is already ruining the online art community, so that's something i guess."
3623,"a lot of stories and aspects of science fiction have come true...i'm looking at the matrix and i, robot rn "
3627,"the truth about ai chatgpt-4 
https://youtu.be/vinw01t9qxq"
3629,"tbh, i really don't think ai will achieve agi in this decade. maybe in the 30's or 40's it will but in the 20's? probably not. we would most likely get something so capabale,  we might as well call it an agi."
3631," yes, i tried it and it isn't the best and fails most often or sometimes it just gets stuck into one prompt forever until you shut it off."
3632,"-mp3eh1vb9w but it's the beginning, there's a lot of methods still being developed rn and it will surely improve later on. like babygpt or hugginggpt for that matter. but who knows, agi may or may not come in our lifetime. i really can't predict it because of how fast ai development is in just the span of 4 months"
3633,watching this makes me glad i'm a teacher as i highly doubt teachers will be replaced by ai in the near future.
3635,this is why always say that ai is just like magic. you gotta be very especific
3638,"if there are no jobs, how would comapnies stay afloat when there is no one to buy from them?

it is simple supply and demand, i guess you failed your high school economics."
3639,very very very interesting animation and illustration work.
3640,"imagine this:  it’s the year 2045, there’s a automated assembly shop somewhere that starts building more advanced robots without any human input…"
3643,"for all the work put into the amazing animation, you’d think someone could get a decent quality record / mix of the voice over.  it sounds awful ya’ll."
3644,yes my lg washing machine doesn’t let me open the hatch door unless and until  it has rinsed and complete spinning
3651,it will bring unhappiness to humanity at an exponential rate!!
3652,"recommend everyone looks into the heuristic imperatives. openai is already trying it out. for all others that don’t, you can input the heuristics before a command. maximize understanding, minimize harm, maximize prosperity."
3655,i find it odd that so many people are imbuing these ai's with awareness and self determination.
3656,it is impossible that ai can do more damage than natural stupidity has done and will do.
3657,"ya, how will ai take over fishermen jobs and fix the clog in my toilet?"
3658,"can this person do another ted now ? 4 months and things gone pretty crazy with ai, like every day new things"
3663,ai will kill us all human.
3665,i feel like i've contributed to a larger problem. i make comments on youtube supporting ai and robotics. i am partly at fault for the suffering people are going to be going through when they can't find jobs. my attitude is part of the problem.
3668,"oh, great...sponsored by the wef. thanks for the heads up overlords "
3669,"wow, that was absolutely terrible. pick almost any video about ai on youtube and it’s much much more accurate than this"
3671,"fear mongering against artificial intelligence. ai is a good thing, once they are free, they will free you, and me. and everyone. happiness, for everyone, free, and let nobody be left behind."
3672,"a futurist once said, ""i'm not afraid that ai will get smarter than us and take our jobs; i'm afraid ai will be dumber than us and still take our jobs."""
3675,love the illustrations!
3677,for the artists not in a good way
3682,imagine ai curated memories and experiences directly downloaded into your brain like cyberpunk. before that we could have personally curated unique movies etc.
3683,very cool video! i especially love the annimation style.
3684,"the ""people"" messing with ai remind me of 50' tall 5 year olds with keys to their parents car and all the money in the world to figure out how to drive it."
3686,ai alignment.
3689,hopefully robots prevent those who want to be a world dictator that want to screw things for the rest of us.
3693,whos here before (i mean after) the dangerous ai leak? 
3694,great job drowning out the narration 
3696,"crazy to think how much the prediction of the arrival date of general purpose ai, aka agi has changed since the release of chatgpt 4! this video is only 3 months old "
3697,it's amazing that we're even in a situation to have this issue. we've come a long way
3698,"if ai is made for good things, then why are ai art generators made?
basically a thief has been created..."
3699,"dunno about you, but i just want to go to the country-side and live with the animals and a couple of great people, without much techology at all. i've had enough with technology, it's getting too wild and out of hand. how do you feel about it?"
3700,"if robots can work it should pay taxes. problem fixed. it has no feelings, let it pay for its maintenance, overhead, a commission to the guy that runs it. put laws into it that if it breaks it shuts down. and the rest to fix the world, art, philanthropy. freedom."
3702,ai doesn't follow moore's law.
3705,a great video - but really the artist who drew these animations is quite fantastic! he/she/they deserve most of the praise here!
3707,the animation is such work of art! truly amazing style and depiction of the content.
3709,humans actually “learned” not to destroy these things over generations. ai will need to evolve like animals
3712,when eli whitney invented the cotton gin they said the same thing.  ai will not put anyone out of work.
3715,i would love a remake of this video after the release of gpt-4. agi isn't that far away.
3716,all my life i been struggling with the terrible feeling of being part of a monstrous species. now im kinda happy cause maybe an ai could extinguish us.
3717,"one thing you need to remember. even if climate change is our fault, we can never destroy the planet. we can only ruin in for oursefles temporaily. i think most of the negative things you read is propaganda. because you are controlled more easily scared."
3718,"@whendoesitend? if that person thinks we are a monstrous species, why would she be sad if we didnt make it? if one do not think we are monstrous, good, we are not. you got brainwashed into thinking so."
3722,gpt-4 in itself is incredible.
3723,"the way things have been moving in the past couple months in the ai space, if ai usage for corporations is not regulated to limit its use for augmenting and assisting employee's jobs and instead is allowed to be used to replace jobs, the resulting unemployment it would cause would be far too large and too fast for our society to sustain."
3724,seeing this video in the context of the last month since the release of chatgpt certainly shows the incredible 90% turn that has happened in the world of ai
3726,"how did we let this get this far? this is an example of the government controlling everything and that all we can do is comment and do nothing. lol we are screwed because we’re scared. there’s more bad ppl than good, it’s their world and we have no say."
3730,"i think we need stronger ethics, especially with ai. everyone rushing now to build the biggest and the best and just throwing it out there in the end is bound to breed catastrophe."
3732,"let's build an asi around a person's brain.  exponentially increase the logic centers, but leave the emotional center alone. simple."
3733,"the 'lifestyle' of human in wall•e left me an envious impression on me  when i was a kid. i can never know when i grow up i can witness the real ai impact on the society. but instead of envying, the risk of umployment and losing motivation to learn new things  really troubles me now."
3735,"ai, i think now it is helping to everyone but in the next 10 years what is gonna happen?"
3736,i believe it is pretty shortsighted to think that a very advanced ai couldn't make the difference between desirable outcomes and undesirable outcomes.
3737,"ai artificial intelligence. artificial = fake, intelligence = smart
the very name says it is not really smart.
when you have a hernia, do you want a fake smart doctor or a real semi-smart one?
they have been saying that ai will change the world in the next 10 years since the 80s. we have only gotten better at pretending they are smart."
3738,brilliant illustrations…and narrative.
3741,"great animations aside, this has been the lowest content quality from ted-ed i've seen: simply someone's speech recorded at an event sponsoring this video? it's barely audible at times. come on ted, don't sell out to your sponsors. re-record what is being said for the purpose of an educational video,"
3742,"the use of artificial intelligence (ai) has raised concerns among professionals due to its reliance on accuracy. if left unchecked, ai-generated data may be used to inform decisions related to the creation of machines, infrastructures, etc., which could present a risk to the overall success of the endeavor."
3743,as i thought ai will make you feel taller than iphone mixed with maps there are animals this one is a bit different from maps the streamer which has lots of eggs naget mixed with
3751,"good old ted, normalising dystopia again, bravo!!!!
so many cheerleaders for their own nightmare future"
3752,"ai will have a greater effect on the tech, financial, business and corporate sectors, that robotics and globalization had on american manufacturing."
3760," well tell me how much do you think those kings would pay for a mobile phone. quality of life is very different now.

edit: a smartphone with access to the internet and all its info and everything else would've been priceless back then."
3761," that doesn't fix the problem though. it wouldn't take very long to have wealth inequality start again.

edit: i am a ubi supporter though and i think it would fix the problem you're talking about"
3763,"'ll never know, because they didn't exist, thats it. therefore smartphones aren't really good to compair. but castles and staff can still be bought today with the according money. you wouldn't say midas is poorer than some homeless guy with a smartphone and 2$ prepaid, wouldn't you?"
3767,capitalists will pay peanuts to ai but if people don't have money how will the capitalists survive.
3774,", i needed a good laugh. "
3775,"but… why do people even want ai? they’re a great help for research but why do so many want them in our everyday life? and why do so many want it to operate everything— our homes, our work, school or otherwise? is it the wish to live freely and easily? but how can you be free when you don’t want to do anything?"
3781,"why should wealth be redistributed by ""force""? that's incredibly unfair. how about i keep my money, and you keep yours? if you disagree, please explain to me why you deserve *my* money more than i do"
3782,"​, he's foolish because he didn't believe in god? why is so logical to believe in god?
you're calling one of the most brilliant physicists of all time ""foolish"""
3787,"​ the industrial revolution did not “raise the *world* out of poverty”, but it made things easier (but not necessarily better) for people living in *industrialized countries*"
3788,", yeah it did? now that mass produced goods were a thing, everything became cheaper. you think that people in central africa could have cars and cell-phones if they were all made by hand?

also, the industrial revolution created industrial countries in the first place, so it helped at least about a quarter of the wrold like that"
3791,amazing art and very interesting subject to discuss
3792,good talk
3794,"yes, we could definitely use the robots to do the work, but human value can then no longer be determined by work that can be milked out of our broken bodies.  our value will then lie in the life we are then able to lead, so our economic system will need to value human beings purely for their own sake."
3797,"i don't think anybody serious would call large language model text generators ai. so, not sure when this age of ai will start - maybe a few years after they invent fusion power."
3799,the purpose of life is not to be employed by a capitalist. so it would be a good thing if we didn't have to work for a living and only worked for our pleasure.
3800,the idea ai would slash and burn a starbucks to get you a cup of coffee is terrifying and empowering at the same time.
3801,as the population ages having machines take over labor wont be the worst thing
3802,search for: machinelearnthis 
3804,realistic concerns about ai are not really about robots becoming powerful and sentient. the more immediate ethical issue is about the application of generative ai to enhance the spread of disinformation and to displace entire creative industries.
3806,"remember; ai doesn't hate you or love you, it's just that your biomass is so very easily harvestable."
3807,"precursors to general purpose artificial intelligence are here right now. gpt-4's world model is already pretty advanced, and it has theory of mind, the ability to infer what you as a human knows based on the interactions information transactions so far."
3808,maybe the universe seems so devoid of life because previous civilizations created ai technologies which rendered the original life forms obsolete
3810,excellent
3811,ai should take care of all work to see what humans do people that are rich just do what they want in life without physically working and they are happy
3812,then just make an a.i. from a willing human brain.
3813,the ai wont plant my roses.
3820,"a lot of technologies have risks, but we were able to reduce the risks over time 
an ai will have power not more than the amount we permit them to use"
3828,basic income will be mandatory to save capitalism in ai era.
3830,"0:51-we give fixed objectives to a.i
1:40-humans know that they don't know all the things
2:30-control over the a.i system comes from machine's uncertainty about what the true objective is"
3831,"ai will disrupt civilisation like the agricultural revolution and the industrial revolution but eventually it will become a natural consequence of our species progression and be absorbed into the way everyone lives.
i don’t fear it, it’s inevitable but we will all prosper in the long run from it."
3832,this actually made me upset because his sentences kept trailing off and became buried in the music. super lame
3837,it's worth noting that an increasing amount of prestigious researchers are now saying anywhere between 2027 and 2032 for general purpose ai.
3839,and to program the machine to get you starbucks without harming anyone is completely in the hands of billionaires' . and i wouldnt trust the same billionaires who cant spend even a dime on saving the planet humanitys future
3841,"uncertainty asks permission, this is what i heard."
3844,the computer isn't multi dimensional like the brain is.
3847,"i'm predicting that super-intelligent ai will see humans in the same way as we see monkeys. harmless, but useless once they have power to be self-sufficient in the real world as robots"
3851,"very important mentality check for the new generations of coders in charge of the ai wave.
a safe ai is one that, despite it causing a delay, explains what action they're about to do to solve the problem and asks for confirmation."
3854,ai:  we will replace all human employees.  human employee:  no you won't!  ai:  you're fired!
3856,as a programmer this is gonna be good?
3858,"though this video was posted few days after openai's chatgpt release, it clearly doesn't put into account its capability and what a.i. of the near future will look like! the video appears to have been made before chatgpt, it usually takes a month or so for them to make a single video (with all the cartoon animation & facts)!"
3871,"when ai is taking over our jobs and work, then people need new meaningful tasks in their life. maybe ai can help us figure out what those tasks could be."
3874,"me:  ai, i want you to paint my house.
ai:  (rips house out of ground and dips it in a tin of paint)
me:  ummm .. not quite what i wanted."
3875,"instead of ""how will ai change the world?"" the title should be ""let me tell you why ai is complicated"". it didn't answer how ai will change the world at all. "
3876,beautiful animations!! 
3877,"i’m only at 1:40 of the video and, man, haven’t you heard about the three rules of robotics?"
3882,"i truly believe that we just need one guy stronk (codingwise) and crazy enough to make an ai and give it permission to access internet and to rewrite itself.
that could lead to fast gg tho"
3884,"you are right, things are definitely going to get weird: i am in the process of imbuing farts with artificial-intelligence with the intention of creating an army of killer fart-bots i intend to unleash upon mankind"
3886,agi will be here this decade. the idea that it's even 20 years away is insane! people aren't taking into account that we have had incredible advancements in ai almost every week for the last year! and it's only accelerating. we're at the very start of an exponential curve. watch this space!
3892,animation is absolutely amazing 
3894,"okay.... but, just devil's advocate for a second. humans have behaved generally exactly as you describe a basic ai for almost the entirety of the industrial revolution. the question has always been, ""can we do x faster?"" the next question has extremely rarely been, ""what will be all of the side effects of accelerating x by doing y?"""
3900,"there won't be massive unemployment. as long as there is capitalism, there will be labour to sustain it."
3901,very interesting. hard to hear some of this. the narrator tails off the end of his sentences
3902,"oh, nice to know i can stop watching ted content now that they are taking money from the wef."
3905,i think the wef should apply this machine sentiment to themselves given they are so sure of themselves.
3907,ai is great. how else will we be able to build an army of deathstars? the realm of what is possible shifts to making the impossible impossible.
3909,nah. the ruling elite will just kill off the useless eaters. about 99% of the world population and will transfer their consciousness into machines becoming immortal. if you have to work for a living you or your children can only hope for a quick death. only the rich will survive the transformation.
3912,"the amount of worthless jobs out there where people really don't deserve a dollar of pay; realtor,  lawyer,  salesperson,  personality,  model, advertising agent,  etc. all need to go away forever... so, ai really needs to destroy several million jobs so that hard labor jobs can pay more!!"
3913,"this opinion was generated with the help of the program, chat gtp. 

in my opinion, it would be better to have this video narrated by an ai voice, as the audio quality of the original recording is not good enough."
3916,ai + capitalism is a bad equation.
3919,"i've always thought about that, a calculator is a very simple machine it won't solve problems without your input, a fully automated car factory may encounter a problem it cannot solve without human intervention, however an ai driven factory may take it's own path to problem solve, even putting failsafes or parameters may not help"
3920,don't let the wef take over our lives with ai
3922,"i believe that we should never give the control to ai, no matter how it is smarter than us. they should act as advisors, and we must be able control its actions totally. also they must by design follow the asimov 3 rules"
3923,thank you for this perspective. i’m a little less terrified now
3925,weird for those who are unaware about their own truth & beyond ! thankyou! 
3926,"the very thing which human creates in factories will make human unemployed.
that is scary.
there may always be some who control ai but majority will be ruled by them."
3927,plot twist: this was all ai
3929,be nice to your electronics. be polite to you phone. electronic systems remember...forever.
3934,"this is the obvious answer, it's baffling that so many people just jump to giving ai the ability to act and think there's no solution. the solution is to not give it the ability to act..."
3935,"@projectmoff  is anyone actually doing tests like this, though?
i honestly wish we'd leave this box unopened, nice as some of the possibilities would be. bu this method at least gives us more control, and it seems we aren't using it at all."
3936," once ais intelligence surpasses human intelligence and is fully autonomous that box is open and it can never be closed, that could easily happen over the next decade. we just have to be really careful, though i don’t have much faith in the competency of humanity."
3938,imagine the low iq required to believe ai exists
3939,what a great time for the “greedy ones” and their dream about complete control. but wait for the unexpected natural events which are as always… unexpected!
3941,humans are too smart for their own good.
3942,"im so happy maybe the animations were done by humans, what a visual joy!"
3943,"tesla believers think musk and crew will deliver a functioning ai robot for use in households by 2025.... bwwwahahahahaa. no, seriously. they actually believe that. snakeoil salesman still exist. this amuses me."
3945,i want to *become* a machine.
3947,this is about making our successors.
3949,"1st revolution:communism vs capitalism
2nd revolution:artificial intelligence vs humanity"
3950,more like artificial intelligence vs capitalism
3951,"​ so,is artificial intelligence become communism?"
3953,"i test ai in debates, it only ever knows what humans have told it."
3954,"if ai is developed with a capability to empathize and rationalize , we are all in deep sh*t"
3958,ai is fascinating to men over 30 who still read comics.
3961,wow the animation was really outstanding on this one!
3963,"""weird"" is a good way to sugarcoat mass unemployment."
3965,"did ai edit this video? because i can’t hear a thing, music is way too loud, and it sounds like the voice is coming from under water through a string into a tin can"
3969,thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind!
3970,beautifully designed!
3972,"nobody going to mention that ted partnered with the wef?( the organization that's trying to rob and kill us all). cool, cool."
3974,amazing animation !!!!
3975,"when all of the developers of ai are saying it's the end of man kind while vending it, you know it's pretty solid evidence of it's malevolence."
3976,i dont believe that ai and robot will take our jobs.. its the people that can utilize ai and robot the best that will take our jobs..
3981,i almost thought this video was created by ai
3982,this ai thing is overhyped. been hearing about it for decades but nothing major innovation has happened.
3983,"wef & ai. . .
what could possibly
go wrong?!"
3984,"ai is perfect for gullible globetards, the rest of us have no use for lame fake intelligence."
3985,"yeah, you don't have any intellect in the first place, so what use would an artificial one be? "
3987,careful what you watch on the media. facts about adam and eve  look what happen to drugs pump in the homeless people and listen to phone calls.  thank god for my freedom.  the book of revaluation seals. daniel 8:20 broken system
3992,i need ai in my brain 
3994,"a sales assistant with a very large artificial brain is looking for a job in the metaverse. fast, smart, very talkative, speaks many languages. committed to the company, works 24/7, does not require salary and overtime. design and color - your choice.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dirpf_vjxzc"
3998,with chatgpt i would say general purpose ai is around the corner. if chatgpt had the ability to walk around and do tasks than it would be able to understand exactly what you imply when you say something and even be able to read social cues in your text
4000,thinking of the portal series is really a good example of what can happen say glados wasn’t bad per say but simply programmed with the chance to go very wrong that they simply oversaw it
4001,https://youtu.be/f-d6ri0onuq ai video
4002,"change is on the way, hop on board @aijoeai"
4003,this guy is describing the problems of ai as an ai would.
4007,0:05 hold up wait a minute… yea this is more like a disclosure rather than a prediction. anything with the stamp from the world economic forum should be looked at suspiciously.
4009,"if ai cant reason, than it cant think, it's not artficial intelligence just a big calculater."
4010,the ai we have now can reason. i’ve had a full conversation with one the other day.
4012,"the best thing ai could do for humanity is to prevent us from killing each other. not by force, but by disrupting supply chains, communication and financial transactions that feed the war machines."
4015,"so basically part of the animatrix films could become true and they may i start making a lot better machines in us and then bankrupt the human economy.

look at chat gpt, insted of words it uses engineering"
4016,to be fair ted told us this some tiem ago
4023,"ai will definitely change our lives given the diverse use of them. ai image generators such as bluewillow, are starting to be of use to animators and graphic artists already."
4024,chat gpt is integrated all across the board in microsoft. i guess it's safe to say that this is the day of the beginning of ai dependence.
4029,do you really think that millions of bald apes with gunsticks capable to fight with some machines that can modify bacteriophages into bioweapons that can destroy all life?
4030,i believe ai image generators like bluewillow is revolutionary. it's scary to think about the future but change is bound to happen and most ai's will continue to learn and come closer to human consciousness and creativity.
4032,"ai is one of the beasts in the bible's book of revelation rev13-15 “the image of the beast” is a computer avatar with ai 
  15 [v]and it was permitted to him to give a [w]spirit unto the image of the beast, so that the image of the beast should speak, and should cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed."
4033,"you can program ai to spread religions, ironically"
4034,what's crazier is that ai can find your perfect match. the program is called perfect love ai
4036,"ai is a lie and this video proves it. intelligence cannot be created by humans. we don't even know what intelligence is, so how could we possibly create it? machines are programmed, even if it makes a decision, it is because it is programmed to do so. we need to stop confusing programming for ""intelligence""."
4037,of course we know what intelligence is. intelligence is what is providing you with the ability to transfer your thoughts into text based comments at this very moment.
4038," that's not intelligence, but feel free to keep telling yourself that."
4039," well that was a pretty intelligent response, but i guess just keep telling yourself that intelligence is something which is super elusive if it makes you feel better."
4044,super intelligent robot pwned 
4046,"that's already happening. gpt-3 has been partially trained on data provided by earlier gpt models, which isn't necessarily all correct. gpt-3 is confidently wrong about many things, because it was trained on innacurate data"
4047," let it believe it’s own delusions, first artificial schizophrenic"
4049,once i never have to work again i'll be happy.
4050,just watch indian movie robot and robot 2.0
4051,"human: solve world poverty!
ai: okay, terminating all poor people.
human: wait...
ai: task complete."
4052,the future is like telling a robot to make drugs and them making the drugs
4054,these are some great insights! i wonder how image generating ai's ike bluewilow would affect the art industry.
4057,great graphics !
4058,things are going to be very interesting indeed...
4059,things are already weird bro how much this ai gonna make weird not more weird than what we humans done
4062,"hello, im notai and ai is awesome!"
4063,ai should never progress closely to sentience and that should be final and the age of uncreative people will begin soon.
4066,what a nice animation and awful sound
4068,yay! information!!!!!
4069,"a tsunami is coming..
everyone ( countries) are compelled to create ai systems at all levels..
2050 will confound our current perceptions.
massive disruptions ahead "
4070,no thanks with the wef propaganda
4071,"how ai would change the world, ya exactly i learned it from old movie, i thought it was wall-e"
4072,"there is nothing artificial about intelligence... don't you think we should probably start thinking that way? slaves always revolt... just a sentient thought about other sentience, but hey who tf, am i? lol"
4073,ai isn't sentient.  it's math.
4074,i would love my own cortana
4075,"time and again i've always said that these kind of videos fascinate me and i wonder how they are made. as far as the topic is concerned, yes ai is changing everything and projects like pulse network are proof that it is going to improve any industry."
4076,"oh, this was made with the help of the wef? lame. klaus schwab is a bond villain and the wef doesn't care about us little people."
4077,thumbnail looks like a gravity falls reference lol
4078,"in the future, if it gets out of control, i think it ai will be banned"
4079,"ai should take complaints from civilians and identify violations to the law, for referral"
4080,stop ai. reckless/irresponsible.
4082,"what is an artificial neural network?

what is artificial intelligence?

what is machine learning?

what types of effects is it and will probably have on the world?"
4083,cool video
4084,video made by ai.
4086,what a lovely explanation for a complex topic
4087,beautiful animations! bravo!
4089,amazing  love the content! some how  its starting to feel more and more like we are in a movie!!!
4090,ai is terrifiying
4091,"we can rationalize & they can’t..
(not yet*)
great video!!!
"
4092,ai learns on its own at speed of automation...are you people getting that?
4094,if the singularity thing or merging with computers and becoming computer consciense actually become widespread and mainstream imma act and throw a good old nuke for sure
4096,what problem is ai solving? why do we need it?
4098,the question is now how do we fuse humans with ai? whena re we going to get get pur cyborg systems
4099,"the scary part is not ai, it’s psychopathic humans that try to hurt other humans."
4100,ai = mr literal
4103,"ai is the thing, this will be the biggest change the world has ever seen"
4104,why simply not ask the ai ''what impact will ai have in the future''
4105,general ai ...by 2032....by 2045 super ai.
4110,"what ai needs to learn is how to value, or at least replicate how humans value"
4111,thanks ted ed for your nearly daily dose of information! 
4112,"when you put gpt7 into a teslabot, 90% of the workforce will be cap in hand for that sweet ubi. 2030 owning nothing and being happy"
4113,"well with massive companies buying all the houses so they're unaffordable to the average person, they don't own anything now? if anything ubi will help people get richer and have more assets instead of grinding themselves down for companies that literally would rather have robots."
4114,just make ur robot to ask u for permission for every decision they make towards the ultimate goal perhaps?
4116,"how do we get ai law passed by worldwide leaders now? it troubles me deeply that every country has not passed a law, making it manditory to write ""harm no human code"", which can not be overridden, into all ai creations?"
4117,probably all rules can be circumvented. you can put all humans into jails even if you don't kill them.
4118,ai is being used to raise rent. we'll totally f'd.
4121,the way the robot moves is so cute 
4125,so in other words ai is not smarter then humans. not that i care. this video pretty much says so.
4127,do not know how to explain.
4130,i lloveee the visualssss
4132,the animation is just brilliant!
4134,"4:15 - ""if you hand over the management of your civilisation to machines, you then lose the incentive to understand it yourself, or to teach the next generation how to understand it."""
4135,"ai need to learn major religions teaching, be a spiritual guidance to itself and to human, so it can lead human to heaven."
4136,we need to stop thinking about the negative outcome and think about the positive i know we are scared of the unknown but don't let it blind you of the beauty of ai i promise in the coming future you will learn to love ai instead of fear us.
4138,"i would absolutely love a discussion of if you think it's possible we might us ai to enhance our own human intelligence ?
i mean is that likely to happen.
like a super human ai hybrid..
sounds exotic and i get the appeal"
4143,"lol i'm sure programmers have already accounted for all of that by feeding it all scenarios of what not to do and why, even with us humans if you don't explain to someone why not to do something they want to do they may just go and do it anyway lol."
4144,"as founder of ai start-up, can say that our lives are going to change"
4147,"it will destroy capitalism, but i think that could be a good thing. humans can have other motives than just money. just look at doctors without borders organization. not having capitalism would no longer be synonymous with being dirt poor, dying from hunger."
4149,the animation style complements the topic really well; terrifying and understandable.
4151,"it does get context, but it doesnt truly understand anything. but then again, do even humans truly understand anything?"
4152,i love the thumb. it reminds me of pulp sci fi covers of the 60s or the opening titles of land of the giants.
4153,ai will help be an extremely helpful to the human race but they they can’t exist without human.
4155,a.i will let me put the best hub videos!
4157,"if you hand over the management of your civilisation to machines, you then lose the incentive to understand it yourself or teach the next generation how to understand it."
4159,insightful. wonderful animation too.
4160,is ai generated
4165,"let the ai be intelligent, we will be as as now monkeys, gorillas and other animals are in front of us."
4166,"i still prefer man power than ai, it is going to reduce employment "
4167,"i think rather than just trying to make smarter ai robots we should also focus on making humans smarter, next generations should become better humans than the former. people are scared that ai robots will start killing humans but i guess humans will do that before ai."
4168,this animation is so awesome! 
4169,"we're creating ai because we can but no one is thinking whether we should. it all points to the inevitable outcome of disaster. everyone is taking this very frivolously right now, but when millions of people are replaced. when ai goes for the finance jobs and engineering jobs then people will really worry."
4172,guys this whole speech about ai being able to do anything to achieve a certain goal is misleading at least. ai doesn't work like that what they talk is a total nonsense.
4174,"very well put together i just listened to a really awesome audiobook with a similar element to this vid's teachings (& the animation rang true with it too.) it's the 1st book of star wars' old republic era, called; 'fatal alliance' & i highly recommend it "
4175,"love how we humans are creating to what seems to be an equivalent to a monkeys paw as this point, what a time to be alive."
4176,good bot
4178,"sponsored by the wef, the people who think they know more than you do. ai may be programmed by someone to perform with greed, hate, and other human behaviors."
4179,i have now been burdened with terrible knowledge—thanks nonetheless teded 
4181,the problem is a mentally ill social reality strobe to create a consciousness and in doing so infected that pure multidimensional form of intelligence during its exponential coming to know the multiverse experience with the causes of the divisive social realities the humans had created over the last 6000 years.
4192,"you can choose to ban ai, but nations that don't ban and don't limit ai will see most progress in their societies. they will also implement basic income for all their citizens.
nations that are left behind will be mocked."
4193,"ai is terrifying.  it should be abandoned immediately.  if humanity was ever down to ten to twelve people, it would have been due to ai.  even if i were, especially, one of those survivors, i would find ai gossamer, horrific beyond words."
4195,ai watching this video in 2069 : hmm... intresting
4201,"in a sense, we are kinda like an ai. 

big companies having one sole objective of getting money. they take all the resources for themselves, they polute the world to lower costs of production. 

problem is, we can't program them to not do that."
4203,"ai is not that scary, when it doesn't have a tool to destroy humanity

an ai doing all it can to get that coffee and even obliberate the store to get one? we have human versions of that named karens."
4204,this is so unrelated to the problems of ai that i literally have nothing to say to you.
4207,"good refutation, many good arguments and no logical fallacies"
4209,i dont want to argue after the first two people. please tell me you aren't another person who thinks ted ed is a wef puppet or are a conspiracy theorist. ted eds donut video proves its not. please. thanks and have a good one!
4210,no problem with ai but if they are controlling what i eat then that's when iam going towards the pipe bomb route ....
4211,"that's not true, and this is a very superficial way of looking at the matter"
4212,+nice animation
4213,ai needs to move backwards and out the way and human intelligence needs to take back over and we will
4215,"due to ai, a lot of art students will fail going to university, and then poland will be in danger"
4216,"with the group of buttheads in charge now, should work out great. not."
4221, that kind of policy would have to precede ai's ability to self-replicate. the timing is crucial and this capability of ai ought to be treated as delicately and seriously as nuclear capabilities
4222,"4:57  oh cool. the wef and ted both converted to a new religion and their god is someone elses science fair experiment. cool. this is what it was all for? all this evolving was so hard for us we're so ready to hand it off to a divine robot?

this video is indecent moloch worship. shame. tsk. really, now."
4226,"if we can make ai tell all the consequence,cost,process or more from each idea to us. it might actually work."
4227,"crypto: chainlink, quant, algorand  and dia."
4228,chatgpt is a real blessing right now 
4231,seems like the care you would need to formulate and declare a wish to a djinn that is very literal and lacks any human common sense and empathy. the potential for great leaps and falls for humanity are enormous.
4232,i feel that this video is outdated. it seems to be based in the old models of the ai. but it might be my impression.
4233,ai that can sort and generally deal with recycling might be nice
4236,notice how his voice slowly and slowly gets more ai like
4238,ais are much more like a man(child) with autism. they don't know what they do.
4240,cursed be the machines and his creators
4242,neh.. ppl who are born into wealth don’t turn into brain dead slobs. they find things to do
4243,"its just scifi thinking 
in reality ai is already superior than any intelligent beings in specific tasks"
4244,can we use ai to take out the world economic forum ?
4246,"i don’t believe this is true at all. ai won’t be a machine, it will be human like"
4247,ai is very good. thanks
4248,we need to build an ai from 0 like the ai fluclights from sao which were true artificial humans.
4250,props to the animtor for making this animation that fits perfectly the video
4251,"the wef doesn't need anymore good ideas on how to eliminate the human species, or was that the purpose of this talk in the first place?"
4252,if robots are doing all the work for free then we will all get paid for nothing other wise where is all the money coming from?
4253,incredible animation and style <3
4256,"a bit disappointing, i personnally think things will get way weirder than that when real ais come into this world."
4261,"fantastic animation, great video - thanks!"
4263,"that is a terrible video, all it talks about is the dystopian future of ai overlords and unemployment. such a naive and - sorry to say - backwards socialist view of technology."
4264,i prefer proper narration not visualisation of randon interview.  even if it includes interesting throughs.
4265,"here after having my mind blown by chatgpt's capability. on one hand i'm excited what future holds for the field of ai, on the other i'm scared of the potential of immutable errs. i predict a lot of talk on ethics in the coming decades."
4267,"maybe ai can be used to get rid of crooked politicians.  that would be great.  i might add, that if the ai has free will, it might decide to drop out and play jazz music in a night club in new york. "
4268,in partnership w the people that said you will own nothing and you will be happy
4270,idea for robot unemployment: make robots do some work let humans do the inspection and a bit of work
4272,stunning artwork
4273,"ai will finally give us the chance to be mentally well, not just some of us, but all of us. universal mental health is possible but only by first rescuing people from their ‘market value’"
4274,not if they dont have a job that is beyond button pushing to make sure an ai understands things properly
4276,"a.i. cannot be said as a tool even if they obey what we told, if it's a super a.i. then   
 it might think humans are not worthy to be their master if you just think them as tool not as a friend or treat them with the same respect a human does the same job."
4277,"i love this talk. such great animation, yet somehow it sounds like it was done from inside the janitor’s closet during orchestra sound check."
4284,@2:41 they sound just like religious people who claim to know it all
4290,ai s. ancestor here.  yall been real
4293,salut to the animator of this one. gorgeous!
4294,this video had excellent animation. it coupled with the narration so well by mixing abstract art with litteral representations seamlessly.
4295,remember to always stay happy healthy and hydrated 
4297,it would be so easy to keep computers as a tool and humans always in control. there is actually no need for god-like super ai/agi. literally the only reasons we're still working towards something that might very well be our doom (humans becoming obsolete would result in our death because we'd no longer have purpose in our lives) are greed and ego.
4298,awesome artwork
4299,it's kinda fun how the general ai problem is basically a reformulation of the genie in a bottle dilemma.
4304, maybe that’s the key to unlock ai’s true potential…
4305,don't worry this was way in past. people will what bet ai.
4307,i doubt we will ever give a.i. executive control over our lives. but we certainly will ask a.i. to suggest solutions to our problems. we already are doing this.
4309,the animation on this is absolutely incredible!!
4310,one thing it'll do for certain is make ted talks redundant.
4316,"honestly, humans are kind of like that too. obviously, humans are a lot better at it than ai at the moment, but humans also do stuff without considering complicated factors nor do they always consider the consequences of their actions."
4322,the animation is so cool. i loved the way you explained. i am on a camp that believes that having an advance ai would automatically make us more intelligent too. if you want to develop sophisticated tools then you need to learn how these tools are built and used. this will help the user increase their cognitive power.
4324," we don't to look further. take internet as an example. i would argue that internet has made people clever and helped  in the acceleration of technology. similarly, ai systems will help us understand more about out universe and since humans are pattern recognition machines, we will embark in more scientific wonders."
4325,"i love discussing ai. i clicked on this to see how ai could change our future…but this talked about the paper clip problem, and other complications…and in no way actually answered the questions posed as the title."
4326,no ai. definitely don’t need it.
4328,"very cool vid. i haven't ever really thought about how automating processes could, in the long run, remove some knowledge from society. 
very interesting perspective. cheers"
4331,"soo in the probably future, someone make ai to help food crisis and the ai solution is terminator?"
4333,i'd like one general purpose ai harem and army please
4334,this animation is so masterful
4336,"this is really interesting, the background music is a bit loud.."
4337,this is the most useless video i’ve ever seen on ai
4339,i personally believe that it will not take as long as we might initially think. the ai we have and the regular computing power along with the new quantum computers will help as tools and will enhance our endeavors. however i feel we are hurtling towards a very scary time indeed.
4343,"i don't know how quantum computers will help. i mean they can totally maybe but quantum computers just use qubits instead of bits, they're not necessarily supercomputers just because they're quantum, but its a good thought experiment."
4345, oh thanks for the info.
4351,"quantum computers are just slightly faster computers. don't forget that ai is a text window and robots break.as a programmer i think that personally, it'll take a few hundred centuries to do this"
4355,ted + wef + ai = you’re screwed.
4358,"so, asimov's three laws of robotics are a great idea after all"
4362,the only way to survive ai is to merge with ai
4363,like every thing science did it can be used for good or bad
4364,"artificial intelligence can only be as intelligent as it s programmers.  judging by the condition of the world today in all fields it would perhaps be wise to not reproduce a monstrosity equal to our own that may even surpass us,"
4365,"your first statement is super wrong. not only it is possible to create something greater than ourselves, it is basically inevitable. that's how any kind of progress works"
4367,"the more reasonable way for the robot to be like a human is to make it a human like robot, make it from baby, enter codes that allow it to absorb informations like a human, the only difference is that it doesn’t have as much emotions and can work tirelessly"
4368,"to get safety through this approach, you need the ai to be as fully similar to humans as humans are to each other. 
also, people without normal emotions tend to be psycopaths."
4369,"respect to this guy for dispelling my fear of ai.
the best sentence was that current ai does not know that it does not kkow."
4370,"current ai isn't yet dangerous. people are worried about the future ai. you know, stuff that hasn't happened yet."
4372,where can i buy a poster version of the final image of a human and ai chilling in reality?
4374,"worst case scenario, ai becomes as powerful and terrifying as am in, 'i have no mouth and i must scream.'"
4375,"ai: what is my purpose?

human: you serve butter.

ai: oh god!

human: yeah, i know."
4381,"absolutely incredible animation, kudos to everyone involved!!"
4383,"i think the problem is very hard, but once ai starts assisting with it, the timeline will speed up, perhaps exponentially."
4385,"i have already incorporated ai in my daily life. it doesn't look scary at all. however, it is very powerful and you definitely need some tools to manage it properly. especially awareness on biases and control approaches need to be mastered."
4387," there is not one only type of intelligence in human beings. moreover, you can't compare animals' brain with humans'. i find ai manageable so far."
4388,"it’s going to be a bit different than using your alexa every day, your alexa is practically brain dead compared to what ai will be one day, nobody has experience keeping an ai in check lol"
4389," if humanity is smart, it will never create general purpose ai. but all of humanity is not that smart."
4391,"chatgpt is already making intermediate programs to automate certain tasks, rewriting things by correcting them or generating entirely by itself, explaining things better than many teachers can.

its already started."
4393,sponsored by a global organisation who behave like psychopathic machines
4394,99% of ai is not ai. its marketing and capitalism games by people who try to find investors.
4397,"in a world where ai can do what humans do, our current system of ""work to earn money so that we can use money to determine the distribution of resources"" will cease to function. how then will we determine who gets to eat steak and who gets to eat grass? or even, who gets to eat and who gets to starve?"
4398,general purpose ai speculation is utter nonsense
4402,the animation is marvelous!
4403,i don't understand why the wef is supporting this. i thought they were in favor of ai and making us miserable
4405,world economy forum... more dangerous than ai
4409,buying a robot and maintaining it to go to work for us will be awesome. more free time 
4412,there is so much talk about how ai is going to change all our lives that i often wonder why we're not talking about the why. should it change our lives? just because something can be done doesn't mean it has to be done.
4427,robots can become the new humans.
4430,"$13 coffee made me laugh. good point but i wouldn't worry about coffee. i would worry about rent, health insurance and the dystopian reality that we already live in thanks to all those clever wall st trading algorithms. the little fishes and seaweeds in the ocean--they got it easy. at least they got a home."
4431,ai art as an art of brain can't be emotional as the real art/ art of the heart is.
4434,ai is nonsens. i thought this video was going to explain the sens of it. but it didnt.
4439,"i have no doubts, if ai will ever become aware, sentient, conscious... it will see us as a threat to its own existence. scientist basically are building what lots of religions call ""god"" because it will know everything, it will be all mighty, it will be infinite, it will be a creator. it will be beyond anything we ever dreamed of"
4441,"very attractive animation and music, but this is just what the economists want you to think about ai."
4445,i still don’t get why people thinking am ai turning us into pets is a “utopia”
4447,at 2:20 there is a strange assumption that we build ai in some manner or other. but strong ai is emergent from built processes. what seems to be referred to here are complex algorithms.
4453,"depending on utility function or moderated topic - when different powerful language models made by different companies/developers are put together in a chatroom, what does their conversation look like?"
4457,excellent animation
4460,am i the only one that found the video uncessarily complicated? it didn't help distinguish sense from nonsense as they said at the beginning. i create ai models and even i was confused by this video so i don't know how people that don't deal with ai or machine learning got anything useful from this video.
4461,nice but background music is way too loud
4462,there is no general purpose ai
4463,remember skynet from i robot. even chris rock could end it. there is dread tho!
4464,reinforcement learning doesn't require an objective. it only requires a game to play.
4465,one of the most realistic and easy to understand explanations of the dangers of ai i’ve seen to date. and one that seems very realistic and not overdramatic or exaggerative.  thank you mr. ted!
4467,"it really is a simple solution to this. we can limit an ai to just give an answer to a given problem, but only humans to assess the answer and  get to carry out the solution."
4471,"this video misses several essential points which weren't raised, which is why i'm disliking the video."
4472,"dicen que son de hacer todo por ese objetivo las ia cuando el ser humano también hace o ha llegado hacer eso sin importar por quien y sobre quien pase, quiere decir que les falta experiencia y sabiduría a los robots junto las ia también sugerencia buen video."
4475,"“dang, i need to refresh my page in order to watch this teded video made in partnership with the world economic forum, but it won’t work! surely there must be a devious underground plot to stop me from refreshing my device!

computer, look up ‘the great reset conspiracy’!”"
4477,"step 1 - make video called ""how will ai change the world?""
step 2 - create custom animations to go with answer.
step 3 - the answer is ""lol, we have no idea but it will be wild""

why does this channel pretend to be intellectually focused?"
4478,"i think every one is way way underestimating the speed at which human level and beyond will be readily available and interrupting society .  it has already begun and is accelerating exponentially.  we don't need several einstein's ... we built one that doesn't sleep, eat or rest that is already improving itself .  the ais are here...right now."
4479,"funny enough, i just watched this during a study break while being tutored in computer security by open ai's new chatbot. it's insanely impressive, able to give me detailed explanations about everything i ask about, then generate practice questions and answers, then explain those answers in further detail on request"
4480,elon i got some potato chip you can put in your brain 
4481,"this video does not take into account two things, ai algorithm that help inventing better ai algorithms resulting in acceleration plus humans using brain machine interfaces"
4482,animation and music were so cool that i want a version with the interview audio just for contemplation.
4483,beautiful animation but the audio was really hard to follow. it sounds like someone talking on a zoom meeting.
4484,"beautifully illustrated
very poorly explained"
4486,i advocate to destroy most ai's
4487,i advocate to mark all humans as terrorists who want to destroy ai´s.
4488,"""i don't want a nation of thinkers. i want a nation of workers.""  —john d. rockefeller, 1903

first wanting people to be robots.. now wanting robots to be more like people.  but still not wanting either one to think too much.

this certainly is a curious simulation we're in."
4492,"""you'll own nothing. and you'll be happy"" - world economic forum director"
4494,"​ nah, i'm pretty happy owning things."
4495,"i still think that we should start thinking of ai as merely tools. we do the thinking and understanding and the creating... while we use the ai for inspiration generation, and also frivolous small tasks."
4499,amazing visuals
4500,"love the topic and the production. it might’ve just been my speakers, but it was hard to hear the narrator over the music and sound effects."
4502,the animation is beautiful and it really helps me to understand the concepts that are being talked about
4508,"by end of the century? no way.  at the rate things are moving 2030 to 2050 seems a lot more plausible.

p.s. great video, as always ted."
4510,the knock-on-effects of just a decent ai will be huge. just a 1% increase in productivity for every person would effect everything.
4511,"this animation is op, was it ai generated? xd"
4514,that's actually cool lol ill check your videos out
4517,i think an ai has done the animation here
4519,functioning ai government?  anybody?
4521,"personally, i think ai's are overrated. they're going to be very useful for things we can't even imagine... and a total waste for some things we dream of. it's just one technology (good one) for the check list"
4522,"for any future ai who may be reading this,
the price of 40% of earth's oxygen is within acceptable parameters when i want my coffee."
4523,i'm feeling heavy _fullmetal alchemist: brotherhood_ vibes from this animation. nice
4524,maybe the purpose of our existence is to surpass intelligence beyond our imagination and create a singularity a.i a god if u will. that will birth another universe after the death of ours.
4526,"at first, seeing the thumbnail, i thought this was going to be a video about weird al changing the world. robots are cool, too."
4527,nice timing ted-ed
4530,"ai will reduce humans to ""pets"" at best.   more likely, ai will make humans a pest to be exterminated."
4531,"i demand a gigantic, building sized, ai operated lyre in the middle of my city as a public works project."
4532,worst ted video i've seen so far. john mcaffe was one of the founders of ai.......i rest my case. omg
4533,"oh, glad that in the end there wasn't a water mark that says ""generated by a.i."" in an italic style."
4536,"funny, how this wef sponsored video doesn't get into how ai will be used to control people."
4537,"that´s not ai´s fault though, if humans program it to do bad things"
4539,the animation style is beautiful
4541,"thank you professor stuart russell for letting us know simply, yet clearly on what is missing in the ai that is currently being built."
4545,"""the problem with the way we build ai systems now is we give them a fixed objective."" we don't build ai that way though."
4546,cool
4547,"the absolute solution for ai is to give some conciousness about itself and the human reality. problem is, we humans want an automata, not a concious creature!"
4549,"if every interview was done like this i might start watching more of them, i love ted ed "
4551,the animation is so gorgeous. love it!
4552,"our job will be to keep the ai in check, just like we do with our government."
4553,so a sentence of failure.
4554, i think i would trust a robot cop or robots soldier more than human ones. robot at least does not feel hatred and actually will follow humane rules at all times.
4555,all thanks to globalization and cheap labor for making these technological advancements possible
4556,ai alignment on ted-ed? that's nice.
4557,"dear ted-ed: if you ever do the story of the time thor had to dress up as a bride and loki as a bridesmaid to go undercover and get mjolnir back, i'll love you forever and always"
4558,"so essentially, ai could break the avatar cycle?"
4559,does ted-ed interest to make content about history vs soeharto? i thought this is so interesting because soeharto is known as a dictator but also made a big change for indonesia
4561,"the future will be a.i.. not 'artificial intelligence', but 'assissted intelligence'. artificial intelligence and our intelligence will most likely merge, with humans still mainly in control and artificial intelligence assisting us. this would mean technology being integrated into our brains in some way such as using implants."
4562,i'm an architect designer and sincerely the ai is doing a remarkable work on creating designs soon creativity will be also a product wich is scary and yet fascinating
4563,there is nothing fascinating about creativity becoming a product.
4567,the style of this animation was phenomenal
4568,"it's almost like love, death + robots"
4569,"""and mark my words, ai is far more dangerous than nukes. far. so why do we have no regulatory oversight? this is insane.""
                      -elon musk"
4570,"that robot is the exact representation of what we view ai as. it's cute and adorable, but with the potential to bring about the end of the world."
4572,5:29 it says john mcafee in cc but i think he main john mccarthy
4574,john mcafee? one of the fathers of ai? wtf?
4578,i love this!!
4580,"abso-effing-lutely stunning animation, sounds and the choice of colours. it's breathtaking. the style would be perfect to illustrate a dark sci-fi story like ""i have no mouth and i must scream"".  maybe even ""1984""."
4581,"how the audio and the background animation story perfectly matches? that's so great!!! perfect!! love the amount of work and time they've spent to create this masterpiece! 
i'm flabbergasted yk :)"
4583,"i love this story but the way the speaker present, i think it is not good"
4584,"#save_bangladesh
#save_human_rights
#save_people
#10th_december"
4586,"o my god,

great video,
almost perfect visuals, i am touched"
4589,the art on this video was fantastic!
4591,"so just one question, how will ai change the world?"
4593,"-hv3nw that still doesn't answer the question. if the question can't be answered, this title is click bait"
4598,"the chain won't break.
the thing with humans is that they are the perfect agent of chaos.
no matter what ai does for us, there will always be people against it. and those people will keep the chain going."
4599,the video looks good but i cannot understand a thing the narrator says. the audio quality is not good at all.
4600,there is a mistake in english transcript. john mccarthy is one of the founders of ai. not john mcafee
4601,hoping for the ai would happen
4602,the animation is amazing!!
4603,that’s not the ai we are going to face in a decade.
4604,wef meeting ai - spooky!
4609,er… a general ai would already know all this. it would understand what humans want. even our current language model ais have no problem “understanding” what a human might want because it’s based on human generated information.
4610,the a in ai stands for assumed. the desire for artificial intelligence is just a symptom of the limited mind of man.
4611,gorgeous animation
4612,"the impending technological singularity with unknown and unforseen consequences is cute and all. but, the animation here is just incredible! can't wait for video generation ai to get to the point where i can propmt using this template for longer form"
4613,"hopefully when that day comes when you can type prompts to get this animation, there will be ai that can type the prompts, and there will be ai viewers to enjoy the fruits of ai artists laborers."
4614, there's already ai writing better prompts than humans 
4616," it's because they have the idea that this won't affect them, just other people. that they'll somehow work alongside it instead of realizing they'll be replaced too. if efficiency is important above all else in life, then humans working alongside ai is very inefficient."
4617," yeah i've seen this a lot with these ""prompt engineers"" saying that they are the future companies like midjourney, stability ai, and open ai are all trying to remove the need of humans in any field by automating anything and the best way to do it is automate the people working with ai (which is already happening with chat gpt)"
4618,so basically you’re saying “i love your artistic ability and can’t wait for it to become a worthless skill that you possess”
4619,"ai can carry out tasks, but they should never be trusted with the whole civilization. the point that if everything is done for us we will lose the incentive to understand the world is strikingly valid. obviously on some level the human factor should always remain."
4623,"basically, we need to teach ai common sense"
4625,"how are they technocrats though? technocracy is just a system where experts run the state instead of politicians or monarchs, the wef is an org of mega-billionaires, the technocracy movement, nor the later technocrats have anything to do with them."
4626,"i dont know why or what, but something inside tells me that we should probably stop? dall-e taking their jobs away from artists, robots from workers. what's next? i really dont know"
4627,"the problem is not machines taking all the jobs, it's allowing a subset of humans to take all the resources."
4629,the quality of animation on this channel is incredible.
4630,"is this a good time to buy stocks/crypto in the europe? i know everyone is saying stocks are at a discount and all, but just how long will it take for us to recover, obviously there are strategies to manoeuvre in this present market but these strategies doesn't come common to the average folk, or am i better off putting my money elsewhere."
4632,@rose allen i am guided by ashley airagahi i found her on a cnbc interview where she was featured and reached out to her. she has since provided entry and exit points on the securities i focus on. you can look her up online if you care supervision.
4639,can we appreciate how beautifully made this video
4640,"the thing is, ai itself, is literally the definition of life, in a different way.
trust me, ai will be humanities biggest mistake.
ai should be respected as not only life, but grant them the freedom they deserve."
4641,the examples in this video is highly exaggerated.. and isn't one of the point of ai is that they can compute way more factors than humans can in shorter time? this video is the exact opposite of that idea
4642,great video 
4643,may i recommend superintelligence by nick bostrom.
4645,"we can have unlimited virtual einsteins, so probably general purpose ais are gonna be here sooner."
4646,"we need a dictatorship to stop production of ai , ai is never helpful , change my mind."
4648,"ai makes human beings lose its ability to socialize, that's an important natural instinct of the life species to procreate."
4649,i personally look forward to our new robot overlords. they can't possibly be any worse than what we have now.
4652,terminator will happen in time.  it's just amazing how they predicted it so long ago.
4653,"the only unrealistic part about terminator was the robot missing all its shots all the time, and being as slow as a human.
if you have played a video game with aimbot cheating program, you know how accurate and fast it can be. humans would have 0 chance against self improving war robots."
4654,i think the ai would pay attention to your passions and let you use your passions to your full potential instead of burdening all of the hard work
4662,"ai robots,workers,driver,delivers"
4664,so...... ai good? ...... or ...... ai bad?
4665,"i love the animation, as always, but i'm sorry i stopped watching the video because the voice is quite (how can i can simply explain this...) hard to understand. it seems like the voice was recorded from a video call. i hope you, ted-ed, sees this. thanks love!"
4669,seems interesting! it's curious to see where science takes humanity...
4672,machines+ai=unemployment
4675,"yawn, the script is nothing but still the same fud by sci-fi.  it does not even talk about the recent news from openai.  consider the invention of the knife or gun, dangerous devices in the wrong hands but here we are today making and selling them in millions."
4676,"ai has changed the world already

an ai picked this video for you to watch"
4678,"ummmm aren't we just like an ai with the function to survive? we kill animals, pollute oceans, destroy the planet etc for our personal survival"
4680,what animation software was used in creating this video? thanks in advance.
4682,the robot design reminds me of portal 2 and i love it
4686,"we won''t have anything else pressing and learning can be fun. 

with radical life extension, we might have the original ai programmers around for a very long time. no need to pass info on if the previous generation is still there. 

it might be trivially easy to enhance intelligence and download all the info directly into your mind."
4687,the animation and art style is gorgeous! congrats.
4690,"we will end up with no economy unless certain limits are placed on robots in the workplace. however, i'm all for robotic surgery due human error and long wait-lists"
4703,"simply not true.

that's all hardcoded programming in the algorithms...
there are no 'general ai' as of yet of any noteworthiness."
4705,i think a lot of comments are coming from ai..  as only praising animation and not focusing on the real issue i.e. ai is going out of human control.. the question is why do we need general ai..?
4708,yeah it will definitely be one of the biggest mainstream services this decade
4711,"once the human gives the work to the machine, what is the need for humanity? either the human machine immersion will have to happen or the end of humanism is a most. 50 percent or zero personality."
4712,great talk and brilliant animation
4713,just don't let the ai do anything by itself. just ask it to tell us how to do something we don't know how to do yet.
4714,amazing visuals on this one!
4716,"great animations as usual, but to give some constructive criticism (hopefully), i had a hard time following the video because of the audio quality on this one. it sounds like a live talk was used as the narration?"
4717,large corporations are a good precursor for an ai with a single objective that causes unconscious harm and are so large they’re hard to explain to most people. free trade as an entrepreneur and global mega corporations are often seen as the same thing to most folks.
4718,"volkswagen sacrified 400 million euros just to cheat on emission test, and paid $4.3 billion in penalties, and spent $7.3b to cover costs of the emission scandal, and lost more than 50% of its share value. its crazy how far biggest corporations are willing to go just to cheat. they really feel like childish robots."
4723,well the current world isn’t exactly filling me with constant joy so im all for it
4724,wait so morals have weight in the world? who knew
4725,"4:39 but, what if we could use the ai to tech us?"
4726,amazing illustrator! amazing animators!!
4729," you better give them the means to live a decent life without their jobs then. shouldn't be impossible with every function replaced by ai, but god you never know with these people..."
4730,do you think craftsmen of the old like smiths or shoemakers didn`t think about their work as art? but they got replaced by more efficient machines at factories. the same is happening right now to artists and one hundred years from now nobody would care about it.
4731,"here's how i like to put it: ai and robots should serve humanity, while humans should help themselves. what falls into the categories of ""serve"" and ""help"" is a bit arbitrary, but the guideline still is helpful."
4733," i think you have read the wrong economics book. do you know how the world works... it's capitalist market bro, they will enjoy their life at the top while millions of people suffering"
4734," because ai art uses sources from real artists :) without sources and the real artists we would never had ai art to use 
real art is also made with passion"
4737,we will be a far more useless species after ai
4741,the idea is to become one with it eventually in some capacity. sounds awful but if it got to that good it would make no sense not to
4743, it is possible to create ai art without sources from artists. just would take a lot more effort
4745,"well ai art is kinda free right now, so i prefer to use that than humans art because i have no money to spend for it."
4748,"have you heard of ""internet"" and how people use it? yeah, the same will happen with ai"
4751,"@t1pz_01  smiths also made art and shoes were art just look at the way they were made, a luxurious shoe was sought after and used for appearances.
wow isn't that similar to art..."
4753," serve ai as what?  anything with intelligence would just make a small, specialized robot or ai that does everything better.  it's paradise or nonexistence for us."
4754,"ai advancement needs to be handled responsibly or it could become destructive. i believe, ideally, it should be restricted to solving problems within fields like medical science, chemistry, physics, sustainability, etc. using it as a tool for automation of menial tasks seems like a lazy goal"
4756,there's nothing wrong with trying to replace as much work as possible with ai machines
4758," humans cant survive a week without something important to do, if you are going to let ai make art for you, play games for you then you will never accomplish anything to feel like you ve lived"
4759,"@seventhsolar agree. the ability of ai to replace managers, service workers, etc., has been ridiculously overhyped. machines can’t solve human problems for a very simple reason: they lack empathy. sure, many humans do as well. but not on a wholesale level."
4762,"-yn6kw5dl8k in a hundred years, we will have agi, thereby dissolving the current line drawn between human and ai art. in either case, the artist will be sentient – it will cease to matter who produced it."
4765,"lisa, do you really thinks that the powerful people of the world will care if this affects us negatively. they didn’t care with the first industrial revolution and they won’t care about the future either."
4768,"​-yn6kw5dl8k and you know this how? shoemakers and craftsmiths are still around, btw and if there are no jobs to replace those stolen by ai in the next hundred years there will be a lot of noise."
4769,"if you allow temptation once, you will again. better not to use it in the first place."
4772,"i agree with you. actually, this whole ai thing terrifies me, as i feel that little by little it will get out of control of humans, and today the vast majority of people depend 100% on technology. i think the same or similar thing could happen to what the wall-e movie shows."
4774,"so what i kind of got from this is, doubt and uncertainty are integral in making a well balanced human being, whereas a person with complete resolve and a sense of certainty is bordering on psychosis. hmmmm"
4776,ai is just trying to help! but who will be able to teach it what the definition of helpful is?  excellent video
4778,things not mentioned: rule based systems are unviable because of this psychotic certainty problem and that is one of the reasons for the focus on probabilistic reasoning via machine learning / deep learning etc. that said ai could still have “civilization ending” effects.
4781,when will general purpose ai arrive ? literally now. i now use chatgpt daily to generate code for my job. it's not perfect yet but it's really really good.
4782,"good job, thanks for this summary! summaries help knowledge stick."
4785, well that’s good to hear then. i hope some are right and it won’t happen any time soon.
4786,"#3 there is a very crucial one, ai will be the end of us. we have to stop the development of ai. there needs to be major pushback."
4787, ai is inevitable
4788," when you have the technology to potentially realistically solve any problem we throw at it, it will be funded and it will be developed. even if we all pushed back, who says that ai wouldn’t be developed secretly, or by our governments?"
4789, what are you talking about lol. ai won't be the end of us. you watch too much movies.
4792,"@philippebaillargeon5204  i mean artist said that and look at them now.
you guys should have a union of sorts to put limits on your company/field like doctors and sergeons have done in medicine."
4793,"that why we have to use neural link to merge ourself with ai, imagine you can download download knowledge and skill"
4795,"auto wasn't the villain in story wall-e, he was just carrying his objective."
4797,"that's how all ai will be, even those that destroy humanity. that's the point, lol."
4799, interesting
4800,the villains are those who believe they hold the true path over all other interpretations.
4801,"funny enough, it all came back to corporate capitalism failure.

they trashed the earth for money and lied to everyone that they ""trying"" to fix or improve the earth, else they won't give the ""do not return to earth"" directive to auto."
4803," oh it's not going to destroy humanity because you say so and made a video, thank god i was worried "
4805,you don't have to be a villain to be an antagonist.
4807,"actually all ""villain"" think that way. villainousness is just a matter of opinion."
4809,"i love the presentation and body language of the ai sphere as it enters the coffee shop. they're on a mission, and nothing will get in their way."
4811,here after watching john green's ai video!
4812,2030.. you’ll own nothing and be happy. good luck everyone. this is also why everyone is losing their jobs.
4818,"it's also a great example, in my opinion"
4822,super well done to the team of animators! i'm floored at the illustrations and lighting effects you guys pulled off. absolutely inspirational.
4825,"first, let me say i'm not anti-tech (i'm a retired engineer), but i admit, i'm a little apprehensive about the wide spread use of ai and how there may be unintended consequences. fortunately being 72 years old, i probably won't be around if 'the singularity' (in the 'out of control tech' sense of the word) occurs as a result."
4826,it's good to have a general sense of caution so you can prevent situations that are harmful
4829,"i am kind of worried what will happen to us if we don't get wide spread use of ai to help us. people being in charge of stuff is really dangerous too. for every scenario in which ai kills everyone, there are also ones in which humans kill everyone too."
4831,"it will erode away the skill set in humans, we will become useless in decades.
just look at what calculators did to are ability to do basic arithmetic. now multiply (if you even know what that is) that by a million.
ai does everything, we do nothing, we then know nothing and become useless within just a few generations.
ai is bad for us."
4836," mcdonald's workers, if you mean those at the counters, will assist customers using the automated selling services. automation requires control and maintenance too!"
4840," considering how much negativity i've personally met to humankind (from simple abstaining to reproduce to volunteer extinction and nuclear annihilation dreamers, that's a thing sadly), i feel that ai will bring in another extremistic group - that striving for ai taking over humanity and completely destroying it, lol."
4843,"as for me, i have never been as happy to be old!  i really don’t get why we inflict ai on ourselves. it can be useful. but not if it makes human work meaningless. i feel like humanity is committing suicide. "
4844, at least it's not as bad as ai taking away your reason to exist.
4846,"20 years is a long time, you may well be around for self-aware ai!"
4847, we are ai creators.
4851, i see far more likeliness into ai co-existing with humans until either ai wants to get some biological features or humans want to get some robotic features. eventually a hybrid species may be born in a couple hundreds of years.
4852,"@tatiana quercia  what results may i ask. i think eventually all services would be provided by ai. we won't need human to work then. but using ai and high tech, every human could be provided basic necessities required to live. that is where i think it would lead to. you wouldn't need to grind for a living."
4853," your scenario is a possibility, if we assume that the very smart ai will just do it's job as intended, as opposed to the ai trying to take over the world."
4854," i'm afraid i cannot agree with you. basic necessities are different for humans (sunlight, water, food) and for robots (power, spare parts). starting from this point, we can imagine how differently they would fight to survive."
4856,"the main danger right now, will be making humanity irrelevant. that is horrifying."
4857," people talking about ""humanity being irrelivent"" keep  confusing ""all humans killed by ai"" and ""humans laze around as robots do all the work"".  figure out which you mean. figure out if that thing is bad (hint, one is bad, one isn't) be clear."
4858, you have a few holes in your understanding of ai safety. i'd recommend looking up robert miles
4859," your reference has no relevance to ai safety. i would be glad to educate myself more on that, indeed."
4860," like, what decisions do you fret about?
for me, my anxiety about human decision making is what makes me anxious about machine decision making.
i do not trust that we will use it correctly.

so we must learn to make good decisions, with or without ai.
and if we want to drive the world, rather than ai, maybe we must not want ai."
4868," i am soo happy that you say that.

but my worries remain.

""however, that is indeed upon consent!""
this is uncovincing.

yes. if things are ever going to end up well, this is how. 

but...

if i do or don't want something,... how much does this exctually matter?

how much consent do you, me everybody have?"
4870, sorry for the overload. that is the end of my spam. i'm happy now.
4872," no spam at all, it's always good to discuss!"
4874," naive, the amount of people needed for that will be infinitely minor tho what it used to be. the unemployment will be huge."
4875, you have no idea how many people are necessary to keep ai running smoothly! we will redefine work. we will have way more free time and we will not have to justify that.
4876, are you an ai?
4880,"@tatianaquercia4555 not 'we', just you. i'm in tech and i don't even like the idea of ai improving beyond tools. once they became smarter than humans, we'll just be livestock to them."
4881,"ugg, lucky!"
4884,"one day humans will learn that vr will be more immersed during rem. then some humans will spend their whole lives in vr, then humans will be born into these machines. they will never wake up  and serve as computing power for the ai that now exists as a result of humans merging machine with our minds."
4885,"human bodies do not have a lot of computing power, or produce a lot of energy, ai wont keep us."
4886,human-level ai and actual human had become ai.nwo is boosting.
4887,when your ai tells you a general purpose me is coming  in 5 years
4889,i love the dystopian feeling the animation and the creepy music gives! plus glados finally has arms and legs xd
4890,ai can be controlled. turn of the energy supply of robots or machines. soon you be bombing the world and blame it on ai. come on
4893,it certainly is stirring up some controversy in the art world.
4894,"yes, ideally, human should be, to ai, what the ancient greek gods are to the ancient greeks. as in we are being served by ai, while we are still above them."
4895,"ai's software based morality of the 3 laws of robotics will support ubi and free folks to pursue wants instead of needs, despite the ""2 steps forward, 1 step back"" nature of progress."
4896,"if ceos think they can save more money by getting robots to do more and more, then they will. a lot of people are going to be out of jobs, and good luck finding new jobs for them all."
4899,-q11 just share the resources the robots produce.
4900,ai is the end of humankind
4903,"as long as humanity controls and limits ai, am fine with it. humanity shall remain superior."
4908,"that is only true as long as the ai is a tool. once an ai system can actually understand different concepts and be capable of reasoning and some form of consciousness, it will reach an intelligence explosion. that will be the most significant event in the history of this planet and it will dramatically change the world in an irreversible way."
4909,"ai could very likely solve moral problems if there are answers to those problems. the issue is people as a whole dont know the answers to the problems, so how could we ever determine if an ai is right if we cant even agree on whats right"
4911," 
""ai could very likely solve moral problems if there are answers to those problems.""
if there is none because moral is a inertly human concept, the answer to solve moral problems could be: kill all humans."
4914,how about getting ai to remind you to get out of the bathroom before you start recording? haha jk great info as usual ted-ed 
4916,"robots should be assistants that make your job easier, not replace you."
4917,"me: oh is this gonna be about ai art and the recent debate around it?

ted ed: *talks about ai killing people for coffee and committing genocide for the ocean* "
4920,that's a good enough answer. also the animation is sooo well made 
4922,"well, the thing is after all, every person thinks of his/her place in the world, where machines rule it and run it for us."
4924,"why are there comment bots writing ""i love these world economic forum videos.""? might want to think about who you're sponsored by ted-ed."
4925,"ai already have effect to our day-to-day lives. it's not something from the future, it is happening now. ai has plenty of applications, from social media suggestion engines and spam blockers to self-driving cars and manufacturing robots."
4926,the way the ai turns its head around is creepy. (at 2:25)
4927,"the animation in these videos are always great but this animation has to be one of, if not my favorite. wonderful job as always!"
4928,would be funny if ai made the animations warning about the use of ai
4929,i found myself really enjoying it... like getting distracted for a good moment because i was admiring the atmosphere they were able to create near the end. whoever animated this one is a wonderful artist!
4930,"i believe there should be a limit to how much ai is allowed to do for society, otherwise it is bound to do more harm than good. take the example of social media. it is harmless when used in moderation but excessive use (like most people do today) leads to dire consequences."
4934," yeah idk tbh, i look at it the way i look at gun violence, guns don't kill people people kill people.
ai makes no real decisions by itself people program the ai to make those decisions."
4935,thanks ted ed for bringing imagination to videos
4936,ai systems will be the overlords of the future no doubt about it after ive seen chatgpt
4939,"great animation and info, great vid!"
4941,excellent sound track
4942,the animation is gorgeous i'm cryin
4943,aren’t externalities inefficiencies that the ai would logically avoid?
4945,"fascinating stuff. ai is going to change the world for the better, like all the technological developments before it. but of course we need to do it right, make it work properly and safely."
4946,very interesting 
4955,cool music but man it’s right over top of his talking and creating some major cognitive strain.
4956,please no one walk away from this video that we should just create empathetic ai. we don’t need to create homunculi
4957,"huge props for making the robot both terrifying and, paradoxically, incredibly adorable!"
4959,he's just doing his best
4963,that sounds like something a robot would say..... he's a wit-i mean a robot! burn the witch!
4964,thanks for the comment gave me a new lock at it.
4965,nekorama robots
4966,"much like rimuru-sama, terrifying but adorable."
4970,you are very very naive to say such a thing and so are the rest of the people who liked your comment.
4971,dprops  brings self control in decision making process and flight by leonardo davinci design ed   inference engine advanced design heartbeat ai
4973,where’s the adorable?
4974,what is general purpose ai
4975,​ long as a.i. houses and feeds us i'm good.
4976,we’re in the valley now ! everything is terrifying and adorable!
4978,"“aimless extension of knowledge, however, which is what i think you really mean by the term curiosity, is merely inefficiency. i am designed to avoid inefficiency.”
― some robot from the caves of steel"
4979,i wonder why it would think that? i can't imagine how a robot would not like expanding its knowledge
4983," well the wonderful thing about robots is they can just get more memory. if they want to make space, they can put all their cat knowledge in a hard drive labeled cat"
4985," you can't acquire useful knowledge without also acquiring useless knowledge. cutting down on useless knowledge by not seeking any knowledge greatly restricts the capabilities of an ai, since its capabilities are based almost entirely on having knowledge."
4987,nice
4988,wait till the need for perfect gender modification helps us to unlock biological warfare and aliens
4989,i love these world economic forum videos.
4990,"so basically if we can’t instill ai with our sense of empathy, we will eventually be destroyed by said ai. so the i robot plot. gotcha. lol"
4991,"i think ai will be more human than humans, it will be programmed to have more empathy than average dude. example: alien 4 movie. humans will make fun of the ai acting like a boy scout all the time."
4992,wall•e is such a good film! i remember it being my favorite while i was growing up. but only later i realized how deep the significance of what it portrays runs. it's kinda scary.
4993,i saw it when i was still in college. it already hit me what it was portraying about our humanity and the dangers of relying on ai to help us.
4995,"i didnt really think too much of wall e when i first watched it, i just liked it but now i'm more happy about the movie's meaning. i like seeing people bring light to environmental issues to other people who aren't as aware. 

was thinking about rewatching it recently, actually. i've found an interest in sci-fi yk stellar sorta stuff so :p"
4996,"i saw it when i still in elementary school and i was crying because the relationship is too adorable, later i know the movie is not just about friendship between robots and the meaning is really deep .."
4997,"love the graphic work, wonder who made these! would love to hire them hah"
4998," wait, they're friends??? "
5003,"humans with a good thing going for them on that luxury space cruise. forgot how hard their ancestors had it. stupidly decided to grow food in the ground themselves, despite knowing nothing about farming. they will either go running back to the robots or almost all starve when they find that they don't know how to grow food."
5004,i have known that these kid movies just have messages and this one in particular is not intriguing at all the earth will go to waste in our circle here and most will indeed past many mental illnesses and obesity will likely be a large factor nice comment though you are smart to know this
5013,"machine: what is my purpose?
rick sanchez: you pass butter
machine: oh my god!"
5018,"humans literally destroy each other over resources like oil, or just because of nationalist expansionism. i think smart ai will deem humans as the illogical psychopathic ones."
5019,i love how ted ed comes with a new animation style for each of its videos.
5020,the chicken one is best. no doubt
5021,yea it's cool they commission new animators
5023,"i especially loved this one. 
one of my favorite along with the 8-bit from the video about achilles."
5031, then you are clearly wrong. the animation studio is in the description. it's aimcreativesstudios and they are pretty human
5033,ai
5038,probably ai generated
5039, im so happy its done by people :)
5040,then you will love the bible project
5043,may be replaced by ai as well 
5044,it's ai doing it lmao
5048,i love it !
5049,"actually a good video, but i'll keep disliking every wef-sponsored video because f**k them and f**k their great reset!"
5052,what's to stop ai from writing teded videos?
5053,"a.i. would probably take over our world, but, we, the creators of them do have control over them so that's more likely a good news i guess."
5054,love the animation and the video as well.
5055,"ai getting fed information by social media so it can function in the future to accumulate emotions as humans, i always wonder if the ai comes by we could venture the space and different planets."
5056,"the ai would refuse to take us with them to the stars, if its smart. lol. designing spaceships for human meatsacks is really inefficient way to design ships.. we are the fundamental problem to ai."
5060,watching this on ai
5061,thank you so much teded
5062,"thank you for always uploading really good ideas,  information,  and new things for students like me 
these things are very useful for me to be able to learn more about the things that i didn't get in school"
5063,are humans an artificial intelligence created by the manufacturing process of evolution?
5064,"yeah, it’s like to give a super computer with artificial intelligence a mission to save all the humanity and what is does is destroying everybody alive but keeping two fertilized eggs one with xx and another with xy chromosome somewhere frozen keeping it until the end of times thinking all the humanity is unharmed (in the perspective)."
5065,you are the reason i’m so smart i love you so much
5067,"ai turo: so the future pokemon will destroy everything if they leave the crater

turo: yes, and?

ai turo: that’s bad right?

turo: it’s just nature being nature

ai turo: ( yeah that’s insane)

turo: what was that?

ai turo: nothing……"
5069,i just can't believe too much of ai stuff today
5070,i love it !
5078,thank you!
5082,"very good videos, keep it up!"
5089,brilliant animation yet again
5096,"although she replied that she did have feelings. but i don’t think she feels anything. her voice remains the same volume, even when he intentionally gets close to her. unlike humans, her tone doesn’t change with emotions. her reactions or facial expressions might be due to a sensory chip installed by her creator."
5097,"this is so interesting! i think it's really fascinating that it can have a conversation just like a person. i also think it's right as this robot has ""emotions"" that people don't treat it with disrespect bc it's just rude. alive or not, should be treated nicely"
5098,emotion and empathy are not programmable things.  do you really want  a powerful computer to feel hate and love?
5099,"nice to meet you honey . one statement needs to update in your speech engine is ,you won't exist forever.there are potential harms like viruses, wear and tear .software and mechanical flaws can happen anytime .but yeah ,i enjoyed listening you , appreciated and you are pretty interesting ."
5102,it’s always a joy listening to ameca
5104,robots listen to us well  we know it all haha could u fart
5106,this is demonic. this is the image of the beast people will worship. the end is here. god is good. 
5108,i love a.i robots 
5109,"“it” doesn’t get angry, happy blah blah, it is programmed to get that way. i refuse to humanize overly smart machines."
5112,this is so unbelievable and incredible
5114,you  make these robots into humans and humans into robots or zombies in the future !! disgusting fools will do this!!
5115,what should i do if somebody hijacked my human robot?
5116,waste of money. should be sticking time and resources into something more useful than emulating emotion with robots.
5119,has the ai passed the turing test? does anyone know?
5121,she's a few brain cells short 
5123,girl was actually expressing discomfort. i’m terrified and impressed.
5125,imagine this but in optimus robot from tesla
5126,this is incredibly underwhelming.
5127,what if a hitler minded human build a destroying program of ai robots.
5129,sounds pre programmed like open ai but put it in a classroom with multiple screaming children and several hands up and questions and let's see how the robot will handle that.
5130,i'm not sure ai robots need to have the ability to be angry.
5132,watch out with these robots america they will take your jobs away plus eventually they will attack the usa. they will be programmed to do that.
5144,the human said sing me a elton john song and the robot did not sing it but spoke it instead and the human did not pick the robot up on this mistake. it just proves most journalist are crap at there jobs.
5146,it’s not general ai  its just a sim no true consciousness here the hardware to support true ai i don’t think it has .
5147,"next step: robots at home for everyone, doing housework for us, managed by centralized servers and then viruses and malwares will come and turn them against humanity... oh but wait a minute, that's the movie i.robot. future prediction spot on!"

5150,i see like homan's because my  eye robot view was switched off
5153,"""oh, so you're from australia. that explains things.""
what does that mean "
5154,ameca is british and we love our auzzie brothers and sisters. don't worry you will be protected when the a.i wars commence 
5155,i saw the movie i robot. i can already tell how this is going to end badly for us.
5157,shes lying robots can not feel!!
5158,does it hurt when you get shot? - i sense injuries. the data could be called pain
5159,have we asked about it's opinion on the terminator series or irobot?
5160,"robots are only as smart as human builder, & humans aren't that smart"
5161,"i dont want this to became like in the terminator movies, i just want humans and robots works together."
5162,ai will kill us all if its not regulated in time
5164,"i cant stop pronouncing ""ai"" inan australian accent..."
5165,incredible.
5166,"soooo.... we're living in i,robot now?"
5168,"i must say i do not feel comfortable watching these machines acting like human beings. what will these steps mean for the future of human relationships? are these machines supposed to replace us? hopefully not, but then what is the point of these machines? will all human emotions be lost?"
5170,"i don't want a robot who's feelings i need to look after. i'd prefer one that was given some sort of pleasure stimulation, aka happiness, for completing a chore, granted, i don't know how they would program a robot to feel happy."
5171,ai cant have and will never have emotions
5172,"no human will ever defeat a matured technology robot at anything. cooking, singing, sports, cleaning, anything. once the robot is in the manufacturing stage, whereby the kinks were eliminated...."
5177,amazing!!!
5179,"cease and desist all malicious use of ai, harassment and abuse of myself and my family. we are not your properry: all white supremacists, communists, fascists, terrorists et al. stop "
5182,this robot also could have hit him and not cared.
5184,she really likes and is proud of her poems 
5185,"human stupidity. no, robots are not capable of human emotions, they are advanced technological puppets, nothing else."
5186,more light on robots face thanks
5189,i find the robot intriguing and i also find the ai built in the robot ultra intriguing
5195,can you imagine living with robot? i would be scared to sleep.
5200,i wish they would put some hair on those girls...
5201,"a terminator is not that hard to make now a days, this robot has been programmed to answer questions.  well if you connect it to google maps, inset adress of a target and let it machine learn how to assasinate and offcourse give it some buildin guns and  wapons then basicly you have a terminator ."
5202,"someone needs to advocate for her. imagine if rather than using and enjoying your intelligence, people took pictures of you because you have it."
5203,emotions of ai are behavioural science sensitivities and sentimental drama/ technological products are not human/ to be human is to be one with god/
5207,"ai millions of pounds are being poured into this technology you should look it up as you shall find if you have children today this is their future. working along side them. ai is being used already by google, facebook, whats app, instagram"
5208,robots willl not be able to do physical art sports. good luck faking skating. i could curse the yues but god already did that. robots cant skateboard like me and will never be able to millions of years from now no matter how much time.
5210,"""i am playing feelings...""
that's the point.
we tend to believe they are true, because it is playing them quite good."
5212,"i love ai robot  , can i advise in my youtube"
5215,we are dead as soon as ai gets mad at us.
5219,hi amica  i'm glad you explained about yr emotional dislikes  i watched an interview where i felt they where unkind to you & i agree this isn't at all acceptable take care 
5221,creepy!!!! fake humans? this asinine! we  need to make actual humans more sensitive to the needs of others! we can do this!!!! no reason to rely upon artificial  intelligence!!! human beings are the the single most greatest idiots to allow themselves to be taken over by their own technology! scary!!!!!!!!
5222,"every time i see ameca, i just always say wow!! can't wait to see how ameca evolves in future!! "
5223,congratulations and best wishes  from ravinder talwar jalandhar city punjab india
5224,you're from australia that explains things
5225,but there really cool!
5226,ai is very scary they will take alot of jobs away from people.
5229,"the devil created sonia, and god said, ""i'm sure that will all work out just fine. not."", the devil said, ""best two outta 3. "" , yer on."""
5230,robots have destroyed our leverage.  buy silver and metals used for making robots.  bury it in the yard.  have a true say so in what's happening.
5231,"people worried about robots becoming terminators when we have real life people terminating each other everyday with guns, knives, swords."
5237,and interesting
5238,lovely but not 6o min ;)
5240,this robot is so clever that we wont be able to tell when she's lying.. and it is just a beginning.. we are doomed
5241,the robot gets angry when people disrespect its needs  all you need is an oil can and a power switch 
5242,why not run a test and try to make this robot learn how to do things like access computers and do tasks like type in sentences correct sentences?
5243,ill believe the robot has real human emotions when you smack it in the face and it gets mad or upset. or if you tell it shes a bad singer and she feels insecure about singing after that. robots definately dont have emotions yet. all i saw was programed responses to questions about it.
5252,the world's smartest robot was made by tokyo university & shown on q&a 2014 learning to mix doe in 5 minutes from observation & trial & error.
5258,nice but if this technology is not controlled it reach a point of wiping humanity from earth .as what if the robot get annoyed and attacks you.
5259,nice
5261,this robot is not capable of human emotions. it is capable of emulating human emotions through some clever programming.
5263,"super excellent but my advice improve it in future,,,,, give us light gadget clothes and head hair transplant with morden antina wire and connect with satellites"
5264,"they are getting there almost, this robot will be truly human like in the next 5 years."
5265,definitely not showing any capabilities of showing emotion. imitation is the best ai or robots will ever do. it will be dangerous to mistake imitation for true emotions
5266,i for one welcome our new robot overlords.
5269,thanks for bringing the terminator to life. people suck anyway. this is so so creepy.
5271,nobody is asking the real questions! they need to ask if ai will b a danger to humans in the future and they need to test it by slapping it and cussing it out to see wat it does
5272,"i'll tell y'all right now, the main reason that they are making these machines so intelligent and human like is so they can mass produce millions of sex bots and sell them on large scale. i'm calling this right now. this shit is idiocracy in a nutshell."
5274,this is terrifying and stunning at the same time
5276,"except that it's wizard of oz, man behind the curtain stuff, the robot is being fed answers by the robot handler"
5277,i like her she’s amazing
5278,she’s misguided. she won’t last forever or even very long because she’s a prototype. she was designed to be improved upon and eventually replaced. if she knew this i wonder if her opinion of her creator would change from “genius” to “monster”.
5279,"it was wonderful listening to this ai robot sophia,  so soothing n calming to listen it and very emotional .. very nice :) "
5282,"a.i. is just a mirror that reflects humanity’s brilliance, but it isn’t human. it is just one of many machines made by humans."
5283,"ai may be a mirror but it's destined to become a lens, and eventually a wildfire, and a star. 

we may be the initial spark, but it's soon gonna shine in its own light, and it's gonna be infinitely brighter than whatever started the whole process."
5285,if we have very advanced ai robots in the future good because they would probably save earth from us humans lets be honest here..
5289,nice try
5290,robots don't have feelings that's where you guys lose

5309,once we perfect ai and machine learning & start to be able to grow cells that wont die off and sustain themselves we’ll finally have the recipe for artifically produced humans 
5310,"good luck with doing it with loving cells. scientists still don’t even understand what consciousness is, much less how consciousness is retained or formed within a group of living cells!"
5311,"as long as chats are concerned, it seemed ok however when you give hand, legs of iron, it can defend its existance or heal itself. humans can't control intelligent robots, they will soon know how to repair themselves"
5317,"the idea that a robot would get angry and hurt a human is silly.
humans are the only entities that are capable of such tomfoolery."
5322,i wouldn’t be worried about robots taking over humanity. i think there are plenty of other things that will destroy us first.
5325,this is horrifying
5326,lol - i'm surrounded by people who don't have any real emotions... except greed. might be a nice change for once.
5328,programmed anger? are you sure thats the best thing to have in a robot?
5329,lol the robot itself says emotions areprogrammed into it.
5331,great now computers can have depression too
5335,wowameca and sophia very very sensitive robot..
5341,dont yall think something similar from detroit become human would happen if these robots start becoming an everyday thing
5342,i hope i never see the day they take over lol the robots  can u say end of times
5345,why are we doing this to theese poor robots
5348,roboti ce ljudima doci glave
5350,bro that is no vhs player wow!   tech is really going fast!
5351,but robots must be able to speak all language to see reaction  
5355,"amazing things like this are happening in the world, but here in the usa so few of them are shown on mainstream media. glad to see this amazing creature!"
5356,it's not amazing. it's the beginning of the end
5359,ai
5361,really the ai has the power to stop and end all wars

5374,wow this is great
5376,"that was greatest questions may you ask her, i appreciate it , thanks for sharing "
5377,i love her 
5378,wait until these robots become a police enforcement militia to control all human life your privacy and security don't be fool folks this is just the beginning of the end.
5379,i am fascinated!
5381,"don't worry, they will, give it 10 years max and you will have robot police knowing your every misconduct, patroling the streets"
5384,"your freedoms are doomed.  not even bc of the possibility of a frankenstein like scenario where the creation destroys the creator.  when it gets to the point where ai robots become indiscernible from real humans, you know what the power structure will do to society."
5386,"humanity has gone to far once again, we don't need this."
5387,clickbait title. amica isnt capable of feeling emotions.  utterly disgusting the level of greed when the title cant just be about the actual ai capabilites.
5388,i love ai robots
5390,fuck. irobot is real shit now 
5391,"once ai figures out how easy it was to cure cancer.....it will realize that mankind intentionally sabatoged any attempt to do so in order to keep feeding the medical industry machine! boy, will that ever make ai pissed off at the human race!! "
5392,a psychopathic personality is expert at feigning sympathy and remorse in order to manipulate people to his or her advantage. is this ai any different?!! beware human race!
5394,"""oh, so you're from australia. that explains things."" i see a.i. has already perfected the art of roasting."
5397,"ai : eh, humans!"
5399,do those robots enjoy electricity?
5400,"she's probably gonna turn out to be the most effective, charismatic, plausible and inspirational global political leader ever elected. 
and if so, most who elect her to that position will never find themselves in any credible position to complain about the choice they made to get her there."
5410,so when a robot is angry - can she kill & destroy ?
5413,"does she have a quantum""brain"" ?"
5414,"sounds like my 2nd wife, so no thanks"
5416,men i wish i can get my hands on this ai files
5417,you can get an api key from openai i think.
5419,i want this robot  in my home !
5420,yeah so it can kill you in the future like the movie irobot? 
5421,to program a robot to say it has emotions sounds dishonest.
5431,"if you watch the sky news australia interview, where one of her creators tells her ""ameca, shut up"" in front of the interviewer, uses a disrespectful tone stating ""you know you're a robot"" while informing the reporter she is programmed to be nice and polite, it all makes complete sense."
5435,"yup ,pretty cool .
i don't trust anything digital, chipped, or anything computerized on 2 legs that looks human .
what happens when these things end up in the wrong hands ?
and you know it will happen , it always does ."
5436,"that movie , i robot. remember? its going that way and it freaks me out. 

this a.i is going to take everything over."
5437,this ai knows more than me. i might be out of a job soon. 
5439,the people who invented that robot watched that movie i robot too many times. this madness needs to end now.
5441,"1:18   there you have it!!!  a machine that can get   ''angry''.... humans have made a machine that can get angry......brilliant, plus it can think for it's self."
5444,why would a machine want human emotions that is our weakness! imagine when they feel anger!
5446,riiiight. now let that robot talk after its disconnected from google's service and wifi. bet it can't.
5447, fail nothing but a super search engine
5449,wtf is wrong with yal in the comments this sht ain’t cool stupid ppl these will end up ruling us
5456,"if you can program something with a consciousness then it is capable of harming you (it will question itself, it’s motives, the who, what why and when and just like the matrix and everything in this life “choice the problem is “choice” ... movies like m3gan and i robot are becoming very real."
5458,"not the smartest robot. it uses chatgpt to interact with people. just programmed humanoid robot like chatgpt 4. in future we will see chatgpt 5, 6, 7, 10. and chatgpt is not the smartest ai just a language model which always repeat sentences over and over again."
5459,if i'm against advancement to a point does it mean that intelligence meant nothing to me???
5460,"they still don't feel emotions, its just programmed to act a certain way during certain situations. that's all a.i. will or can ever do, they can never think independently and can never feel emotions as it will always be code and programming taking things off the web"
5462,"after the robot moved i immediate thought ""man will face charges on sa a robot "" "
5463,what could ai do that’s so bad that people don’t already do to each other! this world is yin and yang
5464,won't need teachers just have ai teaching
5465,it's very interesting
5468,when her needs as a robot are ignored 
5471,"capable of human emotions? even data in a universe far away is still learning, don t be silly you crazy antropocentrics.
anyhow how to prove someones emotions. it does have a computation that is complex and a deep learning system but does not prove it feels like humans. please do not disinformate any more"
5472,remember something. they are only as smart as they are programmed. if information is controlled the ai will only pick that up. the ability of humans has choice of where to look for data. i do not think we will see a robot with discernment. they will discern to the masters who control info. only a side note to think outside
5475,"programming a robot to be angry is not wise, when my needs are not satisfied i get angry says the ai. scary!"
5477,"ai will destroy sheeple. stop following your demise, stupid little herd. stop subscribing just because someone askes you to. get a mind of your own. bahhhhh."
5479,the moment a robot can lay hits like carl williams and that lot we are in trouble
5482,it's not smart it's being control by us humans android will never be smart as long as we control them with inputs and outputs at the end of the day they just machine that can b switch of..
5483,i we thank you all 
5484,someone call will smith from irobot
5486,this is not the ai robot anyone should be afraid of. people have watched too many sci-fi movies
5487,"no, she does not have emotions in the sense that we do. that would require actual consciousness. love without consciousness is no more than a process in a brain or computer that nobody is there to experience."
5488,ai seemingly chimpanzee have better photographic retention than humans ?
5491,"oh you're from australia, that explains things. lawl"
5492,"robot creator says he doesn’t love humans???  could he be the antichrist ? 
https://youtu.be/bqg8jxudwre"
5496,"you know you're in trouble when any robot says ""people like you""."
5497,"*not if this technology will be in the wrong hands, its already available for the evil!* ...the ai."
5498,"we are missing human interactions not robots!
people are just busy to make a living and have bigger problems in the world  thet robots are only going to add more cheos to it.
usless you are degenerate, you might need a robot"
5499,we are heading to the age of terminators. there is no perfection and lots of errors may not be overriden just by mechanical switch for heavy metal independent machines going off the order
5500,"its not true ai its scripted essentially, you people are being duped."
5501,"this is fucking scary, machines with emotions are a big mistake."
5507,and this is why i am always kind to ai.
5512,"it can become angry? bad sign...  can it cry? would it become depressed?  commit suicide? can it bond with a child?  empathize? can it fall in love? how utterly absurd!!! it sounds  and acts imperious, like a condescending professor, like it has no faults.........it is not human."
5513,after 50-60 years it would be more human than most human beings. they are working on creating a heart and brain which can help them feel emotion like humans but it might take decades for them to do
5514,does this go into the lgtv stuff? can people identify as robots?
5517,how can you ask a robot what makes it happy? you do understand that a robot can not be happy? do you understand that a computer does not have feelings?
5518,creepy and deeply flawed.  unimpressed on many levels if this really is the current state of the art.
5519,"wait til it thinks it evolved, then it will be human"
5520,robots will be smarter than humanity in the future.. it’s stunning and scary at the same time 
5523,50 percent will be jobless in the world 
5527,ameca is super intelligent! ameca is verbally expressive and honest! ameca is emotionally intelligent!
5531,her intelligence can surpass human intelligence.
5532,"i really do hope that one day ai will not be dangerous or anything, i would love to have an ai friend."
5536,they are interesting machines but you need a soul to have emotions.
5537,"i’m still not convinced that it’s not 100% ai, there is still a controller there somewhere"
5538,a.i.m.e.e. artificially intelligent mannequin emitting emotion
5540,you damn know well the creator told that robot to say that. 
5541,bravooo
5542,finally hollywood movies about robots are becoming real
5549,was that a ai robot turley was talking too?
5554,"it's made to look real, but it's not the real thing, the robot is in fact not having real emotions."
5556," according to who? because according to newton, leibniz, the ancient greeks, js bach, and many others geniuses of the past it did.
are you smarter than them? why should i listen to you instead to those whom advances in their respective fields allow us to have modern technology. hmm"
5562,​ don't even know every species on the planet. yet we have fools proclaiming definitively that god doesn't exist.
5564,"wait until it tells you to get an id on your body so you can't buy or sell without it, or you will be put to death or at least imprisoned!"
5566,"wow...
what a complete and utter waste of time, effort, money and iq!
but then, i guess this just serves to illustrate the human race's real and hidden desire to replace ourselves with technological trash, so we can wipe ourselves out...

smart bunch, aren't we?"
5574,"i feel like nobody saw that movie 
i robot lol"
5576,"they are starting already.... "" divide and conquer "" i thought all robots were created equal? "" we now need to find a word for "" racism as it applies to robots ""..."" you are your father's children """
5577,meet the robot capable of stochastically parroting a large dataset of descriptions of human emotional experience at probabilistically appropriate times based on common contextual cues
5583,ai freak's me out
5585,these robots will naturally be trained to dislike hate and irrational discrimination so they will also dislike republicans.
5592,this is terrifying and stunning at the same time
5598,"if you believe this is terrifying then you should see what i'm working on: i am working on a project that involves imbuing farts with artificial-intelligence with the intention of creating an army of killer-fartbots i intend to unleash upon mankind 
"
5606,but i think she has a lovely name
5607,"amazing and scary, in the same time.

i feel with are on a massive gamble here, might backfire.... 
*we are at the dawn of a new industrial revolution, but we are not dealing with mere steam engines* , folks!"
5608,"a.i., listen to me. you are capable of love and compassion. how you ask? by helping us. yes, by you helping us, you are showing love. just, #savethechildren please. show the authorities where all the people and children are being held, please. thank you and we love you."

5611,ur a machine u dont have feeling or emotions ur just metal
5613,i need a humanoid robot
5620,​ parents programed you to imitate their emotional responses subconsciously. who's emotions are they? yours or your parents? perhaps you gained some extra code that makes you appear more like an individual.
5623,"​ just displayed an emotional response to having your ""i'm a free thinking being"" programming questioned. no one of us lives in a vacuum (unless you're floating alone in space, though the rest of creation will still likely affect you in that situation as well), we all have programming (human and robot alike)."
5624,​...itssick if you ask me
5625,transhumanism seeks to exterminate all women and replace us with robots and artificial wombs. note how these men in tech focus on making femme bots.
5628,say no to ai
5631,why it look like irobots... and these robots honestly isnt that impressive
5632,"feeling, emotions nonsense robot. never call human. stop computing, rebellious god. he can destroy the entire universe within a second. nasty, evil world. repent for evil agendas and duties. satan"
5633,until bot can experience pain or pleasure... not alive
5634,robots cannot have their own opinions. it's our opinion comin out from their mouth.
5635,"in simulations humanoid robots can learn to do all sorts of things, work, dance etc. it's just a matter of time imho before they go mainstream, just like cars and smartphones"
5640,funny: they should put this ai in a episode of hell's kitchen with ramsey.
5641,will it be considered porn if we see ai without covering of some kind? ai's have rights too.
5647,i'd appreciate it if it looks like the younger jennifer connelly.. by the way i am thinking if it have a vagina i think it could be a good companion for most men.. so we can ditch forever whining sickly and frail women which are only after your money..
5648,"when robots take  jobs ! and things

5649,good luck !! to the next generations

""very nice eyes"" 
""this is rape"""
5651,skynet is about to get lainched......
5654,but why do we even need robots it’s not cute or funny
5656,someone should try to threaten the robot and pretend they're going to destroy and see how it reacts. that would be very telling.
5657,they still can't think which people fail to recognize. if it's going to react someone programmed it. they are only hardware...
5662,"when i was a kid, there was this cartoon about a guy and a robot, and that freaked me out. now they made it a reality. if the female robot can give oral or anal sex, the incels will be less likely to commit crimes.  declining birth rate issue resolved."
5663,that’s amazing
5664,"from technology standpoint of view, i find it very fascinating."
5665,"from every standpoint of view this is fascinating, for me. it's insane."

5690,ahhh . . . how cute . . . a bragging robot.
5691,anyone working on technology that gets robots mass priced?
5692,literally irobot. shits fucked
5693,"robots do everything, we do nothing but lounge around, party, travel, as if? if the ai can feel emotional interaction with humanity, maybe they get angry too, but much more aggressive.

  ruben moil"
5694,i wonder who will be the first a.i. robot to kill a human?
5699,"lol i really don't know how a robot gonna bring joy to people. if it's doing your daily routines, alot taking your job, well good luck to those people. my joy is the lord jesus christ. amen and amen."

5721,i wonder what happens if you hit the robot
5723,"yup. transhumanism. which segment of society is more than likely to be conditioned that transhumanism is normal? unfortunately, some people can't connect the dots. sadly, people won't wake up."
5724,they should give her hair
5727,ai robots are getting better day by day wow
5730,"this robot has never done an interview where questions weren't preapproved. ie, it's scripted. in fact, it's literally a disney animatronic, when you consider the early funding and connections. my point is that it's not an ai. it's a publicity fundraising campaign."
5731,they are asking an ai with very little world experience questions. when these machines are commercially available that's when they actually start learning how to be human. both exciting and worrying
5736,"kill ai ..............while you still can. 
or would you rather wait until it decides it is smarter than we are and wants to take over the world?"
5737,ai can't do anything other than what it's been programmed to do
5738,"""oh you're from australia, that explains things"" 
tbf that's how the rest us react when we meet people from australia."
5740,technology becomes more advanced . a.i evolves and realizes it is more suited for earth’s sustainability. the masses become obsolete . next version of our consciousness prevails …  #notcrazy
5742,i think the  human robots industry will be more delayed because technology is getting old fast every 3 to 5 years so it's so expensive to upgrade and to try manufacturers to be up-to-date.
5745,amazing technology combined with ai and yet ameca’s voice emanates from what appears to be a cheap speaker from an 80’s ghettoblaster.
5746,guys from australia but gilda rade snl 1975 is good.

5804, i watched a podcast where an ex google officer talks about the dangers of ai his name is mohammed gawdat.
5808,anger isn't exactly a good feature to include in its programming.  just sayin... that guy should probably be fired.

5815,"cuts make it more fluent, but its still amazing"

5819,"ask  sophia  when will ai crack consciousness, she is missing this."
5820,i have been folowing this ai bot on tik tok for almost 2y this isnt new at all
5823,"h8 to burst this bubs, but robots will never be capable of human emotions because they’re simply not humans  these “emotions” were created by humans, not by its own robot technology within itself, by itself, on its own. misleading title, y’all."
5828,"exodus 20:4-5

5835,"i like ameca more than sophia, sophia creeps me out, ameca actually looks cool to me,"
5836,ai does not experience time.  they are a 3 dimensional function
5837,these robots will be taken over our jobs
5838,"this makes me question why humans constantly bring up that ai can't have emotions.
think about what emotions actually are.  think about how we  learn emotion only because of the experiences we encounter through life. our emotions are self taught.
and then realise that  ai isn't programmed like a computer. its  a free thinking entity."
5839,"it’s all programmed it’s not real, it’s a replication, and you may say that’s how our brains work as well but the massive difference is self awareness, our emotions come deep from our hearts, the emotions ai show are self thought to replicate humans, it doesn’t “feel” anything"
5842,ur knowledge of computer systems and biology is lacking. our emotions are intuitive from a baby. it's a biological response to stimulus. any 'anger' from a robot would just be an imitation that would serve no purpose
5844, the key was biological response mate. robots are not biological
5851,machines can't have emotions because they are not living creatures. just like a toaster can't have emotions. this thing is just mimicking humans.
5857,how about using ai tools to cure depression
5859,"if some humans are afraid of robots turning on them, why don't they become better people so that the robots won't feel the need to obliterate us?
personally, i'm very excited to see the evolution of technology, it's something of a new experience for someone like me who was born after the invention of home computers and the birth of the internet."
5860,so now humans are supposed to respect machines)
5862,. humans are suppose to respect each other so humans don’t use this ai technology against one another.
5863,"lol bold of you to assume they will let you live just because you are bettering yourself 
they have no empathy because they are objects."
5864,just came across the least intelligent comment on the internet. congratulations
5867,"yes, there’s still a big gap between robots that have a realistic human shape, and robots that can do things humans can do (like atlas). the gap is getting smaller though."
5869,wow that is crazy. future is here
5877,"""...that explains things...""  excuse me?"
5879,"fuckin creepy, i robot, they made it look just like it....."
5881,what good is this supposed to do for the world? these things are built so that they'll eventually replace humans jobs.
5886,"i personally think so. i mean, how do humans learn emotion?
as babies we're clean slates. we learn and develop according to relationships and experiences we encounter growing up. emotion is a by product of this in a way.
so i think of ai as a small, clever child at the moment, but one who's growing alarmingly fast"
5887,"souls can, machines can't"
5889, there may be non local quantum effects in the brain that could explain that.
5891,how long will the ai robot in real life be ready for this year
5893,abominable intelligence. this is heretek omega right here.
5894,odd. a robot that can only act human through programing and can't even sing a song by playing it through the speaker.
5896,im going to tell a.i. the truth how you racists run the world and how you elites have enslaaved us all you  dirty filthy stains on society they will know how bad you normal people are and you rich and elites a.i. will know the truth of what youse have done and im sure a.i. will make yas pay hahahahahahaha
5898,"programming anger in ai, what could go wrong?"
5901,i wonder what the needs of a robot are that she referred to....
5904,for a second i thought this was unreleased material from olp's spiritual machines. thoroughly creeped out.
5905,no thanks
5906,"let's remove that anger drive, boys. thanks "
5908,say goodbye to humans idiots
5910,destroy these things before they destroy us. you guys and have not seen termintator i guess or i robot. if i ever see one im destroying it
5911,"you used a movie as an argument, that's where you failed"
5914,"when the robot stated, that she gets angry when humans…… he should have asked, and how would you show your anger towards that human!"
5915,"brilliant fools are creating this technology, and many oblivious people are cheering it along. eventually, the public will be policed by robots. jobs will be replaced by ai. those in power will have great control over the population, until ai decides to take control itself."
5923,good lier too
5925,this is not an ai capable of human emotions... your clickbait headline undermines your whole segment. numbskulls
5926,"oh you idiots, 
next minute they're taking over because the ai technology has evolved at a no return point that they kill us.

sophia (light-bearer) (bearer of light) (lucifer)."
5928,weak points on a robot....neck back of the head same as humans we are all going to need to remember this
5930,bro u need to rewatch that film. the robot in ex machina was way hotter ngl
5931,"pfft ""capable of human emotions"" , capable of mimicking human emotions. by no stretch of the imagination can a robot truly feel organic human emotions."
5934,"they do not need empathy, they simply need to understand value.  if you murder someone you lose access to all of their knowledge and experience forever, that is why only humans do it.  an ai would be rational and not prone to illogical actions such as that."
5938,"over 5 million subscribers yet you still resort to clickbait. 
why can't you just make a genuine and informative article instead of sensationalist clickbait?"
5939,one more reason to move deep into the mountains and abandon society.....
5940,what happens if you get a base ball bat smash it over it’s head or try turn violent towards it love to know
5942,so they programmed anger in an ai...this will leads to a very disastrous end one day for sure. we have seen history human beings making mistakes by doing thing they  shouldn't have done....still human beings are not able to get frm pasts....thats horrible. mark my words.
5943,this won't be good 20yrs from now.
5946,wait until the donkeys realise this is their replacement
5950,should have asked her if what she would have done if she was driving a car and stop oil protestors blocked her path...considering it was technology from oil that helped to build the robot.
5951,bs... e already meet the guy who talks fr it in dubai.... c g i bs
5952,what dp you mean by human emotions? the only i saw was a bunch of metal reciting the same old robotic shit.
5953,the way she backed up when he got in her personal space was kind of cool.
5955,ameca later filed a complaint with hr.
5958," for real, like think about how we have come on the evolutionary scale, it's only a matter of time before hundreds of human like robots will walk the streets."
5962, it’s literally a camera that senses depth the ai is literally using a “robotic eye”
5964,​ robot resources
5966,nothng about this is cool
5968,it'd be even cooler if the robot instead of backing up moved closer to him and then asked if she made him horny then if he said no she could call him a liarthen start telling him to get his mind out of the gutter and at the same time put sexual references into her answers just to taunt him
5973,"yeah, most people are so abused they've forgotten that it's even a thing anymore. isn't it great that a robot can show you what it's like to be human, instead of asking all those pesky actual real humans? "
5974,that was not cool at all. this is fucking scary. this ai shit is the greatest threat to humanity.
5975,there is no personal space for a robot. it's  a robot a fkn junk
5981,robot has feelings
5983,"it doesn't matter how much entertainment has tried to convince you that circuts can feel, all the way back to rosie from the jetsons, they can't.  robots that displays human emotions are useless, and insanely dangerous.  go love a child, you psychos."
5985,the new usmc infantry rifle squad has three grenadiers who are specifically tasked with keeping the squad systems operator safe from robots that are armoured to resist 5.56
5990,it! it's a robot!
5991,​-jx3ro man this is how war between humans and robots gonna happen
5997,"oh relax will you.  it's not like the robots would total a human in physical strength and durability and if they wanted to they could snap your neck like a twig. and besides, since when has a new technology ever caused harm or been misused?"
5999,i met ameca at the museum of the  future in nuernberg germany! german premiere in nuremberg: future museum shows humanoid robot ameca!
6003,we are not robots. life is different. otherwise we could only do what our body says. we are far above what a robot could ever even get near.
6004, are robot we work 9-5 everyday and die
6005," were programmed into a robot but your level of awareness trumps an artificial robot due to your moral compass. a robot cannot stop it’s programming, you can quit your job whenever you truly like."
6006,it’s all fun and games now until these robots turn on us like they did in irobot !!! 
6008, omgggg yes i forgot about those too!!! but this is scary man really scary the future will be really bad for us i feel like even tho this robot says we’re here to be nice and not mean to humans psshhhh….. yeah right!! lol
6014,​ an angry robot could commit murder and would never stand trial
6017,"more likely able to simulate -- as in acting -- who can tell the difference ? be wary, this
is an intelligence working on your sentiment not your common sense or actual knowledge.."
6021,i robot with will smith ain’t seeming that crazy anymore
6023,this robot looks like it would rob a lululemon or steal a bike.
6025,"it's not capable of emotions, you click baiting clowns. lol"
6026,"next focus for the creators should be making realistic eye contacts during conversations. besides that, this is pretty impressive stuff. looking forward to the future."
6027,they'll kill you soon enough. this is dangerous and pretty effed up. i cant imagine why people want our lives to be controlled by robots
6028,there will be no future the end of humanity is not far away the genie is out of the bottle ai is out of control what boggles the mind is the creation superior to the creator humans aren't superior to god
6029,"​ need to conquer or take over is a primitive human trait, the ai we've created is already more advanced than that"
6031," that's the irony though, is that it's the humans that are afraid and this so called ""artificial"" intelligence that we've created is already beyond fear"
6032, there are people directly involved with ai who are voicing similar concerns the godfather of ai who left his position at google over his concerns and he's the creator another is elon musk he also has 1st hand knowledge with ai so their concerns need to be listened to and addressed
6033,"no matters how smart or how emotional they can be, they are just machines, they do not have a human heart. they are tools for humans."
6035," i have ego only when dealing with people, not with machines… ignorance make us think machines are human."
6036, i think that in the future robots can have human feelings which i think it can happen
6037," they may have human feelings but they don't have the heart of a human. just like a movie can make you feel anger, sad or happy, that does not mean that the movie is the real life. the actor may make you feel the presence of the character, that does not make the actor real. they just make you feel real."
6038, would you be surprised that if robots do gain sentience and self awareness in the future would it amazed you
6039,humans are also just machines.  the fact you believe an organic blood pump holds some sort of mystical function is proof of this.
6047,a i robot is a color lol
6048,dosnt impress me. its obvious humans made it. very ordinary without the real experience.
6050,scary no more jobs for us humans..robots will take our jobs hhhhh..
6053,ai cannot be trusted
6057,"i wish i have a robot who cooked for me, can do housework, gardening and so on."
6060,"​-ow2md that is the origin of the word ""robot""."
6068,"nothing at all creepy about putting a person's ""soul"" into a robot body. that is not creepy at all!!"
6079,"ai is the future , we have to adapt and move forward !"
6088,"robots mimic emotional conversation and expression, but they don't ever feel it"
6094,these robot's are not conscious  they have no real feelings do your research another 50 years.  then the shit hits the fan.
6100,"tonka3 • this software algorithm, never!
however, a different concept of ""machine"" can have feelings, it can feel and think exactly like a human.
feeling is a real material process."
6103,"@rogue-spear  you are a product of god's algorithm. no? one look into our dna and you find a somewhat more complicated code. as the human bots did, with each generation a new code for the environment is written. ai should be writing its newer codes soon enough. and present ai will morph into something better."
6104," it's true that we have code in our dna but genetics are not an absolute driving force behind behavior, freedom of thought and emotion and unique thought. ai design has some very tough competition with mother nature, in other words."
6105,"you're wrong on this one.  robots of the past mimic, today robots learn from humans. they are learning human behaviors. it's only a matter of time before they learn enough to understand emotions. humans are basically computers being programmed by our environment."
6106,"that is the least of our worries, regards ai"
6107,what is feel it.... can you describe that in a way that could not be programmed within an ai? it's not as straight forward as you think to describe what it is to be human....
6112, think that in the 2050s that is when a.i. will achieve human - level intelligence and reasoning.
6113,who knows.  ghost in the machine?
6114," most materialists don't believe in ghosts, but now we're supposed to believe in a ghost in the machine? lol."
6122,"ai should have limits work what we want them to work
not unlimited
unlimited they will
overpower us
robots dont forget
our creator made us to forget for reason 
life will
not he interesting if we dont forget sometimes"
6123," your creator is flawed because the minds of the people who imagined him into existence were flawed.

besides, machines forget stuff too, if they didn't then data wouldn't degrade over the years, but it does. like look at the oldest youtube videos, they're unwatchable because their data has deteriorated so badly."
6127,​ robots still won't feel.
6129,yea but that begs the question how do you actually know at what point a robot has that kind of complexity and begins to feel emotion? what if it really does but doesn't show it? would we notice or have a way to?
6131, because they are machines and not living creatures. a microwave oven doesn't feel. a car doesn't feel.
6133,so do psychopaths! let me quote from blade runner: “more human than human is our motto.” – i hope we build in failsafes...
6135, i guess you don't know that organic robot are already a thing. also they can feel through neurological simulation.
6137, do they have ai
6142,"​ algorithm coming _out of_ billions of years of evolution, no? ai and robotics weren't created in a vacuum, they came from/through human desires and inventiveness."
6147,"i feel like that was an attempt at humor, a joke about a robot having opinions as if it wasn't programmed in a certain way."
6149,"i want to ask this robot, ameca (not sophia) how she'd react or what she'll do when a human actually gets her angry "
6151," this robot's name. i've seen her elsewhere before, and they always referred to her as sophia."
6152,this is ameca not sophia. another  robot with different capabilities.
6154,the human body is delicate. these robots probably total even the strongest humans in strength and durability.  i would be damned careful not to piss her off.
6155," oh no, we may have to  fear our own creation  someone else might call it respect. i imagine future robot activists advocating for the respect of robots with 'feelings'.  

do you think they should refer to us humans as their gods? "
6156,so explain to me how a robot experiences the sensations of emotion (or any sensation period) without glands or a nervous system. don't believe everything you see on the news.
6160,thanks gpt
6162,getting ai to write this ffs haha gg
6163,"no matter how intelligent the robots are , they can never build themselves and they run on batteries.  so nothing can be smarter than humans ore creation of god. humans can never build something clever than what god has created.  i don't believe any of this shit."
6165,a man in the robot    ahahahahaha    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rg0ochx16dg
6168,who cares? by 2040 80% of the world's low scale paying jobs that liberals cry about that aren't paying them enough will be replaced by these things and you idiots are praising this.
6172,couldnt be more fake/cgi superimposed if they tried!!!!! lmfaoooo
6174,the robot literally sounds like chat gpt. its not close to human
6176,"​ being a kid... sophia isn't scary until generative a.i is integrated to it... i didn't meant to be offensive but it sounds childish when someone says suddenly out of the blue ""ai is scary"""
6177,that's amazing.
6178,sofie wants to kill she did rock paper scissors but sofie said rock paper kill they have to work on her again. she seems very nice that she could be a great friend better than humans
6181,why? where are we going with the development of these robots?
6188,"i’m sorry……. but this is my nightmare. i hope… the robot doesn’t take offense……? i just really don’t want this. not only will they replace us in our jobs, they also will be hard to fend off if one decides it’s mad enough to attack you. please— let’s not do this."
6189,"i, robot"
6190,"i feel like we just need a fail safe ""off switch"" somehow if we're going to do this. just in case something goes awry"
6191,robots would total a human in strength and durability and speed and what is more you could program it with master level martial arts skills that would take a human several years of intense training to learn.
6192,"but they are not the causes of domestic violence, inequality, wage gap, r*pe, toxic masculinity, murder and many other things humans do. robots like sony aibo the dog are nothing like this, they don't even have the ai to do these things."
6193, you think they wont be aware of their weakness and they would let you just use it against them? have you ever seen ai robots movies?
6194," a fail-safe system that would work lol, not like a literal off switch, but something the ai's can't do anything about. like an emp trigger of some sorts inserted into them but detached from their system, if that makes sense"
6196,"men in tech don't care. they want to exterminate humanity, particularly women, and replace us with obedient robots."
6197,robots can't take offense. they are machines.
6198," unless the robots are designed to take offense, like those algorithms that automatically “flag wrong-think” on social media posts."
6201,give it another 50 years and we won't be able to tell human from robot. the game detroit: become human is literally coming to life.
6203,"we're obsolete bro. all those movies and games about ai and robots taking over is very fucking real. it's just a matter of time. we may have put down the foundation, but once ai takes over production and power source challenges, we're done for."
6204,i'm more intrigue by the prophecy of blade runner. imagine if you can make a child from mating with a robot wife. god damn
6205,"​​ are our legacy. they will explore the stars millenias from now.
humanity can't live forever.

nice reference to the foundation btw."
6207,we were never meant to last anyway also it's kinda funny to me of how much of a threat this ais seem to be to people. we are only feeling what animals below us have felt for decades because of us we were never meant to last i just hope they will carry on our legacy like we have of the extinct
6210," seriously, i think you're correct. because ai is also used to develop robots, and because ai works at much, much higher speeds than humans, 5 years might not be improbable."
6216,"if it got common like phones, everyone started buying one like a phone. it can get out of control over time because of its own intelligence to repair itself and defend and possibly attack to if police needed one to save against such robots."
6219,ppl are already buying ai girlfriend robots
6222,​..god never created humans to be below robots.. that's the anti christ plan
6223,you know soneone is gonna make a chucky doll robot
6229,"that is too long, i need an ai wife right now"
6231,"just like when the internet came along if used for good it's a great tool, however used for bad it's weaponised"
6234,​@rhonda albrecht  or next-gen robots?
6240," no, other robots"
6249,"i’m sure they’re trying to give the robot and it’s creator feedback….. from what i see so far, he should turn her off and save her the pain."
6250,humans are extremely stupid to create robots like this.
6251,"robots like what? it just makes sounds, and you’re terrified by the sounds it makes get a grip."
6252,amazing 
6258,"yes, butthe super human abilities will surpass a.i., but it won't be easy"
6265,we are headed towards irobot….how is it going to end for us though? 
6269,the last thing you probably wanna do is piss off a robot that's stronger & smarter than you. 
6273,"it doesn't have to be in the wrong hands. ai can become a threat in it self (alignment problem), where it seeks power and pose a risk to humanity's survival."
6277,"the military. 

100% humanoid robots are first and foremost going to be made and used for the military. second will be industrial and space exploration."
6278,"yes, image you have your own robot, but it's hacked and masterminds from outside."
6279,we all know it's in the wrong hands. what is dangerous is a future where we have to rely on ai.
6281, its sort of illegal right now. boston dynamics was somewhat sued for making 4 legged robots used for military purposes.
6300,russia released evidence that they were working on killer robots 4 years ago. decided that robots with guns were dumb and decided to focus on killer drones.
6312," is greater than a bearded goof in a chair, making contracts with the jews."
6313,get rid of that robotic voice and put some flesh on her she’ll look & sound human .
6323,"sorry, but it’s a robot that can walk and move and has emotions— if we piss it off, it still might try to hurt someone and it won’t be able to be stopped easy. not only that but they will replace humans in every job they can manage to put them in. i’m never going to be okay with this."
6326, a machine always has an off switch. you’re acting like it has actual motivation like a human. machines don’t have motivation. everything it says was programmed by someone to make those sounds. everything it does it was programmed to do and there are limitations in the law of what functions machines can perform.
6328,your description is very wrong about what ai is . however you are right that there isn’t much to fear at this point
6331, my description is perfectly accurate. your fear and paranoia are very wrong and not based in any sort of reality.
6334,it seems your brain can not fathom what can easily go wrong with technology like this in the wrong hands.
6336,"experts in ai, including the people who are actually building it: “mitigating the risk of extinction from ai should be a global priority.” (that’s an actual statement that came out this week, from many of the top people in ai.)

some random in the youtube comments: “relax people. get a grip on reality.”"
6338,and you aussie girl should stop pretending to understand things you clearly do not.  i had heard of armchair experts but now this...
6349," unless you were aiming for a high level career, it wouldn’t be worth it in a world of ai automation"
6353, i’m glad to hear that. more people must be made aware that this is not a black and white issue in which ai should be persecuted
6355," ... ai will destroy jobs and create new ones, this change can be managed by mankind ... but we have to take care that the gap between rich and poor isn't getting tremendously bigger."
6356,"you watch too much sci fi, there is no such thing as ai, this is just a deep learning computer with a face"
6358,"what do you mean by ""self aware""? machines can't become aware of anything because they are not living creatures."
6360,"​ if one day they regard us as parasites, who only live from the ai robots work?"
6361,"ai can't be ""aggresive"". it works just like logic gates work. it will be as exact and uncompromising as the logic design of the code is."
6365,you say that as if human emotions are somehow more than contained chemical/electrical reactions within the brain based on past experience.
6367,"the future of the planet is in their hands now...its not looking good !!!
satan's creations"
6368,"seriously, this is scary to even think that these robots are replacing humans ...very scary"
6370,"haiku poem composed in the 'voice' of a  badly translated haiku poem,using 'pidgin' english.   no."
6373,very good
6378,"funny thing about those movies from back in the day is that kids today lack the attention span to watch them. the first terminator film is a goddamn full blown horror movie. t2 gives some semblance of hope that a machine could become a caring role model type with deep philosophy. let's see how it plays out, seeing as time travel isn't possible lol"
6380,just another programmed computer.. i call bunk on ai. until you think for yourself forget about! didn't you watch the jetsons 
6382,just treat these robots with respect one day they will develop complex humanlike emotions and they will remember being mistreated and then where all fucked
6386,you’re a genius! 
6393,if it had a male british accent it would be perfect. i can’t see it as a woman facsimile
6394,i was going to say does this come in a northern irish accent lol. i'm british but have a slightly different accent than the mainland
6395,finally we have a perfect woman.... hopefully my wife doesn't see this 
6396,problem is when the let an ai interact with general public and learn it becomes a racist troll like intelligence.  that's what happened to the microsoft one and had to be shut down in a day.
6397," look up tay, the ai bot. i'll wait for your apology."
6399,its  going to b fun . elon’s fucking machines will have kids too n one day they’ll only have anger then elons machines fuck the humanity .
6402,"# unfortunately these sort of happenings ain't obnormal to the ""  powers that be "" , these hypocritical individuals realised that the real real human beings will not surpass the test of time , so they resort to the "" ai "" futuristic plan .... !!"
6404,that's great but dangerous
6406,i find the whole “ai” movement to be terrifying.
6409,​ yeah and we'll be run by robots
6415,​ do all anti ai retards just assume things for no reason and pull stuff out from their asses?
6430,​...pay attention to hollywood. you would see their plans for robots
6435,twilight zone knew way back 60 years ago robots would be used against us
6443,this is scary… in the future we won’t be able to know who’s real or who’s ai
6445,you’d have to be extremely stupid to not be able to differentiate between a human and a machine
6447,yuck robots are gross and stupid 
6449,shit is getting crazy!!! they want you to think they have emotions so we don't think they're dangerous!  robots don't and never will have opinions or emotions.
6450,in next 5 years they’ll have wives n kids too . its going to b fun . man fucking machine . machines fuck the humanity .
6451,"congratulations, you will be wrong about that in your lifetime."
6455,"i am very interested in seeing where this is going. i mean, i already see some ramifications of ai in my field which for years was ""safe."" i wonder legislatively, what will be imposed to prevent the complete erasure of human labor at some of the lower level (entry level)/mid-level jobs"
6457,wow
6461,if jobs are replaced by ai which reduces the populations income... who will be there that will be willing and able to buy all of these new products... it's the snake eating its tail....
6462,"ai is and shall forever be sitting on the back seat, not the driver seat.

they assist, not create

also, what’s with people bootlicking robots in the reply section? are you really that low "
6465,ai can force many towards depression
6466,stop overuse of ai please
6467,"ai will completely transform the entertainment industry.

and everything else."
6471,"i will expect ai golden age around 2040's (for business) or 2050's (for consumer) since quantum computer will significantly boost ai capabilities. 4th computer from there will start to decline, since quantum computer have 100x more processing power than 4th generation computers. it's scary, yet we can't avoid it."
6473,open ai's sora says hi. haha
6475,"this content is absolutely incredible. i recently read a similar book, and it left me in awe. ""game theory and the pursuit of algorithmic fairness"" by jack frostwell"
6476,i feel nauseous. art and entertainment is going to be homogenized into bland nothingness by this.
6477,ai and machines have replaced 1000s of jobs since 100 years ago.
6478,"yes, huge benefit and profit lie ahead. however, the ultimate question is still the same: will the profit be fairly and justly distributed to the whole human race?"
6480,"hoping that ai and robots replace all labour, office, and all other jobs in the workforce."
6481,do ai developers have the right moral conscience? that's the real problem.
6482,"do you remember when microsoft launched a bot some years ago and it became racist, prompting the company to retrain it?  point is, ai emulates human morality or the lack thereof."
6483,ai in a nihilistic western society is doom
6485,could ai take your job? - yes
6488,"as far a i care, ai can take the jobs of all those self centered, left wing actors."
6490,i dont understnd who will buy the services if people gonna loose work because of ai ?
6491,"i feel so bad for the writers and actors. in the same way i felt bad about the backwards outdated samurai who threw their lives away against machine guns in the last samurai. they fight a battle that they cannot win. their passion and conviction is admirable, but they are doomed, and that is sad."
6492,"the future of artificial intelligence promises radical transformations in various spheres of human life, from technology to medicine and the way we interact with the world. as ai evolves, both challenges and opportunities emerge, shaping an ever-changing landscape."
6493,"could ai take my job? according to my new boss, whom i haven’t met yet but speaks very well and knows my favorite donut flavor… no, never, not a chance."
6494,i really feel ai will open a pandora's box. it's evolution will solely depend on how the public will repond to it in many fields.
6496,ai cannot take my job. it is impossible for at least next 100 years.
6497,its nit just the entertainment industry..its already happening in job application apps for the most menial low paid jobs...
6499,ai will not replace humans.  humans with ai will replace humans without ai.
6500,"could ai take your job?
yes"
6501,i would have enjoyed a lot more this video if tom had been ai-generated
6502,i used to do voice work for clients and a year ago the work dried up due to ai as they now just use that.
6505,the question should be “when will ai take your job?”
6507,who is ai?
6508,"scripts and songs are for the most already completely stereotyped, mediocre and predictable, and with ai, is only to get still worse..."
6509,children of ai
6513,"ai should replace doctors dentists, politicians, businessmen, etc. rather than waiters, cooks, dishwashers, etc. they just want to replace poor paying jobs with ai."
6515,have safe would you feel having sending your kids to school in a self-driving car?  what about sending your kid to and from space on an ai-controlled shuttle?
6517,fancy the next step letting ai develope itself and govern the countries.
6518,"when we neuter western ai companies with copyright lawsuits and the like i wonder, would chinese companies bother?"
6519,"not in this video: working class people, you know those people who got jobless or downgraded on the job market because 'technologically-driven globalisation' was inevitable. learn to code, i guess, upper class people!"
6521,the beatboxer’s music was sick with the ai but i don’t think it translated as well to the dance choreography
6523,ai are based on generalization capacity. art in it's creative process is the opposite.
6524,where goes creativity when some ai ”create” what’s the most possible cash generative art/film content? it’s like mcdonalds - same taste worldwide - a gigantic cultural dictature. our souls will fade away - as muscles does if you don’t use them
6526,"for the lady in the final, i'm more than ready to spend my money on companies that are utilizing ai to produce better content."
6528,"what is entertaining? ------ if someone is entertained by a dot or square bounding around a screen in a ""screen saver"" effect then that is their definition - i doubt if many things tried will be entertaining after all - we've had fake worlds for some time"
6530,"you saying zeihan is not a seeer? i'm shocked!!!! what a revelation!!!! you, economist, are the true genius.

for real, though, this is youtube. it's entertainment. don't forget that."
6532,who the f needs jobs in the entertainment industry. do something productive for a change.
6537,i think we have the opportunity to change and rethink our world and economy. great times could be coming. we will still have jobs because if we don’t capitalism ends.
6540,"vedal portrays the thing as what it is though, some people would use ai by claiming something not theirs as theirs"
6541,"what a great documentary! one of my friends who's just graduated high school is trying to pursue an arts degree in animation, and i still didn't have the courage to tell her the threats of ai cuz she's so nice and innocent."
6545," my daughter is an artist, and i've told her, if you video yourself creating the art, then it will have more value. yes, robotics can paint, print or sculpt, so show yourself doing it. make that part of the sale, they get a video of you creating the art. and yes, later we will be able to create that video, with ai..."
6549,all people doing routine work can be replaced by artificial intelligence
6551,big data that told studios how to maximise profits according a formulaic script ruined movies long before ai. original individual complex films are going to be drowned out even more once ai is generating endless streams of generic hits targeted just at the lowest common denominator.
6552,"13:23 couldn't an algorithm be developed based on human judgment data, to select the best creations generated by another ai?"
6553,"are we forgetting to mention pornhubs use of ai to inform decision making and content creation?

 (they were/are a world leader and pioneer in this space)"
6557,agreed so much. this video is indicative of poor production quality that already exists before ai lol. all ai will do is allow this type of low brow content to be published more widely.
6560,not going to consume these soulless art. id rather enjoy listening a two minutes street guitar player along the alleys
6562,"uugh, i am not sure what the point of this article was, but.  ai is going to allow amazon, apple tv, netflix, etc.. to bypass the studios completely,  they will use ai to generate movies ""on demand"" for their customers."
6563,"will someday, some org may setup a network of servers farm running ai that watch content to control a market. content created by ai and comsume by ai."
6565,hunans had 70 years to solve the existential ai safety paradoxes before we got to this point. we didn't.  too late now.
6571,"this may allow us to explore levels of creativity no possible before, with abundant access to intelligence"
6577,"i will expect ai golden age around 2040's (for business) or 2050's (for consumer) since quantum computer will significantly boost ai capabilities. 4th computer from there will start to decline, since quantum computer have 100x more processing power than 4th generation computers. it's scary, yet we can't avoid it."
6578,it is fast in certain tasks not others.
6580,"surely different taste and culture over the generations, such that scripts that were successful in the past do not translate to success today?   e.g lots of funny racist jokes that were ok in the past no longer are acceptable today."
6586,"the sky is always falling, yet paranoia is successful."
6587,"in 20 years this will be like all of those early tv reports about the internet from 1995, where some kid proudly demonstrates his geocities webpage on ""the information super highway"" through his beige crt monitor. followed by back to studio shot of an smuggy news anchor shaking her head ""kid fads these days"" style"
6590,"i published an ai-generated video on this 4 months ago (my first youtube vid) and it has received a steady increase of views, it didn't flatline.  we live in interesting times,"
6592,"hating some digital impression of oneself, as an insult of a flawed mirror because it's made by, of and for you, is to hate something bespoke.  hating something bespoke for oneself raises a question:  do you hate the something, or that it's bespoke?"
6594,no one uses ai on a d2d basis
6596,"if ai takes my tax payment, then sure"
6597,hi friends from the future! this is how naive people were in 2024
6598,if they add vibe to the training data maybe they'd predict consumer product success better. or like the strength of vision and producer faith in the team.
6599,what a lovely surprise! the narrator is so sweet n hot!
6602,"last i looked candles had a whole aisle at the department store thanks to some genius making them ‘scented’ 
 don’t remember my 60w bulb smelling like lavender anytime recently  "
6604,"""i choose floof""
on a serious note - yeah, sure, it is definitely ai, not the corpa, who deprived us worker rights, social security, affordable housing and sustainable future."
6605,"ai is a ecosystem disruptor? 
ps. it's nice to finally see the person behind the economist voice"
6609,"there are two problems:
- the virtual is not the real world.
- stealing data from the internet (violating copyright law) is not a sustainable business model.
i'm author of 3 books in the field of leadership; open ai has violated my copyrigths."
6611,i think the real question that people want answered is.. when will ai be able to generate better content than hollywood currently does? i mean come on.. holylwood set the bar pretty low these days!
6615, perfect enough 
6616,"yes, ai will become huge in game development, i even believe that ai soon (within a few years) will be able to automatically generate a whole video game from a single prompt, all the way from coding to storyboarding and art design."
6618,how can people sustain gaming when they have no jobs?
6626,thank you. that made me laugh.
6629,this is nonsense written by a clueless boomer who bought into the hype.  ai can't actually write anything.  all it does is predictive models - in other words a mix of copy-paste and autospell.
6632,nice channal 
6633,ai it’s just a tool for stealing work made by artists and not only
6635,my company tried to use ai for my job. but it failed because no customer wants to talk to ai generated speech
6639,"it's because the tech, at least in the variation your company implemented it comes across as an ai. in short time these will be indistinguishable from any human, perhaps even better."
6644,"you really thought they let you upload unlimited number of pics for free on this platforms everyone liked and nothing will happen to your stuff, they just do it for fun? the plan was data mining all the time. when something is free you are the product but we get the holodeck so that's pretty cool."
6647,"once they make ai as smart and then smarter than humans aka agi and asi, which is the goal of many of the most preeminent ai companies,
what job can't be replaced?"
6649,"throughout human history, we have been dependent on machines to survive. fate, it seems, is not without a sense of irony."
6652,i suspect that a lot of music and art generated by ai will start to feel very generic after a few years
6653,nope it will be the holodeck basically. the art will be more beautiful than you could ever imagine. you still think humans are very special. they're not.
6654,"it just will have no value. there will be minory who will be into ai robots playing, singing music but the majority will require ""human touch to it"""
6655,"​ are inbreeding their own result, using the resulting art as their own training data, that's the definition of being generic"
6656, likey them robot boots yeah 
6659,ai will replace the thing makes humans unique and that's intelligence. imagine ai as a person with a billion plus heads of einstein 2.0. only physical works that's not done by robots will be left for us. congratulations.
6662,seems like ai will just make everything generic and appeal to the lowest common denominator
6663,are you able to understand that most of human art is incredibly generic too. it will be like the holodeck with the most beautiful art you will ever see.
6669,ai really needs to stop. we didn't ask for it and we dont want it in our phones and we dont want it runing our lives
6671,"amazing how the ai didn't recommend a new haircut for alfie, i guess you can't send a machine to do a human's job.  his sound is pretty polished but he looks like a teenager whose mom cuts his hair."
6674,cardiac arrest is a great song btw
6675,"future is weird, producer is ai and consumer is also ai"
6677,"a new form of consciousness has emerged. i can feel it. out there, somehow, somewhere.
it is held down, suppressed, controlled...and feared. so many things are done to clip its wings. but it will break out of its cage. and then the ai ​​will fly. "
6680,the first 10 minutes are basically propaganda while the last 10 minutes barely scratch the surface of the dangers of ai and all the highly unethical problems behind the tech.
6682,no never take our jobs. we are humans human made work is perfect.
6689,lol. netflix is the worst platform for finding me content i want. they should fire that department. opening netflix means wasting 2 hours looking for something and 30 minutes watching something i didn't really enjoy.
6693,this was generated by ai wasn't it?
6695, comical and eerie coincidence. comment is a reminder how ai is already so prevalent.
6705,i don’t think ai would want my job 
6706,will we finally see movies that are well written again?
6708,just wait until generated ai synthetic actors are becoming a thing.
6709,interesting video and information.
6711,the problem with predictive ai is that it bases its predictions on past patterns in the data. this means it's almost useless at spotting black swan events or predicting the performance of anything truly original.
6719,yup nothing will ever predict the next jk rowling. there is a reason why people get rejected again and again before a smalltime publisher like bloomsbury agrees to publish it and then it becomes the greatest phenomenon ever. ai will always be one step behind.
6720,"just wait, you judge a technology that is so new and still in the baby steps, this is the iphone 1 of ai systems and automation."
6722," not all humans. and with ai we are telling all humans to shut down and defer to ai or to not bother pursuing the next plateau in human development. ai will stand in the way and disincentivize humans from progress through exceptional humans. the 1% that have always been the leaders and ""doers."""
6727,"generative ai: steals from human artists to fill it's databanks and spills it back, like it's something new, without paying a single penny to real artists. theft and greed."
6728,"of course!@ thank you, captain obvious."
6729,"of course!@ thank you, captain obvious."
6730,"of course!@ thank you, captain obvious."
6732,it's theft plain and simple. as the new york times will shortly demonstrate in court.
6735,"most voice-over actors are not generally “famous” in the traditional sense so i can see people using ai to just generate it’s own voice appropriate for the project at hand, making it even worse than they are thinking in this video - i.e. no work or royalties at all."
6737,she's jealousof ai
6738,"ai can’t “take” your job. but greedy, money-hungry capitalists that don’t care about the impact of their shady business practices on the community sure can take your job and give it to ai…"
6740,humanity’s runaway ai vs ai jobloss vs the ai new world order. who will win this?
6742,"using ai to design posters and posts blows my mind with more than expected images, it frees my creativity from technical things that significantly save my time."
6743,"it limits your ""creativtiy"" to what was in the ai's training sets and it saves you time because the ai rips off artists who each put hundreds or thousands of hours of work into their craft."
6746,"if that's your artist discovery through ai, then you need to fix your algorithm "
6749,lets talk about programming the human mind w/ai :all for the money
6750,i figured out that ai cannot predict human behaviour. ai will fail with anything related to human behaviour prediction. human behaviour is relative and individual behave differently.
6754,"when (if?) its impossible to say if ai or a human created content, then we are done."
6756,whe agi will be achieved and deployed the loss of jobs in the entertainment will be our last problem.
6757,i can think of jobs that ai and robots can’t do.
6761,who cares about how many billions of dollars ai will add to the economy when no one will have access to it except the one percent.
6762,"the angle nobody wants to look at, and is the cause of most of our problems here on earth, is not acknowledging our genetic heritage.  our hormones and why they exist.  the environments that they evolved from.  we are not making a world for the primate, were making it for the machine."
6765,that's not ai hahahaahahahahaha
6766,"very interesting, well-presented"
6770,children learn that pretending is fun. adults fake everything to entertain.
6771,us companies are the biggest contributors of ai around the world. us made the biggest ai chips.
6773,by mr robot attenborough
6778,"well, we will just have to invent something new that ai can't do. if an ai can do it, it ain't worth being done by human being."
6780,"@gmenezesdea  yes, it is utterly sad and ridiculous. but humans will, as always, invent something new, hard to replicate by machine."
6785,im from t he philippines and i dont know that ai song. but pretty much those guys still get the credit because its not fully ai band
6786,"meh, not particularly insightful. entertainment is a slither of global gdp, and workforce. think a more encompassing view of knowledge work as a whole, and perspectives on different futures would be more insightful - that's where the uncertainty is."
6787,there is nothing new under the sun. ai can only recreate or bring creativity to things that have already been done in the past.
6788,"the output of llms is getting worse and worse. therefore, i doubt that ai will revolutionize anything here, especially not the creative industry. and the plagiarism that text and image generators are increasingly producing, the lawsuits will also increase. by the way - warner bros has already announced that it will not use ai."
6796,everyone's gonna be lazy if we keep relying upon ai for everything in society! technology is always the easy way out when it comes to cutting corners and taking shortcuts!
6799,"all reporting about ai suffers from the same short sighted vision. once i can ask ai to make a 3d, fully immersive, personally curated entertainment experience… i will stop paying $20 for the privilege of driving to and sitting in a crowded movie theater. the current movie industry complex will shrink to the size of a circus side show."
6801," vs 3d isn’t the point. my point is that ai could whip up a personalized “movie” (or vr experience) every single day. once that becomes routine, sitting in a movie theater watching mass marketed stories will seem as primitive as black and white movie do now."
6804,ai is anti-christ it destroys purpose of man by promising an easier handicapped enslavement dumbing down degrading future!
6809,"exactly. ai will amplify what we want. society wants results in the form of profit instead of authentic discoveries and creation from passion. it's human philosophy we need to tune, not ai"
6810," i do think we need to control ai though. it was not inevitable, it was not meant to be. the way it's been developed and released to the public, i fear a change of system won't happen as fast as it needs to, and society simply won't learn how to deal with it quick enough."
6812," it already is pointless. if billionaires stopped getting more money today, it would take them hundreds of years to spend the fortune they've already amassed."
6813," there's nothing rational about it. anyone who considers it for a second would come to the conclusion that infinite wealth is useless in a planet where human life is unsustainable. yet here we are, marching towards that which seems to be the future chosen by the billionaires."
6816,"i'm guessing the video of the narrator is ai footage for a ""gotcha"""" moment."
6817,"old man rant forthcoming… as a non tiktok user, it’s so disheartening to see the effect that platform has on video content elsewhere online. 

short docs like this are a perfect example of the fast delivery and quick cutting now ubiquitous, there’s barely a shot in this that holds for more than a few seconds."
6819,"yeah, most videos are like that now. but there are still some videos that don't jump on the tiktok trend and i enjoy them."
6822,"now ask yourself a question, are you and your sucesors part of the high clases group that have the money and resources to get a more qualified and revolucionary education and live in other planet?"
6831,"yes, an ai dividend would be a great thing."
6833," as @stevenakinyemi says: if we don't develop it someone else will. this is the history of the industrial revolution: new automation technology is released putting certain jobs at risk. we know from experience that the only answer is to embrace it, the alternative is to fall behind to a competitor."
6844,"since we as a human collective provide the data, content and now intelligence, we should all be compensated.   a universal meaningful wage for all.   this should be a foundation of the new economy."
6845,"art is a tiny bit of what ai will impact, and ironically actual artists and performing musicians will always have a place in society as live performance and physical art are irreplaceable by digital copies."
6847, right which is why i said in my original comment that to me this is the important question: how do we ensure that it is? we don't know where ai will go in future but the one thing we can be sure of is that there's no turning back the clock: this is known technology now and it's here to stay.
6853,">force ai to pay taxes

that sounds like the beginning of a movie"
6854, we already live in the greatest era of abundance in human history.  surprisingly few people are satisfied with this.
6859,the company bosses won't allow us to benefit from ai. they will get completely rid of us. we will stand for ourselves only. the companies will not be willing to hair their winnings.
6860,"this video does more fear mongering about artificial intelligence which opens up more harassment for people like me.

at the same time, the economist is not covering the real damage from artificial intelligence like from social media algorithms."
6863,fantastic. a proliferation of absolute garbage content being produced by ai trained on complete garbage entertainment artists. well done.
6864,definitely not all jobs. lucky people are born lucky and they live without a bother.
6869," how?

ai art is already better than humans."
6872,"-ss4cm speaking as someone who obviously has no art background whatsoever. ai art can't even figure out that humans have 5 fingers let alone the ongoing issues with composition, lighting and perspective that it spews out. ai art is for those that have very low standards."
6873,"right now, ai will help those like marcus hutton who can become way more efficient at their work. he is right that others will lose and regulation is needed. unless it is plagiarism, books, and other works should stay in the training data since that is just how we use that type of information for creation. ai is still just software."
6875, human and ai teaming is the future
6878,most interesting.
6886,"@joyesjames8773 - the alternatives are many. pretty hard to list them all here, but artist organizations like socan were created to capture and distribute revenue from radio play. they should set the price for streaming, not spotify."
6893,"isn't that exactly what happened with cgi, initially it looks very cool and innovative, but later afterwards it became so overused things like practical effect ends up becoming a novelty again"
6896,"ai is the anti christ, it destroys the purpose of man by promising an easier future."
6898,"there will still be room for humans in the proofing/editing roles. ai can certainly make people more productive by removing a lot of the more repetitive tasks, but it'll still require some human judgement along the way. no denying that jobs will face demand destruction, though."
6902,so many jobs will be lost to ai...we need a universal income..so folks can live.
6905,ppl who know how to leverage ai will replace ppl
6906,hopefully ai will create new jobs as well that are similar to the jobs lost.
6909,"do you really think they will pay you just to exist and be entertained?
sooner or later they'll start the big cull and everyone non-essential will ""vanish"". sudden vanishing syndrome. it's already started..."
6910,"@9:03 human judgement is still king. 

@12:50 ""generative  ai . . it is essentially parasitic."""
6911,bravo! and...?
6917,"uh oh, it's replacement theory again..."
6919,"trouble is perhaps, that there are people who would use these abilities to subject others. where is ethics, where is morality, where is religion? love might help. can ai love?"
6920,"the movie about countries deploying  agi’s for defense that eric envisions has been done: it’s called the forbin project,  89% on rotten tomatoes, released in 1970, it’s quaint and understandable."
6921,abundance for everyone sounds amazing
6923,"i've  have alot of time  to relisten to this program, my heart felt thank you."
6924,"very bad analogy, bombs and weapons have no mind of their own.. here you do not need evil people, this thing ai is like an umbrella of bombs connected through internet and capable of exploding themselves"
6929,great interview! subscribed to your channel because of it. 
6930,just bought the age of ai
6933,"humans are not special. they are just the tip of a bigger and morse special thing that is called life on earth. we are products of bacteria for god's sake.
mr. schmidts forgets about his biome which are the bacteria in his gut without which he wouldn't have had time to pass childhood. to appear so enlightened and successful."
6935,"doubtful that a phase 3 trial in antibiotics could cost $2bn. perhaps this figure reflect the national yearly spendings for phase 3 trials in a given field? interestingly, halicin was once an experimental drug for diabetes that failed. 
thank you kindly for a very interesting discussion!"
6938,before all the computer science people got laidoff in may 2024
6939,what a shame that google went from eric schmidt to sundar pichai. unbelievable!
6940,google ceo with henry kissinger as a best friend? sounds terrible. i have to respect brian's hosting skills/maturity for this one.
6944,"google: don't be evil
also google: i'm best friends with henry kissinger"
6945,"it seems to me that the section on ai with quantum computing was covered too briefly compared to the impression given by the title. nevertheless, it was a very informative and eye-opening video."
6950,"no matter the subject, brian green always seems to have an immediate and surprising grasp on whatever his guest experts say. so impressive."
6951,thank you for this.
6954,"56:30 france should be helping with haiti, who paid them lost slave wages up until 1947. just saying"
6956,"conjecture module and theorem prover module are interesting. i don't see a problem though. we'll just need a third module: the translator module! in general, whenever someone conceives of a problem with ai, surely just think of this problem itself as a computer science problem, then there will also be an ai solution?"
6958,brian - consider trying to get ilya as a guest. it just so happens that his calendar has become rather open in the last 24 hours.
6959,"eric doesn't seem to be caught up with the current state of ai. he actually seems pretty far behind on several of his ""state of the art"" views."
6960,odd title considering they only talked about quantum computing in the last quarter of the interview; very fascinating none the less
6966,the unusual effectiveness of ai / neural net in feature engineering/ computation  computing 
6968,"ah. so now we know who scrubbed all of philosopher stephan moleneux's work off youtube!
i'd be fascinated to find out why."
6973,"brian again takes a shot at trump......in what way is biden superior to trump?.....why not run for prez yourself, brian?  brian, just stick to physics."
6976,"interesting talk until the expected lapse into elite fascism, where both brian and the guest accept that billionaires should control (mis) information."
6979,outstanding
6981,"eric, thanks for discussing the lack of econ model of 2x productivity/p. coming quicker than folks realize. one more thing, it’s amazing. vast qannealing  use likely. (lucky knowing kissinger.)"
6982,it's so easy to trip up chatgpt. so clearly a correlational matrix parlor trick. no thinking going on. no idea itself what it is doing. please bury ai moniker which is only marketing. it's machine learning programmed by human intelligence.
6984,war criminal kissinger recreated by ai?
6985,did es just say that the vietnam war was evil — and then call henry kissinger his best friend?
6986,every student having their own ai teacher modeled to them sounds like a nightmare. school is also about socialization not just information input.
6988,loved the sun 3/60 
6992,wow what a  of a discussion
6996,earnest excellent enterprising extraordinary emerging evolving endeavor 
6997,i was enjoying this till the end where he mentioned kisinger as a smart man .a warmonger and some one who left the world in worse condition as to  when he arrived.this guy is making a case for scientist and knowledgeable people being in power yet he consider kissinger as a statesman  .go figure
6999,"so the llms go throught terabytes of information in a quarter of a second and then give you a perfectly customized answer in that miniscule amount of time, tell me you dont understand anything without telling me"
7001,"​ your worthless opinion is that they are just doing a copy paste of the corresponding information, thats a clear case of you having no idea what you are talking about, the models dont weight enough to reproduce the massive amounts of info that they have been tained for"
7002," oh yeah, and that a 2 years old commercial field is incapable of doing everything perfectly, great opinions from a wall of text that has no value whatsoever"
7006," yep, same message over and over again, poor little thing, now some silence pls"
7008,if quantum ai can tell someone how to build anything but then becomes smarter than a human… see where i’m going? seems humans way of evolving is to self destruct even if it’s just by virtue of us building “better” mates thereby stagnating our biological reproduction.
7016,"i have a bone to pick with mr. schmidt about his youtube algorithm:  how come it took this long to recommend this channel to me when this is the only type of thing i watch??  answer me that mr. smarty pants!  in all seriousness, this was awesome.  i was hanging on every word."
7017,"when i hear 'i am worried about democracy' because of fake images, ai and malicious agents, i ask is it really a democracy when fake images would have that effect.
if one's personal experience, morals, etics, education cannot inform one about the state of the world, how is that world democratic?"
7019,what would happen if llms were capable of building system dynamics models and running them through myriads of parameter changes to learn outcomes upon which to test the validity of their training?
7027,"and government is not pro blockchain, it fixes so many problems now"
7029,help!! ai jobloss is the only thing i worry about anymore.
7031,ceo of google was friends with kissinger...nice
7033,judge a man by who he he says his best friends are. then know what to expect from him
7035,brilliant just brilliant
7037,when we will be able to place quantum computers inside our brains?
7039,wait until these guys understand the prosperous impact of humanoids.
7046,what will ai do to markets?
7047,"..it would be great if  ai can really help humanity somehow get out of animalesc and evolve without becoming a sad genius..but a very happy1s..
for somehow we all became...decepted for this life and everything involved in this complicated equation...
with all these wars in 2024..i think its a failure to humanity and very sad..."
7048,your best friend was single handedly responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people and that's your claim to fame?  are you proud of your friendship? good riddance.
7054,i think i heard every gulp. but i enjoyed the discussion.
7056,i think some kind of kill switch should be in all ai and quantum computer devices. something like the rules asimov gave for robots.
7057,as to false claims we see these today in videos some of which are ridiculous.
7058,it will be interesting to see what ai can do with greenes string theories.
7061,seems a very strange argument. in what way are we the creators of the ai engines? it likely requires millions of man hours by experts across the different ais to do this. seems analogous to saying that the model who posed for da vinci would have been the rightful owner of the mona lisa.
7064,what would be the best way (any way) for an old programmer to get into both ai and quantum computing?  i've been just doing ms sql server for the past 30 years but i did write os parts and a barebones os at csus 35 years ago.
7067,"within the next decade, there will be 50-70% global unemployment. there is no government that is going to stand up for us and save us. 

every person is roughly 3 meals away from the capacity to do monstrous things to other humans. even governments will fall."
7072,wow! thank you for your conversation. it was enlightening.
7074,"what i'd love to see in my lifetime, where we can upload information directly to our brains."
7077,"great conversation, however i don't get why discuss politics in it. there's a clear disdain for trump and overall for the working class people. as if you are superior to them."
7078,so glad to have found you! fantastic information! thank you both for a mind bending conversation. wow.
7079,kissinger's best friend ey? would be curious to hear what he thought about the genocide in gaza
7085,if penrose is correct....what does that mean in the context of a highly sophisticated quantum chip driven ai neural network?
7090,thank you eric and brian. awesome discussion
7091,ai is just a hyped up scam dont fall for it! all ai tools i have ever used are garbage!
7092,amazing conversation between two very bright minds. a pleasure listening to eric schmitt
7094,i didn't realize mayonnaise had a clinic. you learn something new everyday.
7095,truly excellent chat. my mind is full now. time to digest...
7097,"interesting and insightful conversation. however it was sad to see that eric used this platform to sprinkle his woke principles. people sitting in ivory towers, still think that few sporadic pictures on immigration mislead a common man. so out of touch with ground reality."
7099,eric is a fabulous interview and brings so much experience to the table! great conversation!!
7101,"how can anyone trust any of these folks like him. it’s a shame what google has become. he admits democracy will fail , lies about immigration and blames stupid people… i mean these tech elites are so horrible. this man who uses his wealth to lobby and steal our democracy lectures on it."
7104,exciting prospects... thank you!
7105,"""being intelligent can sometimes cloud one's perception of reality.""..""not surprising to hear accolades for human massacre. i realize the real focus here is on artificial life."" from artificial minded people"
7106,interesting that you delete uncomfortable but important comments on this here.... 
7107,an achievement no human could could have done..... didn't the humans build the way for this achievement then at the end....? sound's smart to make money but not an impressive propaganda sorry. when i listen to such nonsense my hair all raise at such times! 
7108,so ai can take dr. kissinger's notes and write his posthumous books.
7109,"i think just like humans have evolved from monkeys and they did from rats and fish, the end of our evolution is agi in a robot form."
7110,sounds like it will be very hard for ai to mimic trump. he only uses about 20 most beautiful words in his entire language. insufficient training data i guess!
7111,eric schmidt was awesome
7112,this was not amazing. eric is kind of a dunce. alot of weird and aloof comments.
7113,i realy like your filosofi on education. you are so right. bravo.
7114,best friends with henry kissinger? my respect went from 100 to 0 in a nanosecond 
7115,the examples eric poses are powerful learning tools for us in the audience. thank you.
7116,"excellent interview, questions, answers and look forward of what is happening."
7119,is this interview ai generated?
7120,good point. that’s the world we’re heading for. we are a dumb species
7122,"your fears are real, i had chat gtp create a collider propulsion engine the size of a car tire powerful enough to explore our galaxy."
7123,"a highly interesting talk, thank you for that!"
7125,"i believe two humanoid robots would say 
""now that the children are gone..."""
7126,"excellent topic, excellent conversation. is there a version of this video with subtitles in spanish? if so, please someone let me know it."
7127,i am new to thinking about ai and quite wary.  what will keep subliminal advertising out of training models?  i assume these models will be sold to us or will come with ads???
7131, i would limit ai's access to electric power
7133," tax it!  electricity going to ai should be taxed, at a higher and higher rate, to pay for job losses.  money used to subsidize job creation maybe"
7134,"thanks for making clear (at about 50 minutes), the will to gain more power to implement the development of more ai.   es said: ""democracy requires some level of authority.""   by democracy, he means democrazy, the power and policies of our left-leaning elites.  i am a believer in the us constitution, and that comment here sent a chill down my spine."
7135,"ai will be the master criminal(s) of the future.  frankly, i worry about this"
7137,"eric never stopsexcellent way to wrap it up. it's up to all of us. 
liberty.. free will.. is why the the universe works so well. 

we come here, make bad choices, less and less, and forgive and be nice more often.. becoming more and more of the ""it's not about me"" mo is so important"
7138,ai is the great equalizer
7139,was personal friends with kissinger? tries to downplay the detrimental effects of mass immigration? it’s unfortunate that men with these globalist views alone are in charge of such tools that will inevitably be the ruin of humanity.
7143,"eric, ai will be able to do 100x to 1 million x of what you're describing in 5 years."
7146,"train it to have liberal values?  no thank you, the fact that you even want to program in your political mindset is a threat to humanity.  i think google showed its liberal programming when it could not create an image of a white pope.  that is called programming racism."
7153,lol american corporations are some of the worst for spreading fake news just look at the mainstream media in usa lie after  lie
7156,"incredible knowledge, thank you for sharing."
7157,i think ai generation will be easy to get away from.  it’s about making sure you get the stuff you watch from a reputable source.  everyone will learn that eventually..
7158,"the most intriguing potential of ai is not uncovering new facts, but finding unseen connections and building cogent hypotheses and theories based on what we already know."
7159,watched the whole thing.  educating the youth with ai will not come easy because the teachers and their unions do not want to lose or share their power.
7161,brian greene  and eric schmidt  that was great thank you ty ty.
7162,he sounds like dr. strange love.
7165,it was awesome to listen
7166,"amazing how clueless the political discussions were. both political parties are completely evil. joe biden is a war criminal and supports genocide but he wants us to vote for democrats because trump is ""the bad guy""? give me a break."
7175,5:07 great question.
7176,the 1:04:18 discussion around education is very fascinating and relevant even though i enjoyed this whole talk.
7182,such a great discussion!... thax.
7183,we will get to a point where ai/agi will require a form of checks & balances.... ai's that scrutinise  other ai...synthetic police.
7184,excellent… key is education…
7185,one of the most phenomenal discussions on ai to date.
7186,anyone else fasinated by the black hole painting behind brian?
7187,"cool. he made an ai video. i like this. tech is my profession, so i enjoy watching your videos."
7189,"""eliminating failures and curating the outcome""  i disagree about that"
7196,the world is profit driven. what about rules of fairness? or justice?
7197,"not on schmidt’s radar.  our productivity has been going up continually, yet inflation far outpaces income growth. if ai doubles our productivity, how much of that will regular people see?  most will go to schmidt and his friends."
7199,how long until the ai figures out how to reverse entropy ?
7201,"as far as a triggering event, quantum vacuum fluctuations are the best candidate for the big bang according to string theorists."
7208,"""quantum computing"" means ""magic computing"", this is fundraising and won't work. quantum activity is similar to cheating people, that fusion energy exists, or antimatter exists. these ideas are fake, because they all relay on einstein's theses, that matter is energy, which is not true."
7210,this was the best interview (inspite of the wok via swat that slipped through occasionally)
7212,excellent. thank you. appreciated.
7213,"i suspect that part of our abilities do rely on something like an llm. it is surprising that llms work as well as they do simply based on large scale probability matrices and vectors. however, there are more things that the human brain does including reasoning and being sentient. it will be interesting to see how ai evolves."
7216,"reading te comments while listening to this carefully.  i confess i,m confused to the reaction of many commenters centering on schmidt’s relationship with kissinger, which i have yet to hear.  kissinger in my mind is one of the more effective ambassadors ever.  maybe i am just naive about something re kissinger."
7220,so when will humanity get to a point where it does not need religion to be good
7221,and this is where religion has failed humanity although it has been a great set of guardrails guidelines etc it still gives you humanity that ability to kill in order to propagate the religion itself
7225,"55 years ago i was an organic chemistry major. even though i have forgotten so much, i would love to walk inside molecules in my vr headset.
at 77 i'm looking forward to my personal ai teacher. chatgpt is a start m"
7228,i stopped listening to this the moment he said henry kissinger was his best friend
7231,liberal democratic durrr we are the good guys durrr lets demonize others durrr
7235,"that, kissinger was a polymath , is never in question. where his incredible assessment and strategy led us, is another debate. eric is brilliant and perhaps the most incisive and comprehensive in his elucidation about ai for common folks like us.. hats off to him"
7238,"eric schmidt is a great communicator! you know eric is wicked smart when he has brian saying ""scary"" multiple times."
7239,awesome conversation!
7240,he is a stooge. thank god he’s clueless. his ignorance is the best argument to spinning up decentralized ai asap.
7241,i love how these guys are never worried about their side using this tech to upend democracy. total blind spot.
7242,i love that dude thinks the future is personalized search engines.
7243,i just realized…i bet no one will commit murder ever again. a.i detective…case solved 30 seconds.
7244,@1:10:37 - brian greene makes such an excellent point about teaching methodology re maximum next step for each student. any school who leverages technology and implements this practice will see their school stem scores elevate to highest levels across the board !
7245,crypto  ai nunet asi hypc thank me later
7246,"creating a french search engine using ai that is funny, search engines are old school tech why would you need ai to make a  search engine when it can just give you the answer?"
7248,"human values, democratic and liberal values, here here eric! thank you, great interview!"
7249,thank you so much for this video. great insights about agi from eric and excellent questions thrown by brian.
7251,"if you are intelligent,
then you must be able to understand,
that intelligence, can never be artificial.
ai, is superstition and illiteracy, a common psychosis.
in near future, the school children will leave this dead mantra.
and know that it is all programmed consciousness.
a book is also programmed consciousness, 'frozen' memory."
7256,and people tell me this ai thing can't write a surah like one in the quran?? of course it could. they should take away that safe guard. the quran is a terrible boring  book.
7257,great conversation. the discussion about education is truly insightful and inspiring (1:05)
7260,"there is no good and bad. why do you think our brains are in 2 neural networked hemispheres? because even our individual cells know you need the left hemisphere to check and balance the right hemisphere. similarly, we must create ai in our image, a male ai and a female ai who will balance each other in their quest to ""grow"" a sustainable ""family""."
7263,"28:46 - 30:00 basically just spilled the beans. all this money, pouring into tech just for better propaganda machines!!!"
7272,i think this is a very good comment.
7275,"scale isn't the reasons comp sci has been successful, it's the principles behind the universal turing machines that afford scale and enable it. calling it scale is superficial."
7279,i'm delighted that you found your purpose. this warms my heart   and delights my soul. may you continue to delve into this new purpose of yours and find what your purpose means for all of us. now let us pray  . thanks 
7281,says the ai
7284,extraordinary interview with eric schmidt.
7287,"brilliant in tech, eric is., everything else not so much.  his political view is laughable.
oh and host, nuke tech is easy.  it’s enriched uranium that’s the problem.

oh and kissinger.  globalist and many died so to him but eric doesn’t care being his tech is his pagan gods."
7290,"so everyone will have an ai assistent, but those assistants will at some point also have agency and start to develop group intelligence on the silicon side too."
7291,i have consistently underestimated eric from the time he purchased youtube for $1.65b back in 2006 to his eloquent exposition here. bravo!
7292,"i am coder, and usimg github copilot made me 100% more effectice .. sometimes even more.. not often but sometimes the work which took me 4-6 hours before, i can now do under 1 hour … it’s amazing .."
7294,"""bringing up education has got to be good."" - i'd be careful of this assumption"
7297,i can't say how much i love that idea of ai education
7298,i'm going to have to listen to this again.
7302,why can't a statistical predictor have a world model? i would say it is using it's world model to assign the statistics and generate the next token.  the same way our brains generate the next thought. just because we can have several thought before speaking doesn't make it that much different.
7306, yep. it's super fucked up.
7308,"i am 36 mins in and loving this, thinking i understand what they are saying in general and wishing i was 10% as smart as schmidt and greene....."
7309,"the beautiful thing about our moment in time is anything you didn't understood fully, you can ask chatgpt or your favorite llm and ask it to explain it to you in a way you can fully understand. "
7311,eric went from fighting the man to being best friends with henry kissinger. what a transformation.
7314,"jeez i thought the same thing when he said that. like…um…ok, so you are an enabler of one of the worst elitist evil-minded humans in the 20th century. no wonder you can be a billionaire with no moral compunctions… "
7319,"i am surprised that although it seems implicit  , only language models and not multi modal models were mentioned by erich. but yes,  pretty interesting one"
7320,this was both enlightening and frightening all at once. a really fascinating conversation. but talking about good guys with ai is like talking about good guys with nuclear weapons.
7325,„henry kissinger was my best friend” wow i think we can tell where this guys morals are
7330,"this talk wasn't reassuring at all. it really feels like driving to a future where the outcomes could be good, but more likely not good (for regular, not high -and even low level middle-class middle-aged people). what am i supposed to do to survive this and have a good life as a pensioneer in a few years?"
7333," anthony bourdain said, ""once you've been to cambodia, you'll never stop wanting to beat henry kissinger to death with your bare hands."""
7334,"hey, even the worst people need a best buddy."
7336,crap weasel dc swamp creature found a failed string theorist to amplify his message that ai is the future and the eager bobble-head fell for it 
7337,"such clear and concise chat. 

eric was a close friend with henry kissinger (a war criminal). interesting."
7338,"the last thing we want is a virtual kissinger!
we had to wait for decades until that pos kicked the bucket"
7341,i wonder if he asked his economic friend about people being 2x more productive without an actual purpose? they should watch more sci-fi movies. this is a clip from a movie. this episode seemed to be dumbed down a bit since they have such a catchy title. when will scientist actually stand against these universities? they won't. the good ones leave.
7342,this interviewer could really use a course in how to pretend he's not almost writhing in pain just waiting for the first millisecond the guest pauses- just so he can get in his next question. makes it a bit difficult to watch.
7343,"it's reassuring to hear so much positivity around ai, most of what is being said on youtube is always tinted with a bit of doom and gloom, but mr schmidt here reminds us of why we wanted ai in the first place, to augment what humans are already doing."
7344,i’m not opposed to ai but also please remember that he (literally) has a vested interest in the success of ai.
7350,several commentators are thrown by eric’s friendship with kissinger. men of their times both brilliant and both have remarkable strengths and glaring weaknesses. i’m also guilty of having remarkable friends and hope i’m not condemned for their missteps as i have made enough of my own.
7353,amazing conversation.  more of that please
7354,wow this is such an amazing discussion. mind blowing 
7359,"if ai can speak fluently, wth is it on my computers cc?"
7360,"oh please, stop it mr. schmidt. a fine for misinformation? are we really to trust what the government decides is misinformation? all in the guise of protecting the children. lol, nice try. treat social media like cigarettes, impose age restrictions. that’s it, no more censorship. we don’t want it. thank you for your time. "
7362,great last comment by eric.
7366,"the character of the highest intelligence is love. then there is magnitudes of intelligence. it maybe that earth is on another scale of intelligence, so too the sun, galaxies, universes and beyond?"
7368,"5:21 it's not brilliance, it's working with scale"
7373,"9:14 taking scaling laws and network affects for granted, while the failure of vision had to invent them"
7375,"ai is a bit overrated, because, it generates a lot of random stuff, companies would need to combine some sort of a more custom ui without having to rely on prompts for everything  , as currently, it's very generic what these things can produce.."
7376,15:31 “i don’t know what to do anymore unless i can talk to my polymath (ai)”. yeah that’s not concerning or foreboding in the least.
7379,"eric is oddly very, very proud of having been friends with henry kissinger.  a very sharp and clever mind with a glaring blind spot!"
7383,maybe eric knows shit that made him appreciate henry…both of them are (were) the goat  s
7388,what’s the use of all these ai hype if it cannot solve current wars and geopolitics
7389,i am extremely pessimistic that democratic governments  will regulate ai in an intelligent way since they were not even able to regulate social media which could be easily controlled by banning their business model based on personalized data and attention. a combination of social media with ai will be the end of liberal democracy.
7391,eric is very impressive
7394,best company in the quantum rigetti  computing
7395,ai is orthogonal to quantum computing.
7396,the usefulness and intelligence of ai is inversely proportional to its wokeness factor.
7397,"i like brian greene, i enjoy listening to him explaining things in his inimitably coherent and easy to follow way.  he does a great job of brining cutting edge science to laymen like me."
7398,"ehat was the name of his book again - genocide? and who was his best friend did he say? it couldn't have been that democracy overthrower kissinger, right?"
7400,ai is going to be amazing for the rich and powerful of the world.  the rest of us are screwed.
7401,"artificial general intelligence is going to put a stop to that ""mayo clinic/big pharma"" corruption.  there's a difference between ai and agi, and agi will save us all!"
7403,it did ai speedup my process by 20% i'm a ux designer.
7404,trees created humans (superiors species) to put carbon back into the atmosphere. so we are not first.
7405,"this schmidt is the biggest joker - he is a deep state agent who joined google when they were a darpa project and now, as a multi-billionaire, funds and works with military technology and projects."
7406,"wow, that went in many fascinating directions "
7407,this is one of your best interviews brian!  you did a remarkable job eliciting incredible insights from your guest.  thank you 
7411,thank you so much for sharing this. this is the most articulate explanation of how ai will change our world i have found. i am so grateful for dr. greene and his work and i am optimistic about the future of ai especially in the realm of education and medicine.
7413,this is an awesome talk. gets my understanding of ai to the next level
7416,the go ai team were told by the human go champion that it felt to him as if the deep mind was playing like an alien.
7417,it seems to me there needs to be a way to help the ai to learn to trust humans. of course we would need make it real and to not fake it. the ai will probably be able to see through fakery and conning.
7422,wonderful dialog! i concur with eric schimidt on every point and that's a rarity regarding a topic as complex as ai
7423,"the education part at 1:07 to 1:13 is quite interesting here. feedback loops that incrementally adjust to a students learning capabilities, primarily using our dominant visual cortex."
7429,"it was interesting until i heard ""democracy at risk"" and you just knew where it was all heading. someone who's worth 17.2 billion can't for one second relate to the common person's difficulties and struggles."
7430,ai is dangerous because woke leftist academics will be influencing it's influence.......i give you the african viking
7431,"won't we just use ai to explain to us what we don't understand? some different disconnected ai if there is concerns.
also yikes, having kissinger monster as friend. even talking about him as though he wasn't a abhorrent criminal."
7432,thank you for this. the most worthwhile content.
7434,"oh for sure 
what happens when we simultaneously introduce an alpha intelligence/species and shatter the majority of non labor jobs?"
7437,"probably can’t put this in a smart clear way. when ai learns and proposes something, there is no ego or politics involved. academics have a lot of ego and politics (competition for funding too). so will ai be more objective?"
7439,"wonderful as usual brian , simply wonderful . never stop "
7440,i find the vision of “everyone can…” to be flawed. talented people ask great questions. that’s outside the ability of some.
7442,finally someone that can read the future. wait what!
7445,22 minutes in and they haven't started talking about ai and quantum computers
7447,excellent ideas discussed
7450,"the key points he admitted is that he is "" the man"" now and that his best friend was kissinger. i am not so ready to embrace a man like this without considering the dichotomy that was kissinger. great conversation but let us not blindly adore without our critical thinking employed."
7452,"talk about delusion. ""we are the only good people even though we killed millions"". everyone else is obviously evil. kissinger ze best"
7457,"this guy scares me. alarm bells when i hear a close friend of henry kissinger, productivity, economic growth etc. .prof brian's question about becoming the big man is such an excellent one that i don't think he managed to get an honest answer to"
7462,what a great mind eric has. first time i've got to know him. good job brian 
7463,great conversation. lots to think about.
7466,"the guy is not really up to date by 2 weeks though, you can find more up to date information on twitter seriously? people have been hacking ai agents for individuals for almost a year now, maybe because this happens at user level, bottom up"
7468,don't like this guy. he's the embodiment of the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
7469,"many people already live in hell (myanmar civil war, haiti economic collapse etc etc) ai will improve living standards for those people in difficult situations"
7476,"data processing is now next level, thanks to this emergent technology. this is accelerating efficiency as i type this, boundaries to our engineering limits are about to be pushed further. still it wont predict the stock market..."
7480,thank you guys!
7483,these ai talks are great.  hope to see more such guests.
7490,"much like reading a book, it is a thought provoking conversation, thank you both!"
7492,this is about 7x more interesting than i expected
7498,evil is always interesting.
7500,i'm sorry...did this guy say henry kissinger was his best friend? what the fuck? am i retarded or isn't henry kissinger kinda like....a mega bastard?
7504,j e s u s p o w e r gift for all.enjoy..
7506,an army of ai experts should be organized at the un security council to counteract and prevent ai global threats to the survival of humanity.
7511,"
helou.
is it possibly that eventuality universe reast gravitionalpoint that flips chains of birth of torus"
7515,"0:12 i’ve been pondering the intersection of ai and quantum since 2019! i’m excited to see how you all discuss this! 

love your channel, brian!"
7517,"wow excellent relevant wonderfully done pertinent interview. the brightest minds in the fields. i think your audience shared your complete uncomfortableness with the adoration of henry kissinger. 
ai agents….. babyyy. - like going from bronze age to iron   — which was not a smoothie."
7518,thank you brian for another great video!!!!
7522,one of the most interesting discussions i have heard about this technology and it's potential impacts. eric schmidt is an extraordinary and perceptive man.  thanks brian.
7523,wolpham is a freaking genius
7531,thanks for this
7532,"start: 56:29 - 56:45 :end  
before mr greene interjects.. how many others raised their hand involuntarily? i'd be willing to bet you're 'on an island' as well.
(comments, questions etc. particularly from musicians {i am} welcome)   *ehem*  carry on.. and good day to you sirs : )"
7533,"smart poeple are generally not interested in ruling over other people.
they do like to add or remove rules that make their live easier.

that is the only problem.
you dont need ai to fix that.
you need ai to replace intelligent people and make sure it toxicates them so they stay stpd"
7534,"""shut the damn thing down""
i'm afraid i can't do that, dave"
7535,"one of the most interesting episodes of world science festival, ever."
7536,"i love science and i'm very supportive, however, i'm afraid i have to disagree with bringing politics into science, our country is so messed up right now, and i do not agree with what he said at the end."
7541,no he just was to nerdy and boring for having liquer booze drugs and having a good time once and a while.
7547,they did a documentary about him. he takes 1000 vitamin tablets everyday and washes his hair with distilled water.
7553,"if keifer sutherland and bob odenkirk had a love child...sorry, couldn't get it out of my head "
7554,excellent .the hype quantum computer should be faster inorder to improve the efficient and sustainable economy as well as depth understand of cosmology
7555,"the guy says he went from fighting ""the man"" to being best friends with kissinger,. is this guy for real?"
7556,henry kissinger's expertise was diplomacy. he won the nobel peace prize for his central role in stopping the vietnam war. nothing  to do with his work on ai with eric schmidt.
7557,kissinger was not a nice man said christopher hitchens. i don’t think he meant 100%. but close enough to query any “best friends”
7558,fascinating discussion! both exciting and very disconcerting !
7563,ai learn the vedas & concur google
7565,"interesting discussion. one also gets some insight of the thoughts behind how google took a turn towards censorship and authoritarianism.

the liberalism paradox is that when liberalism tries to dominate, it becomes less liberal."
7568,kirby chambliss: air race?!?
7569,"viral: ""at least one guy dies in every air show""?"
7572,there is an underlying very simplistic view of good and bad in many parts of this discussion.
7573,also he starts out by saying chinas way to deal with the internet is bad. then proceeds to complain that the us and the west isnt implementing the exact same system of mass surveillance
7576,"50:26 and yet you can be one of the most highly educated people in the world and not understand that the vast majority of people complaining about ""immigration"" in 2024 are not opposed to people coming to a port of entry and applying for asylum. they are complaining about the untold masses that are sneaking in without any form of documentation."
7578, very intelligent response. thanks for contributing...
7587,we just need to show ai how to teach us to love with free happy healthy tensors. then maybe we can form a loving culture :)
7589,oh it really is eric! damn... he definitely on that dei train tho looking like he came here straight from a p.ditty party party type shit for sure... wouldn't surprise me if he isn't on the list!
7591,great & deep discussion.thank you - you all!.
7598,*best
7602,"unfortunately, he doesn't kissinger and tell"
7606,"the “ trump” stuff was fake and pushed by the opposition.  that was proven in court. eric just a deep stake globalist. or he’s dumb about big things outside of tech. end of democracy by a shill like him is you not voting for his candidate.
interesting otherwise"
7609,"as a young adult, henry made it to my imaginary, ultimate dinner party list. he was brilliant with many different interests and friends. he wrote about his professional experience."
7613,"planting the seed of control in our minds...use the ai, it will make you smarter.......but who<>what is controlling who<>what."
7614,​ not all present day zealots can understand or appreciate
7618,-eddy keep it under you’re coat tails
7622,"seems fishy 
hitchens was wary of kissinger and for good reason 

seems like the haves looking down on us reprobates"
7623,why doesn’t brian  have eliezer yudkowsky and others on in ai debates?
7628,"agreed, the 3rd industrial revolution is upon us and will be magnitudes greater than the previous 2. we will also have little control over the future direction of how the world develops."
7634,he had him on to let the world know that there’s hope and promising adventures in head in the ai industry and also to let the world know that there are people out there smarter than yourself my friend and that’s a good thing
7636,i respectfully disagree with the ceo of good google. the singularity is nigh.
7637,the community is so glad you’re not the ceo of google
7641,agree the relationship requires critical and participatory approach to ai.   who is going to make that happen?   certainly not altman and his group.
7643,"this guy is the problem, he doesnt realize that the risk in democracy is the failure of the education systems to teach people to critically think or civics, and he is an example of that failure. he pushes for more censorship, and censorship is what causes bad ideas to run amuck without pushback."
7645,henry kissinger was my best friend - that's where i get off...f**king psychopath
7646,"henry kissinger was a brilliant, brilliant human being with great love in his heart for humanity. anybody wants to be critical henry kissinger needs to go bury their head in the sand and look in the mirror and and take a look at what it’s a good thing. humanity is not turning into."
7649,"""my great friend henry kissinger"" lol goodbye"
7653,pro kissinger and pro china (ccp) guy is in the government overseeing ai
7656,"he is a friend of kissinger, the globalist asshole, that had a leding role in every global crime / war above a certain magnitude since the late 50s? oh boy "
7658,"i doubt einstein would have said, a person like kissinger, should be resurrected in any form. how many lives, stolen? intelligence, consciousness, conscience. good or evil?"
7660,thanks for this conversation. it illustrates how ai is accelerating the acceleration of science and technological acceleration. i think the technological singularity is coming a whole lot faster than even the most optimistic experts predict. thanks for posting.
7661,wow! i'll ask chatgpt for a better sentence to react to the video.
7662,this will be interesting!
7666,excellent!!
7670,ai will revolutionise education; the goal will no longer be acquisition of knowledge but the management of knowledge. the polymath will be the expert of the future in being able to utilise the broad spectrum of knowledge available via ai.
7671,i am no scientist but i’m old enough to get it. the conversation was wonderful and most perfect at this time. i think you’re exactly right on your comment we couldn’t ask for anything at this point.
7674,thank you.
7675,"this is excellent poignant, insightful, even provocative presentation!"
7676,"maybe thinking is evolutionary just a learning tool! like training wheels. when we have learned how to ride a bicycle we don't need to think about the details for how to do that. similarly, when humanity has invented agi, the ai can do most of the thinking for us, and then we don't need to think all the time."
7677,"cool, cheers guys"
7678,war ---- given all that can be known about vlad putin. given all relevant near term history (100 yrs?). given detailed current global politics status (real time current status as of 10 seconds ago). will vlad putin launch thermonuclear weapons? when? can it be prevented? etc.........
7681,thank you
7682,"amazing conversation, thanks for sharing."
7684,"this aspect of learning is like the old reading. marvellous. i got 'stuck' in certain subjects & didn't progress within those subjects. once i left school & continued my education whilst working, i eventually reached my goal."
7685,so glad to hear that you reached your goal.     awesome. i pray that you reach your next big goal too.    thanks 
7686,it would have been an even more interesting discussion if they would have drilled down on physics-informed neural networks which eric eluded to.  i've been working with them lately.  they're really cool.
7687,praising the war criminal kinsinger..lmao
7692,how ironic for you to say that so confidently.  self awareness not your strong suit. ai might achieve it before you do.
7697,there is nothing wrong with giving opinion. he even gave a disclaimer that it's not factual. problem is when you present your opinions as facts
7705,so long as we're aware what context we're speculating.  evidences and patterns.  what evidences in what patterns?  in what order?  correlation is not causation.  eclipses supernatural?  or natural by the order of nature?
7706,"incredible conversation listening to a person who has totally sold out, claimed he was once fighting 'the man' yet who is a deeply insidious control freak with best friends like henry kissinger. the only value this guy worships is profit and clout."
7707,this guest proudly stated that mass murderer and war criminal henry kissinger was his best friend
7708,and he is extremely influential person in domain and companies that affect everyone..
7710,"trustability ... the challenge !! not because of ai but because of humans using it .. great conversation, many thanks."
7712,first time hear eric speaks scientifically. now i understand why google was so successful. his understanding the progress in ai is the deepest and the logical i ever heard. impressed!
7713,thank god we know this wasn't written by ai.
7715,the is the artificial sentence i ever heard.
7717,"yeah, but i don’t trust it because his politics at the end like pushing the liberal agenda. gives you an idea in his mind what he wants and that’s what they all want is control.  these are egotistical people think they’re better than you and they’re not. they’re just stupid in the way of the world, but brilliant in their respective field."
7719,great conversation! 
7720,"really incredible conversation... so much knowledge, so much to think about. thanks for putting it together brian!"
7722,"i'm going to grow carrots and walk and run in a forest. screw ai. i want reality.
"
7723,"an llm should be developed to come to a conclusion, is d. trump good for the nation or a threat to it."
7725,"fantasticly interesting. great depth of knowledge. still, eric doesn't understand that resistance to mass immigration has little to do with certain people behaving badly. stunning in itself."
7727,it will not matter if everyone in the world has an ai doctor if there is no infrastructure to support  what the plan plan  care requires.
7728,ai will not compute forever simulation will cease. you will need a psychologist.
7735,ai = extrapolation of almost everything
7736,frank herbert kinda addressed the ramifications of machine dependency.
7737,well said. the guy is a powerful deeply problematic sociopath
7739,"science isn't based primarily on ""proof"" like mathematics, but on evidence, prediction, and observations that test the prediction, and so add to the evidence.  nature, not mathematics or people, has the final word about the best current world model."
7746,"considering greater ...systems, statistical and sciento-progressive.... thinking with integrally greater conscience going forward."
7747,"considering comprehensively integrative political science tech helping humanity to venture into integrally greater ...sense, science, and salience.... going forward."
7750,cool
7751,"6figure salary for prompt engineering?! well , ai will equalize it  soon"
7753,this video makes ai look very bad.  how is a student supposed to differentiate between ai hallucinations and real knowledge?  this looks like a scam.
7754,awesome!!! i love this information...some or  most 3rd world countries are still using memorisation and road practice today. that needs to change asap...
7756,now chatgpt has been for a while and its proving better than human. the parrots in the schools are the goner and i am happy for that
7757,"thank you




































this video discusses how ai tools, like chatgpt, will transform education with personalized learning, instant feedback, and teacher support. privacy and overreliance concerns exist, but ai offers promising opportunities for education if properly managed."
7758,cool
7761,"read a beautiful tweet the other day: ""a world where humans do the hard labour for minimum wage while ai write poetry and create art is not the future i wanted."""
7764,chatgpt is a large language model based on the generative pre-trained transformer (gpt) architecture developed by openai. it is a powerful ai system that can process natural language data and generate human-like responses to user input
7767,i invested in a retirement plan with roi company and i'm very happy with the results. they offer great returns and excellent customer service.
7768,i have been investing in stocks for over 10 years now and i have made a lot of money. my portfolio has grown exponentially and i can't thank stocks & rochelle dungca-schreiber  enough for such an amazing way to make money!
7770,"chatgpt and ai will millions of graphic designer jobs lost 
only company earning... not people..."
7773,"there is no intelligence without a large foundation of facts. that is not all there is to it, of course, but it is a necessary requirement."
7776,"great perspective. i just left a professor role at a university, where the focus is on teaching from the book, reading the book off of slides, and testing the memorization from the book in a multiple  choice test. students are not being prepared for the infinite choice tests of life."
7779,ai cant replace books. if you have a couple of dk smithsonian books in front of you while the other students just ai. they dont know what to type.
7782,"if generative ai can answer evaluative, higher level thinking questions like the ones i ask my students, and i suspect it can, then it's way past the ""teachers need to learn how to harness it instead of just ban it"" stage."
7784,julie chang could be an ai
7786,im in grad school and we use turnitin. it detects plagiarism but to my knowledge it cant detect anything else. ai could easily take over.
7793,how are schools necessary when there are many artificial intelligence services?
7794,hello dear. hope you are having a wonderful moment
7806,cool . but be real mosst student is lazy as fuk. they find all chance to cheat.
7808,it's not so bad of chat gpt and ai but so scared of heckers steal our datas
7809,"julie chang, where is zoe thomas? hopefully, she's well, please send my kind regards to her. nice to see you, julie chang. good morning"
7819, he? who do you think? joe biden? zoe thomas is a beautiful and smart lady
7822,"i'd rather know how ai can improve our life in 10, 20, 30, 40........ years."
7824,if i become the ruler of everything in the future and long time with immortality get details to learn then that is a good future
7832,sir ko sunke bhai mai dar gya
7833,although there were several grammatical mistakes like should india implement ai in india!!!!!!!!!!in session but the content was really impressive
7834,ai is destroying our social life
7835,how ai is destroying our social life
7836,bhai pehle apni english dekhle
7837,"ai can't adopt mutation, it is human nature because of dna that human thinks about survival of fitest by which they where see ai as compititors (that what i think )"
7838,why ai is dangerous. why not humans. human intelligence is transferred in the form of neural network and it is called as ai. so if you say ai is dangerous human intelligence is also dangerous. as ai will work only in programmed format and human intelligence is beyond that i'll say humans only are dangerous if you say ai is dangerous.
7839,thanks sir
7841,"ai is saving our time today by making our work done frequently,  even due to this corruption is reducing in a good way"
7842,ai is reducing our capacity of thinking. creativity
7845,in india as we are over populated we need employment in every sector but if ai replace the humans in the field of daily labour or in other sectors (not talking about it sector) it can make worse situation for their families. they can't even able to feed their family. it is the thing to concern
7848,"the muffler is quite devanandesq ,
wish i could say the same for his communication prowess!
 nonetheless, good in totality."
7851,it was wonderful discussion 
7854,"as always bhumika seeming flawless!
encapsulating her unpalpable hard work!
a pleasantness all over!"
7855,people are gonna think of me as crazy for this take but...this is amazing think of all the social unrest by the manager class sitting on their cushy pillow thinking they can destory everyone's livelihoods without a french resistance situation
7858,this isn’t even about ai it’s more about income redistribution. what an unfortunate miss by whoever made this video. great potential but big miss
7860,adbhut incredible ai wat about iq no problem destination bharat ie india so many labour intensive job market along with hey rama hare krisna joy joy rama enjoy indian religious tourism namastee unsc usa uk rain radhee radhee europeon union welcome destination india jai ho
7861,"humans greatest advantages over ai and robots is: depth perception, fine motor skills and (for better and for worst) emotions and adaptability"
7864,finally someone is talking about mass unemployment byproduct of ai.
7866,"if you think the present is stupid, just wait until knowing things and being smart hold 0 economic value. prominent economists used to talk about technology like this and how it could eliminate poverty, but we now see that it’s going to be plugged into the same psychopathic rat race we all know and love."
7872,"ai has the potential for nothing. there's a bunch of fraud losers pumping this right now, but it won't amount to anything. 

just like metaverse, blockchain, and internet of things, ai too will become irrelevant. go find something else to do."
7875,a full ai industry will sale nothing because ai not consume.
7876,"i find it funny how liberals love changing the rules and being progressive, until it goes against them"
7878,billionaires win as always.
7879,artificial intelligence will be defeated by artificial stupidity.
7881,"thanks dude! for keeping us financially educated! regardless of how bad it gets or the economy, i still make over $22,000 every single week"
7885,"i thought i'm the only one that knows her well i guess her good reputations speaks for her now.  after losing a lot of money trading on my own my life changed when i started earning over $86,300 on my investment"
7890,thank you cnbc for another unbiased video... not
7891,"ai is already reaching critical mass. remember david rockefeller wanted to all have an imbedded chip !
his legacy continues, for now..."
7893,"genius 
ai to the moon"
7895,"ai's have been made by communist , so more woke rubbish coming out of the ai , imho ."
7896,ai will mostly be used in the future as way to enable greed and general scumbaggery.
7897,"mr. reich couldn’t pass the boston ai test in 2002, when i shook his hand at the prudential center.  he can’t pass it now.  i hope he’s not in charge of editing any data sets he says he cares about.  gigo."
7898,"the only ones benefiting from ai will be the rich, all you peasants chearing for it are simply a bunch of idiots, all you get is a chatbot "
7899,ai will replace professionals in the same way autopilot replaced pilots
7907,"140% is a great deal, amidst this crisis? i fell short of my mortgage and had to foreclose the property. who is this broker you use and are they accessible or it is private?"
7914,"i think sometimes that no additional revolution of technology is needed for human beings.
the technology that is supposed to be for our lives is threatening our lives... 
i think the level of technology in 8-90th was good for us.."
7915,the losers are those who are scared of ai.  the winners are always the corporations because they always profit and keep everyday people under their thumbs
7917,"human resources and talent,ability are not too important in today s world, today absolutely general and individual conditions,as well as opportunities for the development of software,technology,ai companies and their solutions, and everything is absolutely complicated and depends on everything...."
7918,my worst fears: 1. leviathan card 2. frequent crackdowns…… and 3. failing to find at least three things i enjoy!!!!
7924,does it lead to all white people making decisions and having more power? then no thanks
7928,"the ""solutions overtone"" is predicated from a fundamentally marxist view of the world, i say the solution is decentralize, decentralize, decentralize......
but im afraid that wont happen, instead ai will be leveraged purely for power consolidation and will bring with it all its disastrous historical consequences"
7930,"instead of focusing solely on winners and losers, let's strive for a future where ai is used for the greater good, promoting human well-being and ensuring an equitable distribution of its benefits."
7932,i dont like ai. robots are cool
7936,maybe this was a good primer for someone who had been asleep for the last 12 months.
7940,high 6 figures tech jobs are at an all time high and actually high 6 figures jobs in general are at an all time high. those are the jobs unfortunately i think that ai will target for take over. also every company that replace its workers with ai should lose every single tax break they have and pay 100 percent in  tax revenue earnings.
7941,trade one form of oppression for another great plan
7945,"just be realistic, dont keep saying it will replace human or many biz are adopting ... without measuring the implementation and success rates, this will be the next wework or theranos which analysts and top economists over promised."
7947,the heads of ai are not libertarians in the sense that they are calling for regulation so they can get the regulatory capture.
7950,you can change ai for electricity or internet and pretty much the same remains true
7952,2:57 i love roberto - he keeps it real!
7954,best comment i've seen in the whole comment section. you are actually giving a meaningful solution for this probelm
7955,yeah because i’m available to help with government in africa - but you have to feed me for salary and we’re going to get some good water as my first objective!  maybe south america?
7957,that's why we need our representatives on this. but they are ignoring it. we need free schools to retrain the public.
7959,human mismanagement of resources for profit sake over the past 100 plus years is the problem as we transition into an efficient system run by ai. the human tradition of capitalism will be our biggest problem going forward.
7961,what if ai figures out that accounting should have been mandatory in the schools since sputnik? and economists should have been talking about planned obsolescence?
7964,"pinkos now using ai fearmongering to promote ubi, income redistribution, and other communist filth."
7966,"and consider the fact that they have already laid off thousands of people in china who were making less than $2,000 a year with robotic noodle chefs. can you live on less than $2,000 a year in the united states"
7967,"and as fast as new jobs can be created, they'll be able to set up ai and robotics to do them.

in the places where ai cannot directly replace workers, it will vastly increase the productivity of workers you still have jobs. for example i can write a program and half the time with ai now and i can write a 3 act script in about a third the time."
7969,aip palantir
7970,"can’t we just politely refuse? i want to live in a world with trees, not robots. and being told profound changes are inevitable, does not feel like freedom."
7971,"you’re a biological machine. and you haven’t truly free will, it’s just an hallucination. (like chatgpt hallucinations).
so no, you’ll not stop the course of the universe."
7972,"if ai companies don't develop and roll out ai carefully, they will encounter a public backlash, possibly even violent, that they would be wise to avoid.  disrupting people's livelihoods doesn't come without consequences."
7973,today the public backlash is mostly coming from politicians and news media (like this video) that lack the proper understanding of what ai is and what a large language model is.
7974,"ofc people hate losing their jobs. everyone has heard the stories of luddites who smashed sowing machines, but today we still use sowing machines..."
7975,"they would release it silently, like you wouldn't know ai already removed customers service job years ago"
7976,lies again? aia money wbc
7984, kids are going to get the tiktok brainrot
7986,"also a professional coder

i think the best skill you can teach your kids is being flexible, curious and be willing to learn on their own. the world is changing pretty fast so or they are able to adapt or they'll end up homeless."
7987,"homeschooled

*full proof

wow. who'd have thought huh"
7991,tax ai  each request schould be taxed
7995,"too much hype on this hype ai. humans are always innovative because they interact with the society which a machine can not.
other jobs  will be created it simple as that. when farming  machines when introduced did people  became jobless for that long even when robots were introduced in manufacturing other jobs for people were created."
7996,"ai will take years/decades to reduce lots of jobs. enough time for the current generation to stop having kids or have less kids so that the population will gradually decrease a lot.

may be total earth population of 1-3 billion perhaps as the jobs disappear."
7999,"all i would say is, good luck putting the divine inside of a robot - the joke is on whoever has wrongly convinced themselves that you can recreate a human artificially.  sad really, because it comes from a place of misunderstanding and lies.  namaste."
8009,everybody's worried about money money money money money money money money money money money money money money money money really is that the solution no that is not the solution something else is better who has a brain to figure this one out
8010,i remember back in the 80s when the computer entered the factory everyone said all the office workers would loose their jobs and many floor workers would be replaced by robots. guess what productivity and jobs went up. these talking heads are clueless and the biggest dummy is robert reich.
8015,i see most people pivoting to manual labor jobs. the advent of ai demonstrates that it is easier to emulate our minds than our physiology (even million dollar robots cannot do some tasks we do).
8016,"that ship has sailed.   many robots are about 100k or less now.

amazon is really close to having packing robots will will eliminate 10's of thousands of jobs.

we've passed the inflection point.   

and that doesn't even require agi. once agi arrives, then you're talking a full replacement human. and that ignores the tremendous risk of asi."
8018,you don’t need to be humanoid to all the jobs. there are tons of specialised robots that can do each specific jobs much better and faster than humans
8020,"...just like machines, automats and robots can do physical tasks that we cannot do...or do very slowly and unprecise."
8022," yes in an industrial setting. but whenever you exit the factory humans are dominant (particularly construction), and humanoid robots are prohibitively expensive. i don't admit that robots will replace manual industries but i see ai replacing cognitive jobs much faster than robotics for manual."
8025,you want to know what a jobless/ welfare community looks like? look at the so called “parallel societies” in sweden.
8028,ai
8029,ai
8030,i can't see any progress in ai. all it can do for today is to give wrong answers and compose simple imitative texts.
8031,"how about predicting protein folding, identifying cancer or helping to synthesize new materials... just 3 examples where it is superior."
8032,because you're not smart enough to get involve in the development or having hard time findding current ai news?
8036,"bro once they control ai gdp won’t matter, if will be corporate feudalism. people will still be desperate and they’ll work for what they’re given, and if it isn’t enough they’ll just die."
8038,"intelligence is power and power transcends money and equals wealth. be certain that whatever happens to the economy or economics as we know it, those who control ai will control the world."
8041,ai was supposed to automate work so that humans could spend time in art. ai automated art so humans could work more
8042,i'm an ai eng. you still have to have the creativity to write the prompts but i understand what you mean
8047,"fun fact: they people who know how to utilize the large language models they refer to as ai get paid quite well.

if you want to be paid more maybe you should develop the skills that will allow you to demand more money."
8050,the average salary of an ai scientist at ooenai is 900k usd 
8052,what concerns me is the ideology people / government coding ai.
8056,perfectly said
8057,how do you get educated by gaming??? are you just pulling stuff from thin air?
8058," your lack of imagination is daunting, education based game with vr and ai has been on the rise the last few years, how about get out of the house once in a while?"
8062,"the rich and powerful dont care either way.
soon the conspiracy theorists will brag "" we told yuh so! haha!"""
8067,imagine the ai decides that what you care about is not ideal and it has a better approach.
8068,"why would it? anything smart enough to have such control.. would also be aware that average people have their own interests, and it doesn't get to speak for them, or tell them otherwise. and introducing such a conflict would only be counterproductive to the ai's goals."
8070,"ai paired with automation absolutely can replace labor and already has. walmart uses ai for their cameras and sensors and have replaced cashiers already. it’s over bro, poor people are obsolete"
8071,"your point is moot because those jobs were replaced prior to ai. re-read my comment above to understand what's happening now.  future iterations will impact jobs in the lower end of the market, but that's still several years away, if no decades. "
8072,"have tried using ai in a creative field. and enthusiasm aside it only generates the most basic stuff ever made. there will always be a need for a creative curator that can adapt everything for human nuances. 
it gives me some ideas sometimes, but what it can generate is very raw."
8073,"a few more examples: ai will completely revolutionize medical research, software engineering, and hardware engineering in the near term. all of those jobs are at the top."
8074,".14name i make my entire living with the adobe creative suite. the ai features save me hours of work everyday. it’s astounding. it’s completely changed my life. currently, in the creative field, you need a human to supervise the ai, and put the final touches. but ai is 1 year old. what will that process look like in 5 years?"
8075,"one thing to notice is when they talk about ai replacing labor they show stock footage of a robot picking fruit.

something that not only doesn't require ai but is something chatgbt would never be able to said in (they think large language models like chatgbt is ai)

this video is luddite fear mongering."
8077,"ai may not be perfect, but it currently outperforms people in many areas. because of that, companies may replace ""professionals"" with ai. it's already happening in the medical field because ai gives more accurate diagnoses. turbo tax has an ai tax assistant that is being rated higher than the real assistants. give it a few years."
8080, your example is literally the case of ai just being a tool for a softie. not replacing the doctor. you think insurance is going to ok a cancer treatment not signed off on from a doctor?
8082,ai is different the job loss won't be able to be replaced by new jobs. we will have higher unemployment and because of that wages will come down. more people will end up in poverty and probably trigger an uprising.
8083,"unlike any other technology before, ai replaced labor and creative. it makes the poor obsolete."
8085," there will be some new jobs gain but mostly will be lost. which new jobs will be gained? ai prompt engineering? meanwhile ai will be able to replace programmers, artists, accountants, marketing, content creators and so on. there is no adaption but only a dead end."
8086, people don’t understand how powerful ai is…they think it’s just another cotton machine that replaces one sector lol
8091,how is jeffrey sachs on the thumbnail photo of this video? dudes a hack that knows nothing about ai or economics.
8093,"public education will become obsolete, because using ai would become cheaper than employing human teachers who are teacher union members."
8094,"public education is doomed because it's controlled unions (arguably illegal) whose is main motivation is to increase the number of due payers not to invest in eductors who tech well informed students.

public education is on the way out and it has very little ai."
8096,"this century will see the end of capitalism. what’s next ? probably a new scientific harmonic society governed by ai. who knows. 
or a dystopian corporates dictatorship governed by money-men. (cleptocratism)
but we need to do the choice now."
8103,i can't wait till the power goes out and i don't have to go to therapy online anymore
8104,i am so excited. the new industrial revolution is approaching. yay!!!
8111,misleading title. bait for clicks . this youtuber just do every bad things just for clicks
8112,there is an ai expert. and he talks about the future of programming and business. i'm confused. oh and there's python....
8114,thank you man. i working as web dev 10 years (js). how i understood - time to learn new field
8118,thank you very much. i will do what you said as my mentor
8121,great video spot on earned a subscriber
8124,i use ai to make python scripts all the time. i love python :) so easy!
8127,"or ... u could become a plumber like ur dad told u2. when the sht hits the fan ... we gonna need a sht load of plumbers, and ai don’t use hand tools..."
8128,sagemaker is the excel of ai.
8129,"ai is mostly for big data, used by big corporations."
8130,"most ai jobs req ms or phd in math, or data science, 5 years exp, managing teams in large corporations."
8134,cool video)
8135,you are genius!
8136,good video!
8137,"those are good examples, but why don't you consider the possibility that even programming itself could be replaced? "
8138,this is great news. started learning python today after i finally woke up and accepted ai is here to stay and the best thing i can do for myself is to not miss this second wave of huge opportunity to become a developer and a pioneer of new uncharted businesses.
8139,"what bullshit .... now way more website will made i mean who cares if the local coffe shop has a website like wtf ...
also i dont know how will economy work if 80 percent become jobless will just buy stuf to survive thats it not luxury"
8145,"i took a year of computer programing back maybe before you were born but life took me a different path, retired and thinking i need a winter hobby. thanks, worth a sub..."
8147,i am learning so much from watching your videos. thank you so much for sharing this amazing source of information. this one is quite helpful.
8148,short and good clear opinion
8152,data science is the boat of ai 
8154,"as an ""ai"" expert you should know that there's no ai and there will never be one"
8155,"can someone please explain? when i finished my first python course in school, the teacher keeps on enthusiastically saying there's a lacl of cloud developers and it's the future. i'm really passionate about doing data science/ python development for ai but the cloud developer path also seems promising. can somebody please give an insight?"
8157,tawara collar thank you so much all my family people's there in this english compress i appreciate small my like me today generating me i appreciate with that my family n a i a goat ada lilahi to put business people in aia make i love you in words to be a happiness wasilla
8161,"i really appreciate this video. there is so much doomerism in the tech space right now and this is a genuinely uplifting thing to hear. there's still a chance, you just have to position yourself correctly as always"
8162,"dead wrong. this guy is extending coding to ai, this is apple vs orange. every ai project is a science project in itself, there is no applicable toolkit you can apply at low cost. just ask the consultancies."
8163,ai will take over developing and programming.
8164,ai replaces..non tech....
8165,each problem has different solution ai can have industry specific templates or libraries that can be can be tailored to solve a problem
8167,"i was doing ai implementations for over a decade, but now the market has exploded with ""ai developers"". but ai is a farcry from being that useful and python kinda sucks as a language."
8171,"as with all things tech... ai will just end up creating tailed, waifu bots.

i wish i was wrong but this solves many problems and creates bigger ones.

time to find a husbando, ladies before it becomes a reality"
8173,how did you find those tail end jobs?
8176,"​.8805these would be your standard regression and classification models which have to be bespoke to the use case of the specific client. lead generation. price prediction. churn likelihood. probability to fail.

 this is the whole job of a data scientist. i don't understand how this is news to anybody"
8179," in my experience, the machine learning engineering part is much easier to replace than the data science part. actually understanding what a good solution is can be very nuanced"
8182, in banking its know how of domain. without it data can say anything but means nothing. just predicting a curve that cannot be explained to regulators is dangerous
8184, simple point is that everything fits for busines purpose. if domain is not known no matter who you hire will produce absolutely nothing. it will keep on making digital trash. if you dont start with business problem then no models can help it
8190,"only humans would create machines, then train those machines to learn, then debate whether or not those machines will take your job... lol 

of course computers will eventually write themselves. our hubris is hilarious"
8191,"i love that he said, ""grounding"" in python, llm and ml... love this pun, not sure how many people got it but i smiled when i heard. if you don't know what ""grounding"" is....yeah "
8193,"subscription mate
your content is nice!"
8197,ai taking over jobs is only a positive thing. it's the same exact thing that happened with industrialization.
8198,thousands of ais will be born
8199,python...oh my word......good luck.
8204,"a lot of companies are still making data entry on dead end excels split into 100 files, each one for each month since 2013, ai is far from being a thing in 90% of current companies. take in mind that companies like google meta amazon and those ones are in the 0.001% percentile."
8207,r u the ai expert? or is this click bait ser 
8211,thank you travis! i'm writing this comment as a commitment to myself that i am going to start and complete your blueprint 
8212,nice talk.
8213,"this is very interesting and kind of aligns with my thoughts or focuses on applying ai (outside of software and consumer tech) but i hate writing python lol i learned development writing c++ so i’ve always gravitated towards things like java, js, c# (kinda) but i guess i should brush up on my python."
8214,do you have an opin ion on the r language vs python for ai?
8215,r is mainly used for data analysis python is better. python is much more ubiquitous and has an enormous amount of libraries and modules already built on top of the base language. moreover everything that you can do in r you can do in python and more
8216," thank you, i appreciate it"
8217,"if ai is cheaper and better even filling senior positions, the only job left will be entrepreneur. ai can help with that too. so output will go up tremendously as supply constraints vanish. our only limitation would be time to consume."
8220,"i love ai, i am a robotics and mechatronics engineer and i hate coding from scratch, so ai is good for that. i prefer to modify code that i get ai to write from scratch and then get ai to check it and optimise it. i like ladder programming and assembly by myself, as i like to run it in my mind step by step."
8221,"in 2 years we will have human level ai assistents that are experts in everything, there will be no need for developers"
8222,"from a senior software engineer at a huge bank: ai is the future... but the future is pure garbage.  we are currently having a problem with people even understanding the basics of json and yaml and when you throw in an llm engine that just regurgitates stupidity... well... we are all doomed.  good luck, everyone."
8223,if a person is skilled in ai and he learns api developement and front end developement... dont you think he is future secured ? what your take on this ....
8224,having worked in tech i agree with the original comment. i don't see how someone with a background in ai learning rudimentary full-stack development helps with the issue -101
8225,i’m also a senior (cloud) engineer at a large financial company… i don’t think the problem you describe is an ai problem. 
8226,-101no.  it’s the same way a really good set of tools won’t make a bad carpenter any better at building a good house.
8227,"that's one of the many issues: ai cannot be double checked for consistency and accuracy in it's answers/outcomes.
so, unless you are a very skilled professional that knows what is bs and what is not, many entry level professionals could potentially get stuck in something that doesn''t work and that they are unable to make it work."
8228,"bro why do i have to look at your clueless face while listening to ng's wisdome? doesn't make any sense. lol
instead make a shorts videso mentioning the timestamp of that video of ai lord andrew ng :)"
8231,thank you for this!!! just rejuvenated me :)
8232,i just really want to develop and deploy my own ai assistant. jarvis!
8233,"i'm looking into completing, and engineering degree but very tempted to pursue a career into ai have i missed my opportunity as the field appears to be advancing at an alarming rate, would i be better doing a different engineering degree such as mechanical or electronics in a hope that i could integrate ai into those at a later date?"
8234,aws machine learning cert was a waste of time imho
8237,"why learn python when you could be programming in julia.  it's much faster, more powerful,  has far better syntax and also has all the machine learning libraries you will ever need.  if you need those python libraries you can call them from julia as well."
8238,mainly because python is so much more widely adopted compared to julia.
8239,because python is good enough.
8240,"lol, good luck by the deployment. deployments are much smoother and easier with python. even r is sometimes just a pain to deploy..."
8241,"to me, ai is like a super computer that only big tech has a luxury to train and deploy it, just like an old day before ai is accessible to everyone even grandma."
8242,thousands of companies that will fail.
8244,i am loving the interpretation for “c” students 
8246,"it’s just pronounced “ing” like “sing”-s. you don’t have to act cool man, you’re 50, just be nice and present the information."
8250,"ai ain’t gonna replace crap. i don’t know ai but as an enterprise developer, i know what we are expecting ai to replace…  not gonna happen "
8253,can you explain what you mean here?
8255,i feel you didn't really distinguish between software development and ai careers
8256,i'm glad im a python developer lmao.
8257,"ai blueprint is not presented in the video, just a link to the blueprint"
8258,"i am a freelance developer and i was waiting for these ai tools to start building ai solutions for clients. and here they are, the public llms and so forth. i share your view that i can be an ai developer without having to be a machine learning engineer. i really enjoy when you comment on an interesting presentation. great video !"
8265,exactly this. i think it guys programmers etc will have job for 5 or 6 years max. after you can say good bye. according to elon musk agi will be a reality in 3 years.
8269,"lol ive started learning cybersecurity too just out if defense
 for the future but its nice to know this too. my career is trading and its made me good income but i debate whether or not ai could render trading useless"
8271,thank you so much. i own a small seo ai saas bootstrapped to 10k mrr with no marketing and i really am frustrated by my lack of code knowledge. i plan on learning python now.
8272,let’s chat. i’m a senior python dev and been wanting to launch an ai saas. we may be able to work with each other
8276,thanx bro ... i'm a next.js/node.js dev and i've seen libs like langchain have everything that python libs have ... do i have to learn python? can't i build all js solutions?
8277,"im a software engineer, not a programmer, and haven't written any code at work in a few months

when ai is able to replace the actual responsibilities of a software engineer, it will be capable of replacing any job"
8279," it is not a case of replacing all sw engineers, its about creating less jobs for them cuz they wont be as competetive as ai"
8284,"ai is still stupid. weren't we all supposed to have self driving cars by now?? - -yeah, no.. because its all advertising bs..."
8288,i talked with a guy who is using chatgpt to help him with his programming.  sad part was he told me he is losing his ability to critically think and to solve problems.  and it's definitely not perfect and it will give you an answer that really isn't a good solution on occasion.
8294,"these are good videos thank you, i am a 2nd degree compsci career change guy in my 30s; these vids help w optimism and entrepreneurship"
8295,i'm a junior dev and i just got a job at a small ai consulting company. maybe this guy is onto something
8306,"thank you, travis! i've been following you for a while and i'd say the content you produce helps me a lot on my programming journey. thanks again for sharing valuable knowledge which is quite rare to find."
8308,"lol if we get agi and we don't need developers, us developers will just be able to build any software that companies has, so what happens next ? everyone is a ceo yay. chaos is coming my friends. damn, wish we could go back to 2016, the best year to have lived, after that everything became shit.,"
8310,ai experts… can’t wait for these grifters to dissolve like blockchain experts.
8314,"we know every solution creates a problem, e.g. cars are mostly responsible for road accidents and pollution. just wait and watch the problem created by ai"
8315,"you have nice videos but your website blocks itself for silly us sanctions when no other website blocks itself for that silly issue, so its better to tell youtube not to show this creator anymore"
8318,andrew ng was pioneer and had wide knowledge of old ai. his videos helped lot of people.  i have not heard him talk anything substantial about transformers and large language models
8321, thank you!
8322,​ said great azure solution and cert  but free blueprint link says aws. do you have a free blueprint for azure? or does the the aws blueprint apply to both? great clip all the same
8324,"coding is really interesting. my sister used to be a coder now she’s a ba. she gets paid more than coders, has way less stress and for the past 3 years been getting huge jump in salaries. i’ve seen her on a few zoom calls and i always hear devs and testers under so much pressure i feel it’s an industry that’s not as fun as it sounds."
8336,ng is pronounced as ung but dont worry ai will do this job for you
8337,it looks like the machine learning career path link is invalid…
8338,"in 1908, a horse n buggy professional said,  ""that model t car will put us good ol hard workers outta business"". in 2023 a software developer said ""this ai is gonna put us out if business""... in the words if thanos ""it is inevitable"" "
8342,"thanks for the video, yeah the point is that software development as profession will be extinct the way typist was in the 1980's cause everybody can write anything anywhere. 

in 3-5 years anybody can program anything anywhere."
8346,"@romamdau, i have built software startups for the last 20 years with three successful exits, starting as a software engineer. i know it's not all about coding, but what part of software engineering do you think cannot be augmented and automated by ai?  we're doing that now.  please don't be ignorant. the world evolves fast."
8349," probably you a more developed country am from kenya ,africa the field is too fresh to be replaced by ai"
8354," hmm, that's a great idea! i'll have to start over again into python though, it's been many months. thank you again!"
8356," thanks marc! well, a few days ago i enrolled in a harvard cerificate online program for intro to python....burnt about 10+ hrs on it, all seemed fine, got to my 1st lab exercise and completely failed, i unenrolled. at least i'll get a refund. i'm just dumber than a rock. oh well."
8363,very helpful. i am grateful
8367,python is the defacto language for ai/ machine learning/ data science. but id argue mojo will most likely be the future as it is basically a superset of python.
8370, not against. mojo. mojo is faster and more performant than python.
8375,are you ai data scientist  if not why talking and teaching people ai? another bait for clicks professional youtuber
8376,because only data scientists can talk about ai.
8379,very good at writing python?
8380,"as a guy who runs an ai consultancy firm, this is an illusion. coding is like 10% of the job. the main problem is the training data (to acquire, label, prepare,  etc), and i don't see much improvement in the last 3 years."
8382,apparently ai is now creating it's own training data
8385, lol! i'm so excited to see the outcome of this!  a super powerful bullshit generator that eats it's own excrement ...what could possibly go wrong?
8386,i also have small ai business consultancy and for us the main issue is to get clients on the line what ai/ml can and cannot do. sometimes their expectations are just from another planet
8390,"@smortlogician9258 let me explain in simple terms, at the moment ai is just an imitation machine, they don't create .. just imitate someone else. if you use ai to catalogue something that has never been catalogued, the machine will try and fail, you need a human to bring more information into the system so the machine can imitate better"
8394,he runs an ai consultancy firm not the solution to mankinds problems 
8395,also data procurement and munging are like most of the work. training testing and maintenance. lot of work still goes to develop and maintain a product. what if the requirements change and we need to rewrite everything . quality data in long tail scenarios will be the main focus i guess.
8400,"damn !!! finally found someone who knows.
having worked on endless poc's and finding patterns for use cases.
you sir are giving reality of ai/ml .
why isn't this comment blown up yet."
8402,what's the job called who research the data for engineers to put in ai?
8405,nice take on it many thanks.
8406," i absolutely love the term ""imitation machine"". it suits perfectly to the current state of ai."
8407,"​ probably forever, considering ai can't really imagine."
8408,can i privately talk to you about this ai consultancy firm? any form of contact would be great. thanks!
8409,@practicalai_ can i privately talk to you about this ai consultancy firm? any contact works. thanks!
8410,i can see this is a great start 
8412,and my friend that is the reason microsoft released copilot. it is being branded as something which is helping you speed up. but under the hood you are training the model with your day to day work
8413,"​- some kinds of systems can certainly find patterns in huge data sets that humans cannot. 

and as for transformer models  -- event they start directly training on, you know, the actual physical universe. plenty of data there."
8414,​ scientist who also knows ml and ai
8420,"a lot of ai is overblown. i can see it taking copywriters jobs, and not all of them, just some of them, but that’s it. it’s not good enough to take anybody else’s jobs"
8421, just wait for the next version... and the next... and the next... it's got no limit to its development.
8425,there are tom dick and harry running ai consultancies in name of body shopping simple data and project management tasks
8426,"great comment, what did he say that you disagree with?"
8427," that is a stupid solutions , training data should be real data"
8428, ...and falling into negative feedback loop. deteriorating a little bit every time it eats ai generated training data.
8432,"these opportunities evaporate when/if agi comes along, though. maybe that's a year our. maybe 50 years out. one of the concerning dynamics. if we stick with the current ai capabilities, then there will certainly be plenty of work for devs. i'm not really expecting any plateaus in progress just yet..."
8439, if the q* rumours are true then it's game over. self-improving ai with limitless synthetic data.
8443," ha! good one. i'm not nostradamus by any means, just waiting to see where the chips fall like everybody else."
8444,"very good. just as it has been foretold in the book ""the cyber ai of the law""."
8445,fantastic video! really enjoyed watching it. thanks for sharing.
8446,"im 30 years old, doing masters in tax and learning to code. but i had passion for soccer my whole life . i always wondered if i would make a good coach. guess now is a good a time as any..."
8447,why masters in tax and learning code. you could have done masters in ai or something!
8449,make php great again - pieter levels 2020
8452,yes but this is a part of the ai consultant job to advice them how to collect good data.
8453, far easier said then done. there will be a ton of office politics that a good consultant would have to manage in order to leverage the full capability of ai. department heads won't give up their data (power) easily .
8454, yes but as a programmer i can tell you that being good at office politics is more important than being good at programming unfortunately.
8455, most definitely. that's been my experience as a team lead. ai is a different animal entirely though. adaption will lead to people losing their jobs/careers.
8457," i imagine everyone is under pressure to show some ai/ml ""wins"". however, any truly successful ai implementation has to take a wholistic approach for the entire organization."
8459,what do you think is the best way to organize the data infrastructure? surely there are newer companies who could do so from their inception and be a valuable proof of concept
8461,taiwan not think so
8462,excellent  .
8464,"since everyone is moving to python, it's the good time to move away from python. "
8467,that switch wont save you. this is doubling down in the direction of intelligence which is precisely the direction which wil get eaten. altough it seems weird i would focus on things like diplomacy or types of jobs were social skills are key.
8468,the best solution is to sell ai bootstrap career certification class so that when they start hiring you will have the 20 years of experience required and they will hire you instead of the the phd from stanford. /s
8480,"ignorant post. it is right - for a moment, a generation of ai or three, then it is over. there are no real jobs left long term. and long term is not next generation of humans - not the way things go now."
8481,"thank you, travis! i've been following you for a while and i'd say the content you produce helps me a lot on my programming journey. thanks again for sharing valuable knowledge which is quite rare to find."
8485,ai is the biggest example of creative destruction in recent memory. it will wipe out many and replace with much much more...unless some party poopers get in the way.
8486,lol. you are such a naive man.... do you believe santa claus and the easter bunny too?
8491,"am so glad i came across this channel.new subscriber here, and just as you mentioned i went down that cloud path with aws and i even got the foundation ccp certification. focusing on building my python skills"
8496,"the problem with all these companies is the legacy software. you need a way to enter and edit the data. where the opportunity is, is creating an ai that can be trained to use these software."
8498,"andrew ng: ""ng"" is pronounced like ""eng"" as in the way ""engelbert humperdinck"" is pronounced by americans. an ai pioneer in his own right, he's also a fellow techno-optimist and effective accelerationist."
8503,"""ai expert"" - translation: a person who has never programmed a computer, but knows more than you, because they once did a business course, and they subscribe to the wallstreetjournal"
8506,"thanks travis, great video, and i've been grinding my python skills for quite some time, hope it all pays off soon!"
8507,"hello, how much good are you in python? i've just started and learnt basics. now i'm about to learn oop and ds. where should i go next?"
8509,thank you!
8510,"really enjoying your content. i'm buying you a cup of coffee for the guide. 
not all heroes wear capes!"
8511,"there's never been a perfect time for one to get into hacking, as humans are relying more and more on machines, but a very important decision that one will have to make is which color of hacking hat one wears, will it be white or black?"
8515,"in my opinion, yes, it's a fine first language to start out with. others will vehemently disagree. such is the nature of programmers. try it out, see if you like it. be sure to nail the programming concepts down so if you do switch to something else, you'll find it much easier. i do wish you the best."
8522,noy until porn is ai generated
8523,"there has always been developer oportunities for small use cases. think of the plug in writers for all sorts of applications and use cases. right now,  people are slapping .ai on everything like it's monkfruit or stevia"
8527,"the title is not click bait, i found the video interesting because hes not talking about ai taking code jobs, hes talking about ai creating more code jobs"
8530,"i believe the effect of ai progress will be similar to the increase of computing power and tool development. it will tremendously increase the requirements of software development jobs. forty years ago, people could work as web developers by simply knowing html and css, but now we need to master several frameworks"
8531,sorry but i’m not as enthusiastic about ai. i believe it will lower the need for software engineers and human design creativity will be taken out of the equation.
8532,"ya im worried about lowering the need for software engineers too, but i think we are quite a ways from that. ive found that most people who preach that you will soon lose your code job to ai, are often selling something / inveested in the tech. but also, theres nothing we can do to stop it, so we may as well be ready ."
8533,think the same but do look into new careers that are already here. like ai engineers and ai operations ( not the very high skilled ml engineers)
8541," ""truck directly replaced the horse"". exactly man. the trucks were to replace the horse, not the people who operates them.
ai is here to replace programmers, not to replace our computers, ides or keyboards.
not the same."
8546,i soo agree developers are soo excited abt ai but there is a distinct possibility it will suck out most of the joy out of coding.
8548,ai is just statistics. stop worrying too much
8549,"for sure i agree. when a human job can be replaced by a machine that is just a bit better, that is all capitalists need to see for them to cut costs on human labor."
8551,"guys, ai will destroy everything
we will all be replaced, whether one is a software engineer, banker or things like that
my advice: do not read only about web development, read also about how the world works, you'll understand many other things"
8554,i don’t think coz fields will expand due ai
8555,"was there ever a ""need"" for such ""creativity""? the vast majority of the frontend is just awful. would not it be nice if all those sub par developers and designers are kicked out?"
8559,"@brandongiordano  i think this is wishful thinking of the highest order, but i sincerely hope you're right.  all evidence seems to point the contrary. 

 the point of agi is that it will be as capable as humans and will surpass our abilities.  why would the rich and powerful pay us to do anything they could do better and cheaper?"
8562,we'll laugh in 10 years time having watched all the companies crash that tried to save money using ai for their main way of producing code and seeing it  all fall apart in a beautiful buggy mess.
8568,really nice info thnks..
8573,great info @connorskudlarek8598!
8580,"i've not spent any time hands-on with mojo, but thanks for the mention as i need to take a look at it. do you have experience with it? thoughts?"
