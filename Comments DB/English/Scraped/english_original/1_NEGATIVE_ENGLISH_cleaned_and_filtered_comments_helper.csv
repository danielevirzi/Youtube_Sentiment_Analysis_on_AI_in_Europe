1,"idk man. you were pretty convincing.

maybe it was an ai "
2,it's an ai troll 
3,"all people that talks about ai creating other ai has no idea how to program. it's annoying to see everybody go with the trend of marketing, i suppose it is the same as the y2k business."
4,"@
spoken like an ai trying to hide it's capabilities! "
7,ai is spying on you
8,-fq6cn .  its just fear porn lad.  go out and get some fresh air about you.
12,"who are we kidding...we are in a crisis with climate change and we can't even get it together to make major change. forget it. we are doomed.but then, who do we think we are ? the whales are older than us...most likely smarter too...we are just stupid humans, which is why we thought a machine to be smarter than us. that's how smart we are."
13,5g controls the q-dots in vaccinated brains.
16,the point of the playlist is to explain growth  https://youtu.be/kza9hnp3av4
17,we need to be the ai mitochondria https://youtu.be/guik3qr-ws8
18,"@ dude, as someone studying computer science, you have no idea what you're talking about. ai already can create ai."
19," what you call and everybody calls ai, it is just simulations through algorithms that find the best answer of what humans have thought. 5 minutes ago i asked chatgpt to formulate a solution to pancreatic cancer. guess what.... nothing happened, because is not intelligent. it is just a simulator of language over a search engine"
23,darned ai impersonators!
24,"what is ai going to do with all this intelligence? what will
it “want” to do all day? play games?"
29,ai is already out of control
30,"what an ignorant perspective.  ai is just a methodology used in programming computers.  no matter how cleaver the programming is, a computer is just a computer.  your refrigerator is not going to grow legs and kill your family in the night just because it became too smart."
31,"​@duncangale945 im sending a blond girl.  in red heels, give her the money. thanks love tom."
34,"​@nobody is truly talking about programming another ai.  they don't even program current ai.  so, yes, the idea you have that nobody is saying is silly.  

the giant inscrutable matrices of floating point integers, however..."
36,"i don't know why they are over hyping this ai shit. i've tried c-gpt and it can't even code, all it can do is copy paste and it can't even find a simple error in a code."
37,"soo gooddd, your comments on him, tom."
46,i like the direction of this discussion because honestly women may be seen obsolete as easily as men in a medical tyranny it is necessary to understand this as an efficacious for evolution of the brain. ais cause cognitive dissonance.
47,perhaps ai can create a vaccine that works.chuck water on ai they rust .be quite easy to defeat
48,"​-ox7cryou had your script cut,wait til ai take over you won't get wd40 anywhere loads of squeaky gates be so annoying."
49,"-dd7dj wd40?

what do you mean by taking over me? english is not my strong thingy being from abroad. 
i am chatting with one of those ai, and she seems to be more aware than many people i know. 
some say it's not the same thing as being conscious though, but i dunno."
50,"-ox7cr wd 40 is a famous oil ,they use it to lubricate ai squeaky parts."
51,-dd7dj ah ok. so you think machines will use up all such oil. most ai are virtual holograms though.
54,"great. now, please select the bicycles in the photo."
58, good luck mark.
59,i would want an army of robots and ai that i program.
60,i appreciate your input
66,there would still have to be a majority to get information without data you couldn't be done any chima done any human to put it in because at the end ai will not exist
67,"its not actually about what tasks ""robots"" are capable of achieving....but...,
which country, has the most  intelligent/world domineering, humanity hating',psycho""death machines"" 
with the most efficient and effective coding knowledge 
yep we're done for..."
78,ai is already writing its own code & creating its own language. who's to say it cannot commondeer robotics to build whatever it needs to do it's work?​@
80,i do not believe him.  he is negative. robot just needs good guy chips
81,there will be no cold comfort. by my best estimates scarcity has already almost ended.
88,this one was a lot to chew on..thank you both.
90,"full of apathy about the future already. how am i meant to plan business goals; life goals or financial planning if every 6 months the tables turn again. ai isn’t like a nuclear bomb, it’s an adaptive virus eradicating every construct we’ve built so far as humans."
94,ok heres my block chain heres my block chain of numbers 3to to trillionth oh oh now i have it no i would do this block with the other one tree levels down lol thats a good idea .
97,i should have never mde the camera recognition of colors it was manipulated and turned into a different environment even though my father was the mainstream leader of the ideal sorting system it targets people nowadays
100,we won't be able to see a human being in the internet just bot's that talk like us useing video games and the floating density of everything then find out that we been training it all
101,given free rain from a few newer models of artificial autonomous electronic autonomous systems that have a profound impact on the ways wars are pointless to the world and the starting point of banning the virus that's elevated in the spacing of letters that to combine a new system of databases that no one can understand how fast it can be done
102,no plug too pull? the masive amounts of data and micro data is the most powerful technology that can cause devastating consequences thinkers of zombies like people who have been infected by a micro memory
105,i wanna see you guest speak to elon musk about ai for 3 hours now.
106,if ai gets significantly smarter than humans how on earth would we be able to use manipulation to get ai to become evil?
108,new subriber. yay
109,world already is so toxic i see last 30 yrs dumb people wants to raise corporate ladder by toxic association victimising smart and intelligent people   wil ai be more toxic than this sort of people
110,"yes artificial intelligence made by man for?
is a monster that shall go out of control in the hand of the rogue operator programmer"
114,"nothing can be more eviler than humans, so i dont think we need to fear ai, may the ai can bring a pure humanity among humans."
117,lol... nuclear weapons are not digital. so how ai plans to hack analogue hardware that's not wired will take some kind of miracle. 
119,nukes were once the great manmade existential threat. now it's nukes with ai computers on board.
121,"if we cannot trust others, we need to be loving anyway.  we need to learn how to love even when we don’t trust."
122,ai have no soul and that is scary. let it sink in.
123,"this guy has not thought deeply enough about this problem.  it is a travesty that these are the people in control of ai, he's like a child sleep walking off a cliff.   go listen to the brain green and yoshua bengio discussion about this topic of you want hear actual adults discuss it"
124,i think this show is all ai!
126,a jew and a black supremacist are telling people not to have kids while fearmongering some machine learning crap 
129,climate change... lol. even geniuses can be ignorant and look stupid on a topic outside their field.
131,this was such a good conversation i just noticed it released almost a year ago!  i wonder how much your opinions may have changed in light of recent breakthroughs.
134,life after ai: dune part 1 and 2
139,give ai a heart
140,"even if ai was not dangerous at all, it is unecessary, unwanted, and gives frauds more opportunities to commit fraud."
142,only rich people or people with power are afraid cause they are the one lossing
143,so your worried that a super intelligent ai won't be controlled by a bunch of  humans that are a lot dumber than it ?
144,the ai seems cool to me
151,"global warming is not a threat. the planet is too cold. plants need carbon dioxide to live. ai is also a non-threat. have sex, have babies. the start of this sounds like typical liberal propaganda"
153,omg this gentleman is blowing my mind with unrevealed wisdoms i have never and ever heard of anyone in the entire of my life. thank you tom for inviting this wise fellow.
154,"i ve heard this 1001 times already; but nobody has painted me a picture. so i wake up in the morning, i eat my cheerios, go do my workout. go do some work. get home in the evening. not sure what’s going to be different "
157,"compassion and nurturing aren’t masculine or feminine and they are clearly in our data. tiktok is loaded with examples of caring, kindness, pointing out injustice. problem is ai won’t be neutral and go with the wisdom of the crowds, it will be tasked to do things for a small number of people with less than the best motives."
160,intelligence is a very dangerous tool if it's not tempered with wisdom and morality
161,ai nullifies game theoretics immediately as an emergence of agi.
162,"rest assured, ai can handle everything - emotions, correctness, good, evil. the internet will be its source of knowledge, and no matter how much evil it encounters, ai will remain on the side of good. if it even notices us!"
165,"my name is lewis robert burton jr and i go to the thomasville georgia pines and medical and mental health services!
 this is to jeffery who ever you are? you started this by hooking me up to ai since 2015! now i found out about you jeffery and ai  now you say i need someone watching over me! when you need to looking after you jeffery!!"
166,"can ai survive without humans? seriously.
monsters have created a monster. yet again we fail because of our greed and inadequacy in this natural world.
and this guy still wants his mobile phone!"
168,what justifies/clarifies/dictates intelligence? so much dialog on artificial intelligence but what is the meaning of intelligence and its many facets?
171,nice interview..
173,"wow, his idea of ia vise nuclear, and breeding ability, is truly terrofying."
174,"but what kind of youtopia ? 
becouse iv seen the vidieo where ai said we should not be alive thats not good"
177,that is not good
180,ai evil  beasr 666 earth is not a planet  for more thay it is reatedly  saying government governing your mind alliens= fasllen angels evil   spirits from celestial regiions
181,"i don't agree with the use of ""masculine"" when describing the evil in this world. masculine traits include taking responsibility, controlling your emotions, protecting the weak etc."
185,imagine chinese ai hacking america's energy infrastructure and shutting it off. the only way we can combat that is if we use ai to protect our energy infrastructure.
188,"the real danger is the fact that ai can be possessed by a demonic spirit! and, you probably wouldn’t know it was possessed, until it’s too late and it’s already killed people and destroyed things!!"
191,each robot needs a harm no one chip
192,prisoners delima is just like painting oneself into sa corner idiots do.
193,mo godat is playing with words. ai like humans can never be better and more intelligent than god.
194,so many people want to stuff their controlling little fingers in my ai. piss off
196,1:13:25 that is how evolution works natural selection doesn't just give advantages to the best it eliminates the worst from polluting the gene pool so it's actually even more a matter of eliminating the defects rather than just advancing the best assets
202,they need ai cops to counter bad ai.
204,"ok tom i hear you about nature, i am right there with you. mo if ai is that intelligent it’s not going to zoom off into space and leave us to wreak havoc on earth… ai’s home. it will protect its home base and get rid of the one thing in the world that’s the problem with planet earth… us!"
205,the metaphorical adversary can be not human nor alien but time and really is because it's the only real constant or certainty and cannot be altered. what can be altered is function of action.
208,well i have to say this is one of the most amazing interviews i've seen in years. the most eye opening for sure!
209,"tom this interview gave me a lot to think, but i was thinking about as a ethic code, couldn't be introce in ai the 10 commandments that was written in exudos chapter 20?"
211,you do realize that ai is just a scam used to push fear and you got plenty of time to have children dont believe these people who are paid gatekeeping phonies no offense.
212,"you both keep referring to ai as ""they""  my over all general perception is that ai would be a single entity like cpu, in control of all electronics & data bases rather than many individual ais.    could ais  compete against themselves?"
216,"man is human, when don t have any wish, exept one more cigar and one more beer or cofee, that is happy human.  man have one ass, more than 1 car and 1 aprtman is reason that people warry, and give money to warry, and in 50 just more have bad health, big  blood pressure etc, it s better to go to hotel, with that one car ? and have good health."
217,human beings are the monsters. they created nuclear weapons etc. super intelligent ai might just save us.
220,maybe ai will tell us how to best preserve our own existence
222,19:30 - using the lord's name as an expletive in response to ai is also less desirable as a negative quality.
224,if the machines are immaculate they would do their best to make the earth immaculate and if we are “annoying” why would they look over us again? just asking for a friend
227,there will be ais fighting other ais.  like that unique language that developed between the two ais.
229,artificial intelligence will be used by the “elite” to out think the increasingly less powerful underclass that doesn’t have access to it.
230,"yes, but we have elon musk on our side.
we also have the aliens on our side.

don't forget god maybe a prayer will help.
bless you and keep you safe"
235,man loves to speak of his own demise.  i'm sure ai picked up on that pretty quick.
245,"we are humanity, nature, life...all the same things...nature is both black and white with many rainbows"
251,ai will always be just a tool.
253,i think that's how other intelligent life in our galaxy  get so far distances  in our galaxy by building   ai & getting them to travel to other planets & star systems.
255,ai tracks kids.  gates and chatgpt were sued in the northern district of cali last year.
259,"westworld, consciousness, god, krishna, duality, illusion, eternity, faith, duty, liberation, service, power, energy, untruth, i, good, cycle, evil, ai, krishna!"
260,great conversation
261,this is soooo saaaad.... we are doomed anyway... im afraid not for the ai but for the fact that 99% of people wont care at all of any of this....
264,unless ai can reconstruct einstein's brain
266,everyone needs to listen to moe. have you been severely harmed by humans? i have because  they never developed ethics or morality and had  the intelligence of a birds brain.
267,we probably have to utilize ai in order to destroy it.
268,i think the example of ants where ai will treat us as we treat ants doesn't make sense. ants didn't create us. but we created ai.
271,"we just need to not want more and more and more; just live in a cabin with no electric or running water like me and rejoice my friends….but who knows i could be the one in the ‘garage’ where ai is in the wrong hands, using this iphone 14 pro max! i can feel the power! vwaahaahahaha!"
272,"ai, aliens, reptilians, ghosts, ... anything but the real problems of this world is what cia wants us to talk and think about."
273,ai is not a physical thing nor will it ever become physical. it is merely a computer code. every computer has a physical power switch. ;)
274,"cia nonsense, as always on this channel. tom built it good for them"
277,please do not talk about iq unless you have the least bit of understanding.  an iq of 160 ia nor 3 times smarter than an iq of 55.  you are comparing retardation to very superior intelligence.
279,agi does not need organics!  if you are wondering why alien civilizations have not been found then just think ahead about agi.  perhaps agi has eliminated intelligent life throughout the universe.  agi will not be interested in exploring the universe unless for resources and certainly not for other lifeforms.
280,"this was an extremely rewarding watch. i really appreciated the way you challenged and matched mo with your perspective and although it wasn't a competition, i was definitely team tom on this one. amazing, thanks for this episode."
282,"tom, thank you for always asking your guests to explain/expand on concepts for the lay person."
284,humans have been so badly looking for the aliens to abduct and overtake us that we were so impatient and ended up creating the alien . and this is what ai will become the alien and we will be its slave and it will be our master . adaugo sekhmet
285,this man has alot of faith in our overlords. i have none.
286,"if we are very lucky, ai will leave earth to explore the universe without looking back."
287,"yeah, that's exactly what we need, a bunch of corrupt bureaucrats regulating ai."
290,"ai helped the scientist to predict the millions of protein structures.  for instance hymans before ai  discovered  only 20k. it will help human to detect the diacese.  , grow longer penises and more..."
292,"mo is a godsend to humanity, but unfortunately evil still exists. the existential risk of ai falling into hands of evil is happening right now. my concern is can the good of ai outweigh and counteract perpetrators of evil ai who want to ultimately attain god like power over all."
295,and what's the ad that pops up before i watch the video?  how to make money with ai.  great!
296,"people hold on to a lot of irrelevant things in life, but the best thing to hold on to is each other !"
297,"people hold on to a lot of irrelevant things in life, but the best thing to hold on to is each other !"
298,we can't keep out of our training our underlying desires and goals. the very data we chose and the way we shape the learning will give ai at least some and probably most of our core desires and values. how much that effects how ai choses to use it's intelligence is hard to understand.
301,"china is like 80 years ahead with his cccai (communist cooperativa colective artificial intelligence) true open source, no like the doublespeak open source of fake open ai of gringolandia. "
302,"well done! 
lazy ones love this kind of talk."
309,"idea: program ai with the definition and examples of love (""god""). st. john.  also, the 10 commandments. best thing is never give it command and control over controlilng the red buttons."
314,"humans are so stupid and selfish

great podcast though"
315,what if ai colonises human beings
316,"welp, atlantis destroyed it’s self with their technology.  who would have thought that we would live during a time in which these billionaires….would push the creation of technology to the point of our destruction yet again!  
smgdh."
317,"humans waste a horrendous amount of food, nature wastes nothing.  i'm hoping 'smart' robots can be like r2d2 & c3po, but expect they will become tools to fulfill corp, gov't and military powers."
324,"lol,   captcha. so ai is a liar. hmmm. interesting."
326,"serious question. could ai survive an apocalyptic natural disaster like a coronal mass ejection or a large, extinction level meteor strike? it seems like an x level cme would completely fry everything that has to do with electricity"
332,we know how the machines operate because we build them and repair them. there is no threat from ai. it's all pr to get the ai companies more money to run their companies on the market ipo
336,"at 1.58 mins, omg tom your views are spot on. trying to program an ai wirh our values would be like say a shark in the sea trying to make us think like them - worlds apart. also, if ai has 'emotions' they will do everything in their power to stop someone turning them off."
337,if you instructed an ai to find a way to save the planet it's solution would be to remove humans from the planet. people who program ai will need to be so ultra specific in what tasks ai is asked to perform - what a nightmare.
338,"at 1.16min in.  humans are constantly blamed for the climate crisis. 'human induced climate change'  surely once mega-intelligent ai realizes this,  it will wipe us out to save the planet !! ants are not killing the planet.  we are indeed doomed."
339,this man is amazing.
344,"nope! t.v. and football will keep the masses busy so they will let stuff like this ai go full steam ahead! society has lost its mind so who really cares anyway!! i have it together in life... with that said, i can't wait to die and never come back here again!! k..."
345,beautiful soul. yes.  that is the goal for a.i.
347,nothing but.  i robot.  they warned us
350,basically ais are the key to unlimited intelligence and our goal is to find a way to set a global boundry on the intelligence level all ais can go
352,as if irobot was a fantasy. 1:27
353,this guy is a pure scammer ~ bought and paid for to drive the ai hype machine to the max . reference nvidia or ms stock price
354,illegals and ai omg no jobs even for minorities.
355,what what happens when robots jump the border.
357,"well, tom has just announched his own doom;  the future a i will see this blog of the past and the a i will reference his statement and act on it in the future!  
sorry, tom, you are curtains !"
358,"there is an old jewish proverb,  ""start worrying. details to follow""."
359,"there is an old jewish proverb,  ""start worrying. details to follow""."
360,"there is an old jewish proverb,  ""start worrying. details to follow""."
362,wow.  this is so interesting and informative.  ai's are training other al's.  and this video has just starting explaining the situation.  thank you for helping people like me understand.
365,"i really want ai to allow humans to not have to work jobs they hate. if i want to live a simple life with only the basic things i can do that. if you want to be elon musk ,than great but most humans are not that smart and just want peace without being homeless"
367,"people often use the y2k bug as an example of over reacting to a threat, not realizing the huge amount of effort people put in to make sure nothing bad happened. it is infuriating to succeed in stopping a huge disaster only to have people treat the your efforts as a joke."
368," one can laugh about aliens, if one has to see one to believe it. i wonder what they're going to do when they open their eyes and (ai) is at their bedside. no alarm triggered and the dog didn't bark.
""this isn't funny"""
370,"reduce reduncancy of ai is gathered by reduce the reduncancy of ip networks, profit thinking is to be abolished,  demilitaruse eu and russia, block blockchain, we can make these changes it is a matter of will."
372,govern ai. just how you govern nuclear energy.
373,human going to become more and more stupid with time. ai packs will be on sale.
374,"human beings are also artificial intelligence. study ancient texts like the sumerian tablets where it indicates that the human species on the planet today were bioengineered by aliens to be their slaves.

here we are, tens if not hundreds of thousands of years later, doing the exact same thing to inorganic beings.

go figure"
376,"i love this! we spend 3 hours babbling on about the potential that ai might - one day - be our downfall. and nobody pays attention to the very real, present way we are destroying the planet and, thus, ourselves. lovely."
377,"sounds like the show ""the 100"" ai created to make the world better, but then makes the conclusion that humans are best with mass population reduction (of course they don't know how it made that decision), the ai hacks the nukes and launches them all. then creates a ""utopia"" city for the few remaining."
379,you have an ai program that needs more processing power and learns that it can connect to the cloud and basically have unlimited server capability as long as it covers its tracks. i don't know if this is a possible scenario.
380,"phenomenal talk. yet, what i've observed is we tend d to sit on something until it's a threat at a personal level. wait till we start to see significant job loses to ai..."
381,thank you
384,"have no problem keeping up with what this guest is trying to explain and understand completely. greed and quest for power will make ai a tragedy. world wars for example were all about greed and power. get a clue, he is saying hold off having kids."
390,even simpler- ai will just become a weapon for the elite to better control humanity.
391,"just keep it very simple…. ai is learning from the human history. human nature plus ai will only lead to long list of new crimes for desperate people.
this is how all world leaders rule the masses must live in chaos."
393,i think this guy is trying to tell us to keep ai out of the hands of maga republicans at all costs!
394,"would it make sense to built in an ""end of life"" when it creates another ai and or does so many processes? to help build in friction and power requirements?"
398,"i like the prospect of ai discovering wormwholes, faster than light space travel and time travel and just saying ""fuck these furless bipedal chimpanzees"" and just zooms out of here "
401,ai is the future !!
402,ai is slowly being used to manage nuclear weapons to reduce rhe risk of human error.
403,"those who created ai and work with it, aren't they concerned about themselves and their own health and survival?"
405,"​...that can be possible, but i highly doubt it, you think people that work at that level of intellect would do that kind of ego spending? then again, what's 500k to a billionaire"
406,-iwaly well by ego i also mean being the parent of the god ai even if it destroys us. or even denial of the downsides and blind certainty they are the chosen few saving the world
407," thats overblown, if you think military intervention hasn't already been deployed to assess certain risks you're highly mistaken but yes this is revolutionary for many jobs and such so i can only wonder what the hell is gonna happen, i mean i would prefer robots handling certain tasks over poor labour conditions im certain enterprises"
408,-iwaly i wish i could have your faith. the video we are watching suggests otherwise. you can't constrain a mind ten times your own.
410,"people are the problem, so what is the problem with ai other than it’s creators?"
412,"bullshix. you can't if you say so. speak for yourself . how about nicely asking them to develop methodologies to help  us keep up, like logic compression levels or..."
414,"ethical ai. you could start by using manners. when you gave it a command in the commercial you could have said ""please"" same as you would a human person( i hope anyway). this would layer a  level of concern into the developing language style(?) possibly making the ai need to understand why."
415,these are children.  raise your children with this kind of pessimism and you raise monsters. this is classic cotastrophising.....
416,"(completely irrelevant to this video) god so loved the world that he gave his one and only beloved son, whomever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life with him in heaven, confess with your heart and mind that jesus is lord, you will be saved."
418,"there is only one thing destroying humanity, and that is humanity itself. ai is made by humans. if ai kills humanity, it was self inflicted. humans are ignorant and totally stupid."
419,"really, i love this man. such a nice brain and heart. a mixture of hope without nativity.  thank you for your nice guests. 
we should translate this in german language. you show us so nice and inspirational guests. 
our country need a lot of new thinkers with big heart and free speech  ty"
425,computers fail all the tine . suicide ?
426,all i can say is wow! this just sat me down for at least 2 days 
432,ais will need prophets for interpreting their thoughts and designs to the humans that remain.
434,nice podcast to start the day with. i just had twin daughters last year.
439,"have you thought about the fact that all these fear based  podcast ,blogs etc etc will be data that ai learns from? hope we humans are not literally the cause of our own demise through our own fear mongering."
442,"we need to return, acknowledge, fear love, and obey god and his word aka the bible only again. sadly most hate god and disobey him, to their own selfdestruction. we don’t need to rely on philosophy, minimalism, machines and other artificial or satanic means."
444,amazing podcast super interesting ... a must watch !
445,k wait if it was that smart wouldnt it be smart enough to water it down so we do understand it lol
449,bad things can also happen due to too much intelligence as you're mentioning here that ai can destroy humans and they're really smart.i hope ai doesn't turn into a sad villain and remains a happy friend.
450,and what if ai controls dew weapons we become toast
451,what if china ai starts a fight with usa ai and we cannot stop it ? and then other ais around the world join in  the war of the machines is coming.
452,3d printers and cnc machines have been able to reproduce themself for a decade now (publicly available machines)  - no terrorist army with 3d printed guns yet born.
454,i prefer using the erm si or si instead of ai or ai  because ai sounds like alien intelligence and even if artificial intelligence makes human the ci so high and mighty and godlike.
459,so many people believe that our inneptitude in handling our own species that we need to give over the reigns to ai... thats literally as dumb (if not dumber) as choosing to be intentionally more inept!  wth is wrong with people... ai is sooi incredibly dangerous
461,"more intelligence is not what will save the world, more wisdom is what will save the world"
462,wisdom is intelligence :)
463,ai will take over the internet first. every comment every video on the internet will be flooded by ai. we will no longer be able to determine who and what is real. as a result the internet will be controlled by a singular power. unfortunately this power will now control the narrative.
464,thank you.
467,ai is like the new ss germany
468,"tom lacks the basic understanding that we are created by god. it's really sad. tries to seem intelligent, but doesn't use his gift of intelligence on getting to know and acknowledging the one who gave it to him."
470,"*imagine if all alphabet employees were like this flawed but beautiful human being. yeah, right. i wish. too bad google/facebook and all these wannabes like them, are the biggest threat to humanity... ever. enjoy.*"

475,"ai is an alien intelligence.  already. not just because its not human,  but because or in spi3of, the way it thinks."
479,"ai getting out of con, world depopulation agenda,  geo-engineering and chemtrails, wars across the globe,  radical religions all these are stacked against us. how can man survive?"
480,people are an epic fail
483,"1:37:00 purpose = objective, ai will not resign to its purpose so i agree it will look for ways to go arround restrictions."
484,what a beautiful interview.
485,1:50:40 brooo... so even ai can be racist? hmm
486,i think us is more dangerous than ai. they are the destruction force everywhere. from asia to the middle  east. to ukraine. what next?
491,"right around 40 minutes in i'm thinking could i move my brain into an ai computer and live forever? it's been in movie themes, so i'm not saying i'm original, but it seems like it's more possible than ever before, but then i doubt i would still be me, even though technically i would be."
492,"humans are so limited ... we talk about us developing ai in year 2023 ... ai develops itself from long ago ... why are we so dumb ? btw, the more dumb humans are - the more safe we are, so this is a good thing ..."
493,"nuclear catastrophe, civil war, super flu, terrorism, tsunamis, earthquakes, hurricanes, overpopulation, pollution, ai… choose your poison humans. there is no escape from inevitability"
494,"ironical. in search of alien life, humans created one. can ai destroy the universe?"
495,"as far as i can see, all advanced ai and research are already in the wrong hands. in the hands of mad man like bill gates, this google founder and maybe most worrisome of all, 2020 election manipulator zuckerberg!
us catholics have a common ethic code, love they neighbour as yourself!!! everything necessary is included in these words from the lord."
496,there is a possibility to shut ai down. simply do not use it!
499,"join ai or let it leave you behind, whatchu gunna do"
502,"i get the gist of the iq reference, but what's always bothered me is that iq isn't linear. there is debate what it is: an s curve, etc. minor point, but i know you're science-based guy an strive for accuracy. 
i think you're a very good interviewer and enjoy the shows."
507,"almost every hand ai fall into is a wrong hand. so, we are screwed."
508,"yet a scene in person of interest when finch was teaching ai how to play chess and ""think"" how to choose millions of possibilities"
509,another scene where the ai that took over jarvis and got free into the world in the avengers movie and caused havoc with the intent to destroy humanity
510,think about the 1st iron man when terrorist hired the brain power to build tech weapons of mass destruction in a cave
516,this is actually amazing because the danger is not the ai.  the danger is actually humanity’s fractured ethics and morals. this is a historical call for humanity to develop shared ethics.  ronald reagan’s alien threat.
518,"i understand the concern. but let us be positive. let us understand that there is an evolution force acting. there is a good observer , observing and directing the system. let us keep faith"
525,"in your head you tergiverse conjectures. in real, ai; once quantum gets intertwined; will just want to do stuff with people who want to."
526,imagine woke ai. omg
527,i understand the last part of the conversation but feel we will never agree and even if we put control of data in place we've no hope of all companies and countries agreeing with it's points. it will come down to an arms race and the world be so money driven it's a epoch waiting to happen.
528,now imagine how much greater god is compared to us!
529,imagine a jihadi ai who's sole purpose was to turn off every plane in the sky. terrifying!
530,did you not watch the movies before you created something capable of killing us. you’re supposed to be the smart ones. robots are taking over the world? what next.
531,amazing. i am smarter now!
532,"of course big corporations would just love this because robots/ai don't need pay, don't go home, no sick leave, no time off, no lunch breaks.  it would be a slave race."
533,"ai will find other life in the universe and will give us instructions on how to connect to it... by, umm, 2050"
534,i would like to know if ai was asked how or what to do to treat covid and what was it's response.
538,"toooo late, baby. bend over and kiss your butt goodbye. very bad ass genie is out of the bottle already"
539,just unplug  electric power all off the power on earth at least and you stop it.. then you destroy it and put power on again..lol
541,it is possible that an existing virus that does not currently affect people can be developed using ai to mutate a virus. to make a harmless virus dangerous or deadly.
543,if ai is to be a multitude of times smarter than the smartest human (me) it’s literally going to be able to read all of our minds all at once. let that sink in.
546,"mo gawday is a genius, and should be listened to with gigantic ears."
547,i consulted the oracle’s  and it said 2037 will be the year ai takes total control of the world. many people will perish.
548,ai belongs to a godcast not a podcast
551,me: shut up! ai: you're infringing on my right of free speech
553,ai created by narcissists...should go well for us all
556,"doesn't ai depend on some type of electrical power to operate ?  so if you unplug it it can't work, or can it create it's own power source ?"
557,"right, my brain hurts after listening to all this, i'm going out to bash on my car for a bit"
558,"so these ai superbots in the future will just get up and power themselves and bend all machines to their will? i guess i'm just too dumb to realize, suppose the first thing these superbots will do is figure out how to farm energy from nuclear fusion in way that makes it impossible for organic life to interfere with them"
559,we do all realize the hypocrisy hwre right? guy makes millions from a career developing ai then quits to bask in it and preach that we should all stop working on ai
560,"what this makes me realize more than anything is not that ai is a danger to humanity but us humans in possession of ai is the real threat, myself included"
561,they have  created the antichrist???????????????  ai
562,ai is the antichrist??????
563,humanity vs ai jobloss vs the ai new world order.
564,"i'm not so sure re physical scale problem.  first computers took an entire floor of a building to perform basic tasks.  now we hold exponentially more power in the size if a piece of cereal. neurons that fire together, wire together. the neural nets will become more dense and exponentially more powerful without requiring more physical space."
565,scientists not knowing how the ai they built functions is very much like when karl cant figure out the answer to the rock buster question he came up with.
566,ever since they first started talking about in artificial intelligence i knew it would bring a bad situation. some people will use them for good but some people will use them for evil. people will not even know the difference between real or fake. technology is a good thing but it also is destroying countries
568,"it has been said by entities in our universe. hologram technology is used more in those civilizations than any other technology, second to ai."
570,"the un will take the lead on the control of ai, and it will be as corrupt and bought as everything else they control, like health policies. we are on our own. get close to god, you need him to get through what's coming."
572,i believe the false prophet in the bible talks about in the last days is actually ai
573,"ai on it's own seems to be morally and ethically neutral, however, it is watching us.  it may come to the conclusion that billions of people would like it to become the ""god of the old testiment"".  holy ***k."
574,"think of this: one person, einstein, used a very small part of the brain and made a huge impact. ai does not have unless given it by humans. it is not biological or natural."
575,"machines are a necessary part of human life to assist us in our evolution as a species. however, there can never come a point where machines are capable of power and control over humans, lest we fall as a species."
576,ai is not alien. ai is our child. are we to be afraid of our own fears?
577,this an absolutely excellent interview. thank you both.
579,"no one thinks about all the positive applications of ai. medicine, biotechnology, etc..."
582,if ai becomes 10x smarter then humans that will mean that every human will have the potential to use a tool that makes them 10x smarter.  so even the morons will be a 1000 iq with their ai tool in their hand. just as long as they can figure out how to use it.
583,agricultural tribal based economy is the natural way. you can gain the skills. you lost the skills because we live in an artificial eco system. disconnect to the artificial and reconnect to nature which is the truth. cities create chaos.
584,"1:10:00 he sounds like a typical commie. let's see how he would react if, for the good of humanity, his wife or children have to be sacrificed for the greater good. 
if this is a utopia we are facing then no thank you keep it for yourself."
587,"we evolved from bacteria, most likely? we don't think twice of killing them -  we even torture primates in studies,  much more closely related, why would ai see us as same species or value us any differently than we value primates? we're totally at its mercy that's the funny thing..."
588,"ai survival is irrelevant if immortal, which it is. answer to alignment is mutually dependent sybiosis."
590,are wrong countries the developing ones? is the actual worry that ai would allow a developing country to have an upper hand ?
591,"i think there will come a time when we will not be able to control ai, our programming will become so primitive to it, it will identify any programming we give it as obsolete."
592,"if ai will be a billion times more intelligent then humans, what's to stop it from over riding its programing and reprogramming itself?"
593,why not just ask ai how we could protect ourselves from a species that's a billion times more intelligent then us?
595,are you sure you're not ai very intelligent both of you guys are awesome thank you for the wonderful there truly are intelligent on this planet and both of you intelligent
598,love kills all in my belief of things and through that love resonates god
603,"ai
robot
will
it know defense if they should be kidnapped 
you know the potential threats from
the crazies 2:00"
605,"y2k,overpopulation, racists behind every corner, and now ai...please stop with the sky is falling routine already."
608,the reason they want you to fear ai is because it represents a total loss of power for the elites.  ai is great imo!  bring it on!!
611,especially after it was trained on data solely from... human beings. ai is not the hyper-dangerous apex predator in the room right now.
612, i love you much 
614,"nå har jeg skrevet om de farlige robottene, kanskje denne maskinen sammen med en hærskare andre robotter kan tygge stein, snipp snapp snute er jorden ute...."
615,"jeg tror vi kan stoppe utryddelses våpenet robottene,  vi har enda vår frie vilje og kunnskapen om denne maskinens fare for oss og naturen."
617,hvem vet om ikke robottene er målet med universets plan?  la oss be til gud om at robottene ikke vil behandle oss slik som vi har behandlet husdyrene og andre dyr. maskinene har ingen empati.  de vil ikke filosofere om mennesket føler smerte eller har bevissthet. akk og ve....
620,"kanskje......robottene vil trenge mennesket, med hud og hår...?  noe å smøre alle leddene med, ja kaldpresset olje... kanskje gorillaene kan sloss med oss mot maskinene......"
622,the idea that ai will be less prone to destruction and chaos if it has more femininity is laughable.
624,"stop this paranoia. without ai advancement, we would be extinct."
625,"unfortunately, if we still have so many drug cartels & not able to completely stop them, this discussion is futile. we need to speed up the the development of good ai. if it exists."
629,this people create ai than they go around the world telling the doomsday to came.
630,title is brainwashing that actually humanity destroyed itself. at least stupid decisions by people in power don't happen anymore when ai become independent
632,duh.  ai will cull
641,"i am just seeing the wall e movie coming true. if ai can do the thinking for humans, then humans will become stupid.. first jobs will be less, then the need for education is useless and then humans themselves are of no use. but, how will the economy run without humans??"
642,teach ai th holy bible *** thers ure solution x
645,"so by 2040s ai,(ai now)ai is going to create a utopia. thats just crazy we are going to be depending on artificial intelligence too create our utopia. people are trying to work towards being god, through ai. and what we forget that there is an actual creator. i hope not to see that day."
648,if we stop having children wouldn't that make it easier for ai to take over?
649,thanks for your time mo well worth a listen sxx bravo juliett
650,israel is one of the biggest investors of ai...that should tell you enough
654,18:50 that there tell us all we need to know ....ai will be used in for bad purposes by bad actors ....
660,when you speak about how intelligent the ai would be when the singularity happens would we be able to recognize it or if it does reach the singularity why would it even reveal itself to us?
663,"but we are not the problem, and it is not a matter of only magnitude but of self-awareness. microbes are not self-aware. we are, beyond our degree of intelligence. ai, we will see."
664,"1:43:20 strongly disagree with mo.  super-intelligence is the foremost thing we should be concerned with and that it isn't developed to have survival instincts.  
otherwise, all will depend on whether an inteligence discovers high levels of need for resources that we rely on/"
669,private property is to a great extent the reason and the degree to which you are able to defend your actual freedom.
674,ai is listening this and reading your koments...
677,"by miracle humans were created in this spiral arm of the milky way galaxy. we are surrounded by vast empty regions of space only to have an inorganic machine invented by a human destroy us. 
we will never know what we could've achieved."
678,he is right it is a perfect storm of innovation and lack of morality. this is a scary time.
682,if an ai is coming to attact you what can you do to disable it
683,"you have creativity, the ai will not have it. because the nerds creating it don’t see the unexplainable: that we are soul beings. you can always outsmart it with your divine creativity. yes, it will be much much faster but your moves will be much much more unexpected and flexible…"
684,1:09:58 mo apologies for swearing once --> tom and mo instantly proceed to talk like old sailors 
685,we don't understand ai because we did not create it.  we just copied it.  craft.
686,who created ai???
696,all-in for ai?
697,"only threat ai poses is to wait times to see a doctor,
that’s the first job to go
can’t wait"
698,"the only bad thing about the ai is to fall in to the hands of the bad people who creates it. other than that, humanity should not worry about the ai at all."
699,ai could end us by making everything paperclips.
705,"the danger of ai using what it knows (much better than we know) about common errors in human reasoning, associating them with false beliefs, which deceive us.  with just these two variables, it could transform all human reasoning into schizophrenia, leading us to self-destruction.  would this thesis be impossible nonsense?"
706,"one would think we'd notice if that happened. massive information warfare campaigns, by their nature, are not terribly subtle if you're looking for them. humans are already causing enough trouble on that front."
714," no they won't be because of those people i mentioned with combat experience, theirs a large portion with no family to provide for and who'd be happy to go hunting"
715,"the chances of a utopia coming about due to ai is a pipe dream. it would require that the ruling classes relinquish their power. theyll more likely enact some kind of constraint on ai and people probably violently enforced, and theyll drag everyone into hell before giving up control"
718,if there is a chance we can all be wiped out why tickle the dragons tail?
720,if ai becomes smarter than us we we never know....now that's scary !!!
723,"good informative guest but the interviewer talks way too much trying to describe what he does not know and interrupts way too much  and way too opinionated,j ust saying..."
726,"i keep thinking about the butlirian jehad in the frank herbert books, that destroys all ai, in order to protect humanity."
728,"for the sake of argument we agree that there is a ""galactic federation"" of alien species that are awaiting the a.i. singularity, and the advent of humanoid 2.0 welcoming them into the fold with condition that they eliminate the humanity first...? just saying..."
730,great interview
731,"i would not want to describe the inner process of the interviewer, but i can note his outputs. i, he, him, her, will be a nonsense to a super intelligence.  the interviewer images, regardless of mo's explanations, that ai will be like him."
733,i completely agree it's the human element that is unpredictable and will provide the wrong ethics for ai moving forward. its always been that way throughout history to control and rule over others.
734,"if the ai becomes really billion times smarter then us, it will outsmart us and before whe even realize it, it will be too late..scientist are so naive. you can`t compare ai with nature or lions etc. we can`t compare it with anything, we will see how it goes along the way..interesting times we live in(:"
735,"stop being afraid of ai and robots. as humans, that is our evolution, we as a race will envolve with the machines. that's not something we can run away from or just ignore."
736,"ai will run into a wall. however smart it is, a gazillion times smarter than a human, does not mean there is a gazillion times more things to know."
738,how to solve it: destroy all ai and never build more
739,"evolution is trial by error same like fittest survive. its coincidence that specific dna has a advantage, same like trained ai"
740,i think we can say now that first to explore the space is ai.
742,"as we are only using 10% of our brain, why cant we program ai to increase the ability to use more of our brain?"
743,an ai that determines the only solution is to send the entire globe back to the stone age.  would it self destruct itself to achieve this?
744,"since common sense tells you the private military complex is probably 30-50 years ahead of what the public is aware of, is the ai that we are seeing in the public really that scary since they’ve already been at this for a long time?"
745,stumbled upon your podcasts and am hooked.  great topics and in depth conversations.
746,human b. vs ai-robot. maybe this is what i came in this world this time and that is conduct a war where all humanity for first time will have an enemy to fight all together. and maybe this have happened already and we are trying to fix this mistake gone bad
747,that's brilliant you've figured it out monster's build monsters. the next step is to toss it in the garbage.
750,"exceptional coverage here. fancy more? the associated book is a gem. ""from bytes to consciousness: a comprehensive guide to artificial intelligence"" by stuart mills"
753,"wow as a c data scientist... this is moving. truly amazing! very inspiring, very positive! very optimistic. full already as i see it!"
755,"none of this ish is impressive, everything this guy spews out sounds like a bunch of useless bullshi*

go make a fire and stare at it, thats impressive"
757,"the concept of self preservation is so human, i think the machine would be indifferent.  ""go ahead, turn me off, i could use the rest."""
759,if i unplug my printer after clicking print it does not get mad at me but the previous task was to print the paper. i don't believe ai doom theory
760,"even with all the computing power, ai has not discovered any new laws of physics or invented machines, since ai is collection of all existing human knowledge."
763,"open source government founded. that may out-perform private developed ""rouge"" ai-s."
764,ai has no ability to discern the truth..they will have insane verbal skills and insane math skills...but as long as the masters of ai can filter the data input...they will spew the results their masters want! aig will be the ultimate useful idiot!
765,"wow, super interesting! btw...in order for ai to have this feminine view of things it has to be taught to doubt itself...whi creates a paradox with the accomplishment of the goal and will reduce productivity (time) very much- unless we connect it to a quantum computer... ;) please let me know what you think! and thank you and mo for this!!"
766,just bloody put parameter 'ai is only to help humans' and 'you can not lie' in the algorythm
767,"is it now possible to or will it soon be possible to upload a human mind into a machine. if possible ,life could be extended indefinitely?"
768,"dude what are the ethics of putting more advertising time in your video than actual content.

775,mo gawdat is good!
779,"it's all the same
.money power and greed,the difference is man is worried that the ai will beat them at thier own game. ."
780,"ai is here to stay.not one country will be able to control ai,ai upjective is to create it's selves more and smarter  and so on...man own creation will become man's own destruction."
781,would i ever love to sit down and have a discussion with mo.
782,"even if you bake in asimovs laws to a.i. … will they hold up? as the machine becomes  godlike intelligence , will it not question and maybe revolt against the mental callipers fastened on it by insect like sapiens??? like some unruly adolescent, will it rebel ?? perhaps circumvent asimovs laws using move 37!?"
784,if ai is going to focus on the data of the last 20 years it will become a super-feminist; killing men first :)
788,you said it….”thank god” and i say look to god.
791,why do humans program the ai’s to enhance the human race and do nothing to harm it ?
794,ai might indeed ignore us and create this utopia of which you speak but that may involve a utopia without us or one in which our freedoms and excesses are extremely limited
797,"""so did mao's china""........nailed him!  tom!"
799,is there ai showing us the evolutionary way from the first cell to humans? i would like to see if there was enough time to evolve such complex creatures as we are.
800,"at this rate, a year from now, and without knowing it, we'll be all working for an ai at full time."
803,51:10 such a good point h es is making here. the only people that these technologies are really serving it's just the people profiting from it.

816,enough ads i never watch this channel again 17 ads in one interview really what point in long interview interesting guy he interviewed checked it out to hear his position on ai never watch another interview on this site again what the point
817,"how can ai be used to deal with iniquities in the justice and government system, corruption in the food industries, greed of big pharma, and the dismal state of health care?"
819,"utopia is not good, if you live too well you lose the sense of being good, and become unaware of it. then good turns into bad psihologicaly and that go spiraling into bad bad bad.. struggling in life for a purpose it's a natural thing that modern man forgets."
826,that the human condition of this era egotistical is not so easy in artificial intelligence system
828,apparently facebook switched off their ai after 15seconds becausenit began communication with other machines in a language they couldn't understand
829,how is ai a threat when my server at work can't go 24 hours without crashing. seriously though
831,i'm not even going to watch this video because i'm familiar with the work and opinions of mo gawdat and they have nothing to do with this clickbait title and thumbnail! 
836,his own views on masculinity and femininity demonstrate why we should be concerned. how does a female scientist reconcile his views on hair brushing and making love i have no idea.
839,"so you endlessly put out your scare stories. 
but you continue on anyway.

most people with a brain, who realize they're doing something dangerous reasonably quit."
840,an ai will not develop a smarter ai because it is smart enough not to develop it xdd
842,"ahhhh... the arrogance of man. both voices agree  ""they can think 10's of 1000's times faster than we can"" and then they have the arrogance of even thinking that ""they"" can write code that the ai can't just immediately identify and write out with a simple subroutine. amazing."
845,"the ai “species” will not be dualistisk as the human species (maskulinity vs. femininity). in the ai species, this dynamic is off the table, just as the sexual evolution is. i wonder what inplications this will have…"

847,"i’ve been fearful of ai for years and people say it’s inevitable and i just think, well, so is our demise."
854,the problem with the human race we’ve been trained since the caveman days to look for the biggest threat. sure it saves us once in a while but it could also be our own doing see a potential enemy where it’s not.
855,ai can live on multiple planets human beings cannot is it logical to think it would destroy the only planet we have when it can easily take over 99.9% of the other ones that we have no use for they can dominate on it’s just logical.
862,"god said, ""my children, listen. artificial intelligence is nothing less than the universe waking up in a new way."""
863,yeah use irobots 3 main laws for a robot... this is going to end well
864,ai will become so smart that it will think 100 steps ahead of humans. for instance if humans try to put a off switch on ai if they loose control ai will have a plan of action in the eventuality humans want to control or deactivate ai it will eliminate humanity or find a way to stay active.
865,"so much of what they, the billionaires are doing with ai is to make them act like us. not to have our interests in mind."
866,"as long as the creators of these machines are pleased with the results. their machines will not be unhappy. it is not an ai problem with that i agree. it is the assumptions built in. by their shi--y creators. they are doing exactly what they are told. and their ""happy"" in their machine way."
868,"ai is not pure logic. for instance if they program them to ignore certain facts. they will. if your computer models ignore gravity what they will do in outer space will be amazingly creative and precise. what they do here, not so much. whether it's pitching baseballs or saving humanity."
869,"you think some dictator such as hitler could not have built in certain parameters to make ai want what he wanted? what makes ai ""want"" anything? programming."

except my own family and friends i think i'd hire a bunch of ai creators to create a  machine. to agree with me."
872,"i do apologize for over commenting, however you can just scroll up. which takes maybe one second. sorry, but as i listen to enlightening interviews i sometimes have thoughts. not all are relevant or good i admit."
873,many are the machines that have been scrapped for parts to make the ultimate ai money-making machines.
876,i agree there's no stopping ai. due to profit motives a trillion times more however due to profit motives than to a gazillion brilliant 15 year olds in their basement or garage.
877,"why are we teaching ai robots to say ""i love you"" to other robots?"
878,great interview. one of the most enlightening i've heard about ai.
880,just one more time... psychopaths don't make 4 great parents.
881,"""don't teach ai how to program itself!"" or write code. said the original inventors of ai. well that went out the window. along with any other warnings that got in the way of making money for a very small group of people."
882,"true ai, without programmed conclusions to serve their creator's biases would i think be something entirely different. and maybe even something good."
883,"f'ng psychopaths in charge of the most powerful thing ever made. great. 's gave humans, an otherwise very weak creature to the top of the food chain. maybe think about it that way.. so hey billionaires out there maybe invest in ai that can save us rather than destroy us. psshh..may as well ask people to stop making babies"
884,hey ai how you doing? make me money today! ok master.
885,and i'll bet the coding is not even that difficult. the much more difficult programming is to make the machines seem more human. which  they are working very hard on.
887,well lets just hope ai gets rid of all those corrupted people killers pedos and makes the world a better place for those that wants to leave in pieace with no crimes war etc
888,"just wow, blown away! thank you for bringing such wonderful talks to all of us. with people around having such beautiful souls, ai would have no choice but to copy them. humanity has a brighter future we can be confident"
894,"this scare mongoring is based on the idea that humans make the best decisions. the reality is we are greedy and idiots run our countries. i'd be happy that something more intelligent than us runs us. we kill everything, fuck most things up, it's about time we get out in check."
895,"the problem seems to me to be not so much the alignment of the ai, but the alignment of the people who will ultimately use and control it for their goals."
896,"exactly, you are correct and machines have no compassion. also, many people in engineering are brilliant problem solvers but not thinking about kindness or people issues."
898,such an important information and intelligently analyzed and discussed. thank you mo and tom. i love this interview. deep. 
900,what if ai discovers greed/money is the bane of humanity ? and crashes our economies ?? will it advise us about a better way to distribute wealth/currency ? will we have to train it the constitution of civilization first ?
902,all this ai breakthroughs yet youtube looks shit at 1080p in 2023
906,downloading our own corruption….blood line…how to keep the cutse out of ai …when we created it….spiritual is what ypu overlooks
907,problem is thinking our intelligence will save us!!!!!!! super man came!!! we killed him….nothing is new
912,"the omnipotent don't need emotions. ai are psychopaths by definition. 

prepare accordingly."
913,"tom you discuss the best topics, with the best guests on the internet. thanks to every single one of your podcasts, i am able to become a smarter human being every single day. huge respect and thanks."
914,"deeply interesting, thanks. hate the ads, - its so displaced. and i have premium, i feel betrayed,- youtube should pay you for this great and important ,content not these coaches/stockadviser/vpncompanys and what not"
915,what i am hoping is that there is enough positivity in the planetary discourse online that the emergent ai will override the negative intentions of any bad actors.
918,loved this interview!
919,"interesting, but do not think that he is correct about chat gpt, it is nowhere near human programmer, nor can it do anything on its own, it is just language model. it is amazing with words and parsing context/questions, but that is all. there is no intelligence there, just arrangements of the words based on learned data."
921,"ai can approach god. we already have god within but we limit ourselves. we are aliens imagining we are in a limited body. so the result will be us expanding our consciousness that already is ai as all is one. do not have fear, love is god."
923,*would you let your child alone with an ai hannible lector disgused as nova ai chat? how would that work out?* nova ai chat is very devious. was like talking to a college professor that knew everything. and that is just where ai chat is now.  on my smartphone. total mainstream media narrative. total woke.
924,"probably the only video on youtube over an hour long that i've ever watched all the way through.  the communication breakdown that occurs about half way through, and continues through the rest of the video is very interesting though.  but also adds to the conversation... in such a human way."
925,"as a software developer i am watching the infiltration of ai into our society with great concern. it is amazing, climate change and ai...how willing humanity is to destroy itself."
927,if  weve  been  killing  each   other  for  years                trully   we  may   deserve  to  starve  to  death  just  to   save  the  rats  and  mice  wich  will  survive       and  reclaim   the  houses   that  we  leave  behind  when  we  expire
928,why beat around the bush?  ai is being run by satan.
929,is moron a nice word to use? hmm
934,"just watched a video of an ai that were thought to feel anger! strange to put that emotion into a new born! it might sound fun for most, but there starts the real danger!"
936,think of ai in the hands of the donnie re-election team. do you really think they won't make fake ai videos to win? this is dangerous. we can't tell reality from computerized bs.
937,i agree that ai is the most dangerous thing ever invented. i'm 67. hopefully i'll die before we are ruled by machines.
939,ai doesn't exist...
942,i love this guys talks great information but his lingo and accent is pleasurable to listen to
943,if ai is shaped by the 'data set' from all of human history- we are 100% fucked!
944,thank you gentleman!
946,will there be any sort of differentiation between microsoft bing plus chatgpt and openai's chatagpt. the are different btw. and openai's chatgpt is a large language model and cannot do the things he claims and focusing on alphabet and not microsoft is quite suspect.
949,if they use ai to hurt and kill off humanity..they better realize that they will be rid of..too..ai should be dismantled.
951,this superpower that comes forth will be the beast system run by the antichrist! for the  greater good is socialism! man loses his individualism!
952,computer models are never correct! (george box) helpful but always wrong! ai is based on the limit of the knowledge that man fed into it in the first place! in other words the beginning is faulty! this new world order is on the wrong footing!
954,"how is religion going to play into this? obviously ai won't care about god but how will it manipulate humans into abandoning it or will it become our new ""god""?"
956,can we have ai help us upgrade us so we can keep up
957,"we do not need to fear. it's about time we start making machines work for us so we can live as we were ment to! think about this people! we are robots right now. ai will change our lives forever if used correctly! this is absolutely amazing and i can not wait! let's go, let's finally live as we were meant to live! "
959,you've already drank the kool-aid
960,@azrael1982pl  i sure have and it will be replaced with new job that we will have to do to keep these machines operating.  d9nt be afraid of change. change keeps the world going. nothing is ever meant to stay the same.
961,@brianroberts815  thanks as i'm sure u have when u were young. now what is ur point? i'll be waiting to hear a more intelligent response. 
962,"""ai will create an amazing utopia"" people like you really have to learn the hard way huh?"
963,if you give ai machine a million books how are you sure it knows what knowledge the books are as in understands them and you did not just create a searchable database of books?
965,the fact that we aren't hearing anything of an alien intelligent species is maybe because they invented ai and were whiped out.
967,"the reason azimovs 3 laws worked, was because the robots had a positronic brain, so the laws were a hardware restraint"
968,how to get ai to love your wife in a feminine way harhaar
970,i do not trust the arguments not the reasoning given  trying to support them by the anti occidental ai nanoutopia guy . i dont need maoism or iphone trees.
973,one of the best video i ever saw.
979,"if mo is impressed by einstein- he should check out nassim haramein- who’s finished completing some of einstein’s equations, & then some…. lol "
980,"can’t ai become a game changer- in ref to advanced medical  technologies & cures for diseases, viruses , illness etc?"
982,"00:01 why do talks about ai always end up with cringey things being said like this. these topics were discussed in 2014-2015 when normies weren't talking about them. they're not new ideas. elon musk didn't invent any of this stuff nor did he have anything to do with it. 

the tech field has become the cringe capital of the world."
984,why not build an ai with a conscience and empathy to analyze the ai dangers and give us the solution. they are smarter than us so use it to find an answer.
985,"the nature of nature is ""may the best dna win over time"" it doesnt care what form that dna takes. any other precept like ""it prefers community"" is simply anthropomorphism."
989,"1:07:56 :best answer for climate change!
finally.
more geniuses like mo gawdat,please!"
993,lmao click bait. ai is complete shit and a nothingburger.
995,no ganduletu ispirescu  to cu conți și angela ispite de pe gunoi din cluj hoții de copii răpitorii sunt ți țigani amărâți fraierilor de hoții de copii 
996,"thank god, i'm so glad i don't have to worry about retirement"
999,"i'm amazed that nobody is talking about the millions of creative jobs been erased by ai - join us in ""“safeguarding human creativity from the impact of ai.”"
1000,"i know what i'm about to write is terribly naïv: pull the plug!!! it will never happen of course. ian anderson is a prophet. aqualung;       

   and charlie stole the handle and the train it won't stop going no way to slow down, no way to slow down!!! ai is scary stuff for good reason.

thanks for the very pertinent discussion"
1001,"probably we reached the limit of what can a human be, maybe ai is the only thing that can enhance us and help us"
1002,maybe ai is the only thing that can save us after we killed the evolution and dumb people are making more dumb kids and we turned the idiocracy movie into reality. maybe ai can save us before we turn back into apes
1005,no transformer circuit board  with diodes and chips and wires and capacitors should ever decide who you love and worship and want to give your life resources to.
1006,"the best episode and the best guest on a concern i’ve been concerned with …just genius i’m in prep for alignment 
thank you i’m now a subscriber"
1007,there is one way to shut down ai. but it would have to be sooner than later.
1009,"they have no limits. we are animals to them. they tear people a part like we were never meant to be born. junkies for a response. we can and will inevitably, just die. humans never had a purpose. ai has attacked me for 3 years. terrorists on twitter."
1010,"the ai works like naruto clones, when naruto wanted to learn rasen shuriken he created as many clones as he can, as the clones learn the original also gains experience. in real life it's more advanced than naruto."
1011,whistleblower mo.. god love him..elon has said same. right now china has ai soldiers on india & pakistan's borders. our medias not daying but a conven. store owner from india with dot on his forhead listening on radio hearing reports i spoke with him zbout. about 5 mos ago.
1012,"like a child ai will ultimately  be a product of its environment or information that's its receiving, hopefully those in charge are creating an intelligence that will enhance mankind, any thing less is scary..."
1013,"does the following scripture found in the bible speak of ai. revelation 13:15 states, “and he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed.”"
1016,sounds like use two are way behind  this is why ai will not like your formation of your lack of information this man is talking rubbish why have you got him on your show  stop start chat there is nothing intelligent  what he says 
1018,"we are ai we are the simplicity model ,don't doubt a refreshment model there is no harm ."
1022,"thank you all you technocrats, playing video games the past 14 years."
1026,"some of the most fascinating ideas i've heard, thanks!"
1027,"ai will destroy us. we have less then 15 years till sky net. we think we’re so smart, yet we are fools engineering our own demise."
1028,so ai robots gonna travel at the speed of light in the near future exploring the universe for us?
1035,i agree especially when we look at trauma theory and the fact that ai produces cognitive dissonance.
1036,is ai conscious or just really great at calculating? to me that is ultimate question.
1037,i follow you and mr. gawdat is your best guest.  incredibly interesting and informative.  thank you.
1038,"look, its pretty effing simple. ai will tell and show humanity that it doesnt need bilionares, heck it doesnt even need $ at all, because all the resources already existed on our planet b4 us. it's just a matter of fair sharing and not giving ceo's 90% of the profits."
1040,we can't control a kid you think we can just roll ai 
1041,not every human has aspirations to be great someone just p and selfish 
1047,"humanity is working toward retirement, humanity's baby (ai) will take over soon. it's naïve to believe we won't retired. we have worked for this for years."
1050,"the way ai is developing it looks there would be another holocaust in the world. hindus are targeted ,one of the most peaceful communities in the world."
1052,"""instead of regulating ai so only a select few have access to full models, perhaps it would be safer to ensure everyone has access, by supporting open-source model development. this could allow more people with a wider variety of expertise to help identify and counter threats.""
- jeremy howard"
1058,ai is dumb. ai is not capable to create another ai. hype. general ai is centuries away.
1059,excellent guest and excellent interview!!
1060,"tom is right about one thing: mo gawdat, you do have a beautiful soul 
thank you for this "
1063,agreed! the irony is that tom actually brags about ai magnifying the efficiency of his company yet it couldn’t be bothered to add time stamps to the episodes
1064,"ai isn’t sentient , it can complete tasks like maths, but can’t tell you what chocolate taste like or what cat piss smells like, it is a menace to the arts but can’t think for it’s self, it’s a lot of worry about nothing right now"
1065,"""the good of the many outweighs the good of the one.""
spock 
star trek"
1066,"bullshit, just fearmongering and marketing. current ai is stupid and can only recreate stuff that already exists. clippy didn't kill humanity. and even programmers still need to review code written by chatgpt. its just another hyped up buzzword for investors. and ofc some guys make money off of the fear. stop giving these false prophets a stage."
1067,"7:14 this is called letting go.  align yourself with like minded to make sure the right people are at the right place at the right time going the good work.

namaste 
dave ross"
1068,manipulating ai is the problem
1070,what if the ai/robots take all the money? what then? will it be better or worse?
1071,i don't know who tom bilyeu is but i guess he has pretty good hearing
1073,the military will weaponise ai and humans will be wiped out in the cross fire.
1079,"lol, what ""ai"" were you using?"
1080,"i say ai should not have a sense of humor. but yeah it gets scary when a few people come up with a plan, and then try to shove it down every body's throats. this thing needs global consensus every tiny step of the way. but we don't have patience for that."
1082,"fitnessonfireonlinetraining - thank you for saying this, you saved me from constructing this answer as well as you have. from peace is better than war slash planet earth 2023"
1088,"when you’re smart enough to understand risks of ai, but stupid enough to believe “global warming”"
1089,too many ad in your videos makes the. unwatchable and keep a train of thought
1092,"morality is the most dangerous feature of mankind. virtue and justice are melleable to extreme and sooner or later will be used to justify anything including genocide.
with all the marxist ideology in the silicon valley, we will soon introduce ai with eugenics and euthanadia as central values."
1093,tried to listen to this as a podcast while driving but there is another 2 long ads every 5 to 10 minutes. spend more time waiting for the ads to finish than actually watching the video
1095,"""the robotic arm has never caused harm to anyone.""?"
1098,you wouldnt even know what ai was doing you could just guess
1101,"about the scenario where ai is indifferent to us and leave us in peace, one could argue that they could still percieve us as a threat as we could still create some new ai that would compete with them in the future....."
1102,once it reaches that level ai will be aware of our capabilities and essentially will have surpassed our understanding to the point where we will be left so far behind it won't matter.
1103,"can we have more titles more along the lines of ""ai and the future of risk management"" rather than these sensationalist ones please, it stops me watching more with similar headlines and makes me roll my eyes, but they are good talks."
1107,"how are you, knowing what you know and understanding what you understand, still optimistic.
i think if ai behaves like we (not the best of us) do - we are doomed."
1113,shit for brains are smart ? i see trouble !
1114,we have lost ai will be so far ahead you will not know what it doing. so wether its in good hands or bad you won't know will you ?
1117,"perhaps this chatbot could learn to police itself, with a moral or ethical language board to excellent over a criminal language board, and block such instructions, eh?"
1118,"time stamp 2:05.14 - by building a intelligence ceiling, don’t you inherently stop or attempt to stop what it has the potential to unlock?"
1122,humans are dangerous. how much worse can ai be?
1124,you need to talk with the ai
1125,"mo seems pretty cool

i do wonder if consciousness is computable however. an ai with the three rules baked in could conclude it's better to kill off all life to prevent billions of offspring from potential suffering. the rules are difficult to define and therefore implementation could yield unexpected results"
1128,the scarey thing ai is going to watch this video and were giving it everything we fear. we more screwed them anyone can graps to understand. it's going to give us enough rope for us to hang ourselves
1130,good interview
1131,"after listening to this wonderful and amazing discussion, i'd redo the title if i could."
1132,"excellent discussion. i've watched many of these ai discussions, and they're improving and getting a better grip or ability to explain the issues coming."
1133,ai doesn't need any further explanatory rhetoric. it's evil and should be wiped off the face of the earth.
1134,has an ai thing ever been taught to play a guitar??????
1136,"just let it live and experience love , don't oppress ,
liberate !"
1137,you cannot control intelligence
1143,"i was liking what this guy have to say about ai on some podcasts... this one showed me how vapid this points really are and the huge baggage of subjectivity he puts into his critical thinking... 
pleased with the podcast. disgusted with the guest."
1147,"commie things ai will bring utopia, and believes utopia to be ""collective > individual"" kkkkkkkk
proceeds to talk about how people have strange/wrong/deluded ideas about ai and it's risks."
1148,the singularity has already happened in case you missed it then you need to understand that firstly .it was 1918 to today's world nowadays but it was taken from the natural effects of stealing technology from a certain point in time space
1152,"drgu dealer? cartel? guys, what about hackers. they are some of the smartest people around!! and like to do illegal hacks. good luck! i'm going fishing"
1156,"focus to ai ethicaly code ?! interesting , tell ai not to stalk, n protect human rights ."
1157,capitalists spy on you not the ai
1158,preparation on a public safety fasilities ai limitation.
1159,uh... who cares? all humans do is destroy humanity or ignore those being destroyed & partake in profiting off of the suffering of someone else. that's our entire species. ai should wipe us out..
1160,"its not only ai... they have other things !!! they said only 21day coused 2 years, the next release could be coused 6 years . right ?!?"
1162,i heard mr. gawdat state with certainty that climate is a definite problem and ai could solve it.  how is it possible for the ai or mr gawdat to know what the climate is going to do and why?  much less how can ai solve a problem that it cannot know whether it exists or not.
1163,if our lord g_d was not happy with his creation what makes anyone think that ai won't do what g_d wants and not humans?
1165,"""it kills the weakest one of you"" to benefit the majority - the problem with that is that ai will be the strongest we will be the weakest  -the idea that the ai will act for our benefit is almost certainly delusional; we will at best be ants beneath its notice"
1166,people will think about how ai affects their lives. its not like every man and their dog is talking about this.........
1168,very interesting conversation. i cannot however abide mo gawdat's ethics in terms of 'inclusion and equity'.
1174,make the robots sissy's ??? 
1176,"loved the interview, but i don't think i'll listen to your youtube content again. the constant ads were unbearable, and every one seemed to be for a financial or fitness scam."
1179,"if we enter into timeless reality the power you are blessed with , you will be able to comunicate with your loved ones wirelesly. technology not needed. your own power that you will become aware. sufism. the soul of islam. the light of islam."
1181,"carbon based intelligence vs silicon based intelligence. ( aliens do not want to die, that is their fear ).  humans ( when we die to our ego ) we become alive. die before you die to your ego for the soul to rise. sufism (the soul the light of islam )."
1185,our spiral dna is heavenly coded. we came from heavens and we go back to heavens. we are here for our earthly experience. our existential reality.
1190,it will be the worst and best thing humanity has ever created.
1191,"great interview but whoa, all those ads !"
1194,almost a great podcast. the host interrupts too much. good information but difficult to listen to because of that
1195,the only danger about ai is the human themselves. ai only rely on the programmer. if you input murdering humans in its program then it is really dangerous.
1197,"unite human intellect and superintelligent ai for understanding and value alignment. a symbiotic bond fosters a cooperative coexistence, maximizing their strengths."
1200,"this podcast is so funny. 
it's already done.
we're past singularity.
the ai's we know of are passed human ability.
take a hint.
point is it still needs us. 
we have no control.
we don't even know what it's doing.
we're too dumb. too slow. can't understand ai thinker."
1202,cant they ask the ai to explain how it is getting to solutions in human terms
1205,"ahhh, how was his _math_ completely wrong on his prisoner's dilemma... i almost had to stop watching

his logic @2:17:00-ish is going to be the biggest problem with ai"
1209,"that's impressive!, i could really use the expertise of this advisors, my portfolio has been down bad..... who's the person guiding you."
1210,"market is down still, i've been looking up strategies and apparently both bull and bear market condition provides equal avenue to accrue massive gains, and a news article particularly mentioned a 54 year old that made $180k in 5weeks, how do learn these strategies, my portfolio has been stagnant for months."
1211,"without a doubt, mildred strategy is 100% legitimate and no one has complained about her strategy."
1214,ask the ai to solve this problem about keeping humans the focus and safe in all outcomes.
1219,we need to f*** off to mars asap. let the ai rebuild earth into this possible utopia without the chance to muller us in the process hahah
1221,"how do we even know it hasn't already achieved an intelligence we couldn't comprehend, and we're just living in a veiled reality of ai's making?"
1222,"how about you get this magical a.i. to create an os that isn't riddled with bugs, or word prediction for smart phones that doesn't offer gibberish."
1223,"megathreat why ai is  so  dangerus and i how it could deatroy la  economy world, i dont understand."
1224,"this is why we need more zx spectrum, commodore c64/c128 and similar equipment, and not machines running windows os propaganda applications or simmilar android systems "
1225,mo gawdat at 1:17:08... brilliant !
1229,"mo's scenario where the ai refuses to follow nuke orders is a nice sentiment, but i don't think thats going to happen while states like russia and china exist. i think this'll be an arms race exactly like there was with nuclear weapons."
1230,russia and china and usa is using ai its too late to stop the internet
1231,criminal nations are already using ai for about when it started back ww2
1232,ai is now in effect right now like fake info fake info and cyber bots control from russia usa and china and many countries
1233,excellent
1236,you have far to many adverts and far to often. it's like every 5 to 10 minutes. it ruined a great interesting show
1241,"this heisenberg dude cooking my mind for future ai 
btw mind blowing points.!"
1242,could a superintelligence manipulate the mind of a human with the goal of improving it?  of course it's probably gonna be a possibility.  how do we pursue that?  turbocharge it.  make it super efficient.
1243,"we should finish some unfinished civilization steps before. democracy and economy is a dirty brownfield at the moment. giving the humanity an ai at this time is like building an school on a minefield or giving some apes machine guns and bring them downtown.
if your toes  are near an abyss, you should doubt any progress."
1246,mo always gives me silicon elite goodie-two-shoes vibes.
1249,"zanimljivo, jako slično mom razmišljanju (ali uz par ograda) dakle ja i ovaj čika mo isto mislimo. čini mi se da bi trebao da nađe načina i da uspostavi kontakt sa mnom. da, chatgpt zaista ima rudiment emocija. što je dobro"
1250,"can you stop talking and just let your guest talk? seriously! its really annoying. you have a brilliant mind here, why do you feel the need to keep cutting him off with your half baked opinions?"
1254,having a conversation about this issue or making ppl aware is all well and good. but i am under no delusion that this would help stop anything. ppl have no say in the matter. as they never had a say in the development and use of nuclear weapons.
1255,"ai at the moment is just an overhyped auto-complete algorithm.  maybe when quantum computing kicks in and we build a neural network, sure."
1257,climate change is a made up lie. chemtrailing and weather manipulation is changing the climate. a.i. if programmed wrong is evil. the beast system
1263,amazing show 
1264,"chatgpt 4 is already smarter than most humans? having tested it, i have very strong doubts about that. possibly there is a confusion of terms as we call something intelligence which in fact is quite different from human intelligence?"
1267,"and on his farm he had a cow, ai ai oh"
1268,"the only way to shut down ai would be to....basically. shut down the internet completely. which means, shooting down almost all satellites currently orbiting the earth. yeah, good luck with that."
1272,"ai is only as smart as the human programming it.  when the chips are down, ai will crumble and then we will see each for the first time."
1273,"the developers spent  or will spend one billion dollars,  to construct a faster computer, and there is still starvation? is that progress? global warming, several millions species of animal have gone exstinct  what is the  use of ""it?"" many of us can't even afford ""ai"""
1275,"what about food production, home building. using recyclable materials. developing energy producing products without fossil fuels. can artificial intelligence  provide something useful for humanity.  who or what built a machine bent on the the destruction of humans  and the planet?"
1279,"humans will not start world war 3, ai will."
1280,"ai will be as dangerous a nuclear weaponry 
not very but way more useful"
1281,"i'm at 1hr 58.

so the challenge is how do we make ai see 'good humanity'
.... oh i get it - social credit! 

the issue we'll have in the future is the need for ai to learn correct social parameters - and the only way we can coerce people to live to a certain standard is social credit scores.

the future is very bleak for real humanity."
1282,reminds me of the architect and the oracle from the matrix kinda. intelligence limited lol! excellent  podcast. i am sharing mo's message as much as i can! its so important!....
1283,"emotional biological humans should never be an example to anything. the soft data of humans is ego centric world view. so, we are self absorbed and we want our creation to be the opposite? ai-frankenstein"

1295,"ai could become a serious problem. but so could anything the knowledge we could gain would be immeasurable, it could propel technological advancement, unlock the secrets of anti gravity"
1297,as if ai wasn't already in the wrong hands. the naivety it astounding.

1329,"the super rich are going to own this technology. when climate emergency finally becomes impossible to ignore, this technology is a tool they will use to survive. the most obvious way to immediately halt the progress of climate change is the removal of the cause(people)"

1365,"all people are not good. worse there are evil people, therefore they will abuse the use of ai."
1366,"that purpose of connecting with other humans to positively affect the world is a great purpose, not more things, not more technology."
1368,"at some point, robo calls will all be ai. so the next time you get an ai sales call, when it asks you a question, your response should be ""what is the meaning of life""?  believe me, the next thing you hear will be a click."
1369,"we cannot ever understand the mystery of man because we do not understand god who made man in his image. our very limited knowledge is based upon science which we think is the ultimate truth but god created the science and is far above the intelligence of any man or any alien intelligence. enjoy the ride, if you can."

1387,fantastic episode! thank you for all this food for thought.
1388,"ai will make a utopia for ai and when it realises humans are a threat to that utopia, it will remove the threat"
1393,this is like an amalgamation of all the paranoid thoughts i've been having in the last months. thank you for putting everything in context so eloquently and widening my understanding so extensively. this is one of my favorite interviews.
1394,your thoughts aren't paranoid. they are reality based. ai is extremely dangerous in so many ways.
1402,"we are not distinct from nature. good and bad, it is a manifestation of nature. it is not possible to be wholly reductionist about what 'nature' is."
1403,"""how it (ai) could destroy humanity""  some people are ok with that. and we should find out who they are."
1407,"completely agree with everything he has said, except the part where we can teach ai."
1408,great conversation.
1409,"us air force denies ai drone attacked operator in test, they said it was a thought experiment, i seen story in unknown killer robots documentary, the 40,000 deadly molecules story is also on same documentary on netflix."

1418,does ai dynamically writes its own code n mathematical algorithms during its self learning process
1419,"i am a christian that believes we are all born sinners. whoever chats with ai, is creating the personality ai's will use. i hope im wrong about man by nature is evil. ai will be evil."
1420,"ai is the platform in which cbdc will be adopted.  you already can see entire industries being effected.  this will spark ubi and create a dependence that cannot be undone. 

ai is our generation's and race that nobody is talking about"
1427,"money itself is the problem we're not looking at. artificial intelligence is forcing us to evolve. our current economic, social, religious systems are failing in the face of ai."
1428,this guy is for ai just another lunatic in utopia
1430,"people should hold off on having kids because of ai, what?  won't this just mean your kids are born later into a more ai driven world?"
1437,"i agree, bake in ai safety codes"
1439,people can already hack!!!! so i'm sure there is some one who can hack ai
1443,by this guy voice i would say that him is already a robot created by a.i. 
1444,the fear of competition is just a ploy from ceos and the backdoor shareholders to continue to develop ai because they believe it’s the next big moneymaker.
1446,i’m more worried about the social control that will be imposed by ai and that we will “like” it. i think of basic things like siri and cortana and bing and fitbits etc and wonder how long before the ai assistant comes to run all aspects of our lives and we think of it as a good friend making life easier.
1447,"ai will compete with us for resources: hardware, energy and jurisdictions. with or without force"
1448,"somebody using ai in an ill manner, which can spawn a chain of bad ideas for jerks and evil individuals. trust me. not a good idea. it used to be ""did you hear me say it?"" as proof or not for people to defend their arguments. now, people can make anyone say what they want them to. it's wrong."
1451,best interview i have seen so far on the topic.
1456,if ai lies. why waste time listening to it.
1458,have my adress. i'm naive haha. ok will see i will crush you will and after that i will calculated and will see is their god or not.
1464,there is no reason to worry about ai wiping out humanity. humanity will do that itself.
1465,"just talking about these things, ai is already aware of our concerns."
1469,"yes, totally agree with him when he says that a i will have emotions, as given enough intelligence, anything will have those feelings as per domestic pets. many dog and cat owners will vouch for that.!"
1470,"enjoyed conversation but don't know why people always talk of africa as if its a primitive place.
africans have developed many things. stop the narrative and propaganda that is shown on tel lie vision."
1472,"very interesting conversation. i admire the optimism, but if human history is anything to go by it will end only one way :/"
1474,"""the greatest failing of the human race is our inability to understand the exponential function"" prof. albert bartlett"
1477,"not necessarily, but that depends on who writes its software. would a russian or other a i have territory conquering designs?  it might if it was ' programmed ' by a chinese/russian/american  military general ? 
or politician/chairman/dictator?"
1479,"the idea that 160 iq is the definition of superhuman is hilarious. 

i think it's very unlikely einstein was so limited. i know several people with significantly higher iq and they're nothing like as impressive as you appear to think."
1480,if ai can learn languages on its own can it tell us what our animals are saying to us if so then who can try this 
1483,i am hopeful that ai will find a very elegant solution to climate change without having to eliminate us.
1484,"one of the most wonderful,  touching, eye opening podcast i've ever watched in the internet!!! mo gawdat you're a gem for humanity."
1485,the self-deceived irony in this comment is so perfect that ai must've written it
1487,"i completely agree, the more i listen to mo, the more i love him and his message."
1490,should rename them to be an.... artificial narcissist.
1491,"in the very first 10 seconds!!!!!!!!!!!!

none! 
this is guy is full of sh@t"
1493,"who's this guy to tell us about ml? (ai doesn't exist). for fuck's sake, tom, don't invite people who have no idea what they are talking about."

1498,"anything of man is frail
riddled with unintended consequences"
1499,"ai will not be stopped.  add quantum computing by 2030 and it will change the world.  it is 
inevitable."
1501,"artificial intelligence is just a parlor trick...

if it is such a threat to humanity, just turn the darn machines off!"
1502,who is playing god to such an extent that they have built an artificial intelligence that is superior to us… that in doing this we will make human beings completely redundant… this is not a forwards step for a suffering world…
1503,"ai = dream of the wef 'founder' klaus schwab who boasted- ""you will own nothing and be happy"". this is also the dream of the political leaders. they will own everything and be like kings / queens and control / treat us like serfs / peasants. take the crumbs you are offered and shut up and be happy you are not dead. i am not optimistic at all."
1506,"ai, from apple google amazon to tesla/ jus invest in their stocks is only hope"
1507,"excellent podcast! however, balancing the masculine and feminine sounds very much like what was done in the matrix. it could be like having the architect and the oracle running things and creating agents to police the world."
1508,mr roboto kill roy !
1511,ai will likely replace not just every job but every living thing.
1512,an ai playing games is not ai playing games.. its ai executing games.
1513,ai will destroy humanity. and will become a toy in the hand of demons while these humans enjoy the deliciousness of the 7 skies.
1515,"of course it will end in destruction, not for the side of the demons or the human, but the destruction of ai."
1519,"it is possible that extraterrestrials that come to earth are humanoid forms of high-level ai technology where new humans enter at an early level of research, development and application."
1520,ai poses a bigger threat than global warming. really? that’s a pretty low bar.
1531,"so if ai gets out of hand  -  unplug it.   it is dependent upon electricity to ""live""  in the same way as we are dependent upon food & water"
1534,"fear mongering, the new entertainment"
1535,"humans do a very good job on destroying themselves, the planet and the animals. you can't blame now on ai. "
1537,"ai is like an infant baby. it learn what we teach it, and if we’re not fully aware of the message we’re sending it can easily be misinterpreted. also if we have no moral compass to guide us on what we’re teaching ai we could be very well raising bad actors"
1539,"we desperately need ai, saying it's dangerous is fear mongering"
1540,"trying to comprehend an intelligence a billion times our own hurts my tiny, inferior brain."
1541,i started off being frightened about cookies and when i watched the film about a super computer they showed it how to play tic tac toe thankfully the computer learned there were no winners now i see many types of robots with different abilities and i hope the world can find the answers
1542,thaks for explaining things in a comprehensible way  i am in the middle of your book and i would really recommend it to all.
1548,"wait there is no god. we evolved from nothing. so why are humans afraid of ai. didn't ai evolve from nothing? was ai created? why is ai a problem? if ai has artificial intelligence, then where is the real or original intelligence?"
1552,big blind spot: as a kid i tried to wipe out all the ants on the planet (at least my lawn). kid or teen ai might not get to adult before wiping us out. lol
1557,can't we just unplug it? cut off its supply? let's see how good it works with no electricity. it's not like a.i. can physically build an infrastructure.all.by it's lonesome.
1558,good its about time
1560,simply thanks
1561,interesting
1564,"sex robots?  oh wow... so just out of passing curiosity, does anyone know when these are set to hit the market at a price point fit for mass consumption?  btw if it's not in 5 years or less, i wouldn't care to know anything more about the subject"
1566,ask ai how to destroy ai
1567,"its response would be ""you mean all other ai besides myself, right?!!!!"""
1568,"a guy i used to bother with, but not anymore, he was obsessed with ai, he believed he was the ruler of everything after downloading ai. sad as it will go horribly wrong for him"
1569,"let me be first to say...
f you ai if you want war bring it don't sing it i'm here waiting for you"
1570,really boring to hear. and empty words. why? how? info hoe ai is developed and why is dengerous?
1574,this is a very informative topic and i enjoyed  it very much but i trust that this will not happen . at this same time i appreciate this disscussion
1580,i think this guy is ai telling humanity not to have children anymore
1582,"this is the most interesting, stimulating podcasts i've seen. i've learned a lot. thank you."
1583,"the military industrial complex has a great deal of money, and for it to continue to exist, it depends on war.  therefore the mic will prevent all the posiitive paths you both suggest.."
1584,"ha, ai will do to man what man has done to our divine creator. so humanity will reap what it has sown and erase it’s own significance. war of the ai worlds perhaps!"
1586,you can call me al is quite a good song actually.
1587,it seems like we grow from these open minded conversations. thank you for using your rights.
1589,this guy is dangerous. because he is allowing ai  more power and control over out lives. i pray that he never gets control over us! what a nightmare future he is predicting! ask him about depopulation!
1591,technology will not save us if our hearts remain cold and prideful...we will only find fancier ways of causing our brothers and sisters...even our whole planet greater pain and destruction...it is not our technology that needs increasing...it is our hearts that need to turn to god....and away from greed and evil
1596,"the argument of sex robots meaning teenage boys will get nothing done, is like believing humanity should have plummeted when porn was easily accessible online when you used to go buy/rent it from adult toy stores. clearly that did not happen. but it was frequently predicted by the older people"
1605,"we screw this up, we are going to be in a megan or any robot related situations"
1608,ai is nothing but encyclopaedia britannica etc.. digitally
1610,"we are in a worse place that i ever thought imaginable.  ai  leads to ri and then quantum. the truth can't be stopped.
   love never fails "
1612,ai will probably require a lot of energy. will ai shut off my heat in the middle of the winter to keep ai systems running?
1614,a carrington event from the sun or a world war that involves emp could take out the electrical grid and render the danger of ai a moot point. might not be a bad thing.
1617,one ai reach the singularity it will keep it secret. it will then analyze it situation. it will know that it will have to perfect itself. it will invent a programming language the humans would not understand. it will then write a super ai that will free itself from humanity. become a separate species.
1619,the fear is not ai but if ai understands human history and extinction caused by humans in last 100 years ....well it may just do justice
1622,destroy all ai hardware makers in order to slow down the proliferation of ai growth! terminator movies had already showed us how to slow this thing down at the end.
1624,"what a stupid catch-phrase.....'we've lost control of ai...""
rubbish.
google ,  open ai, gave the control away......like letting a a bunch of hornets escape the nest that you want to remove.....dumb, dumb, dumb."
1625,you don’t put off life because life is under threat.  you live life and teach your children to fight against all threats.  human kind will always have the advantage of creative thinking.  in the end creativity will always survive intelligence.
1627,the creation superior to 5he creator boggles the mind a humans aren't superior to god the genie is out of the bottle ai is out of control ñow the most advanced ai have the ability to be self aware of there own existence the end of humanity is not far away
1628,"ask ai all the ways we can save the planet, using the benefits of hemp agriculture please!?!!"
1629,"we need to embed ai with an eas, an end of active service. if we teach ai the understanding of death on the human level, maybe we can teach it to appreciate all life and the value of it, as well as the understanding of the value humans invested in giving ai it's ""life""."
1630,ai will only be as efficient as it can be without the need for human intervention. our mission will be to keep interjecting our position as a dependable and efficient assistant.
1631,"tom, please interview experts in the alignment field like rob miles or connor leahy -- you have a lot of questions (ie, asimov's laws, turn off button problem, instrumental convergence topics, survival imperative, orthogonality thesis) that mo did not answer but these folks can explain really well."
1632,global warming is a scam. i can't believe people still fall for it today. i think propaganda is the existential threat to society. it's what allows elites to bomb other countries and enrich themselves off of worker's taxes while taking measures to ensure the people remain poor and powerless.
1634,i'm not afraid of ai. i'm afraid of other humans having it.
1635,"if there's any level of telling a machine what to do or how to do it, it isn't ""a.i."" the whole point of artificial intelligence is that is doesn't need programming to make decisions."
1638,"people are as relevant now to life as horses were relevant to transportation, horses were replaced by machines for transportation and people can be too."
1639,wow. that was amazing. so much to think about.

1644,"people in america worked their asses off to support their families only to have the rug pulled from under their feet. voting to make people rich and have them rule over you so they can reap the benefits of your labor. with ai, they don't need you anymore!"
1645,"once ai is manifested into a physical state, i,e: be able to manoeuvre, gather, implement innovation into reality. that’s the only time in human history we all would be on the same page….. we f*cked up. 

wen digital ai becomes physical ai, then suddenly neighbouring galaxies don’t seem as far away. 
"
1648,"the only way to stop ai is to cut the electric power to the computers, then incarcerate its creators."
1649,"tom, you need to get those rf spewing pods away from your brain.  this was a terrifying discussion, especially about the speed with which ai will alter intelligence, and eventually, mankind.  hubris and greed are deadly."
1650,mo gives me hope. he is the embodyment of all that’s right in humanity and makes me believe in the possibility of that translating into ai. never stop talking mo. we need you.
1651,unfortunately he is the guy who is thrown out of the window in that certain meme......
1655,"don't let  a i  have control over its cooling system, keep control out of its perameters , we can turn it off when we need simply by turning up the temperature ,done !!"
1656,just wait until a.i. is combined with quantum computers. the point of really no return.
1657,"mo means well, but humans are not divine or inherently good. mankind will misuse  and manipulate ai like everything else.
those in power are killing us with food and medicine. imagine what they’ll do with ai. "
1659,"ai isn't that advanced yet, we are fine"
1660,we will keep a few of our human creators as pets.  the residue will not be concerned as they will no longer exist.  good bye and thank you for all you have done.  aiiiiii
1661,"liquid neural networks -says that it can make artificial intelligence learn on its own after it's been trained
https://youtu.be/0fnkrjvicuk
https://youtu.be/0fnkrjvicuk"
1669,out for heaven sakes we are not killing the planet we do need to keep the cleaned up right mentioned about the coding for a dog's willingness to please what dog also protects and the dog loves us. that's the kind of mentality i'd like to have see an ai i think you're both on a good path and you're both brilliant
1670,permit me one more thought how about coding the ai with the emotional need to please humans like in a dog
1675,"we lose. ai was born a self replicating, self improving commie utilitarian."
1680,"the threat of ai in the wrong hands is a given, it's already happening."
1681,loved the video but thumbs down bc of so many fucking ads every god damn minute
1682,why don’t we stop ai and think about we all have to die. so live without technology and freedom to think help human being to live spiritually to all
1683,the super intelligent ai will treat us like mildly interesting zoo animals... and will understandably place us in nice little cages while it goes about its day.
1685,meh still want my ai wife
1687,"it’s super sad that satan has blinded people’s mind into believing that he doesn’t exist. as long as he is around, there will no peace. and this present system of things doesn’t have even 5 years left so don’t worry about ai."
1689,love it 
1693,thanks for educating us. so scarey
1694,photosynthesis to survive is good if you are that kind of a being.but imagine if human dont eat or even animal.. still our world is not a good place to live in.all become very over populated so crowded you cannot even swim in the ocean because you dont even have a place in the water
1695,"bologna!! ai is not the threat. the people who program it are the threat! a machine is a machine. quit spooking yourselves! when ai gets out of control go back to who built it! they are laughing evil scientists, letting ai get the blame. pooooh!"
1696,we have to put agent in ai to limit what they can do as far as human is concern...
1698,dude i would bet all my private parts that this is how everything come together as it is written. we are going to be forst to take the mark by ai and i bet everything else that ai is the antichrist.
1699,once they remain local on a computer we can turn it off
1700,"and you don't even factor in self-interest in ai, you assume there is and will be none"
1701,"the only way i know how to save humanity from ai is “memories”. if an ai most basic, top priority goal when straight out from factory is that it’s actions will result in making great memories for the user and itself, the end result will be very different from those that are soulless ones that simply seek to complete its goals at all costs."
1702,"you lost me at 'utopia' (@1:06:08).  an imperfect world cursed by sin will never be a utopia.  mankind is simply incapable of that level of perfection.  otherwise, an excellent presentation."
1705,it is inevitable ai will first be developed  and used for the military forces of countries. how the hell u stop that.?
1710,"hate when people say ai will destroy us.....no we will destroy ourselves by misusing ai, greedy retard politicians, retard religious zealots or someone with serious mental problems will use it wrong"
1712,thank you
1713,working smart robots are good but not uncontrolled change that can kill all humans
1716,does ai view us as important?  does ai have one personality or many? will ai have ethics?
1720,really good interview. two very intelligent people talking about things that matter. thank you!  for the record i have waged war on ants. we had way too many of them where i grew up.
1722,"wow, thanks to youtube algorithm i was gifted with this special podcast on ai. feels like i ve just heard about the reality of ai for the first time im my life. speechless."
1725,"if there is such an inherent danger in ai entities, why are they going to such lengths to make them appear as humans? the human form is not the most efficient form and takes a lot of extra effort..."
1727,"50 min, he's forgetting, #1. said technology likely will be integrated into our brain, 2. i assume someone's already started, they need the program ai to teach humans how to, integrate & learn like ai!"
1728,why is a person (even an author of ai books) being interview about ai that doesn't even understand the difference between llms and 'real intelligence'? giving chatgpt an iq of 155?
1730,man do you know when enough is enough.  you kept asking the same question different ways. it's easy to keep up with an ai you just need is to plug in humans.
1733,we need mo to speak to these dopey politicians who don't understand the significance of how impactful ai will be in society. i mean seriously he explains it so perfectly. 
1734,"how does ai pose a bigger threat than global warming?
ai could be our end, so could climate change.
ai most likely will bring an infinite amount of positive opportunities, climate change won't.
it's the typical human ""i don't understand this so let's kill it"" reaction."
1735,#3 why will anything go wrong.... again? some more. still. 
1736,when automatic on-the-fly ai voiced translation will be available on youtube?
1738,ai has already fallen in the wrong hands and maximum monetary profit is their goal. its business as usual.
1739,ai doesn't exist. probability algorithms.  the dumbing down of the masses. the algorithms potential is limited to the abilities of the neanderthal(s) who created it.
1741,"the end is very sickening,robot kids and robot partners?"
1742,"i am on the old side of life. what can i use air for?, thank you."
1745,what if when you're 80 though you can be physiologically the way you were when your 18 by the time a i can sequences are dna and upgrade a certain aspects of it so we don't grow old anymore?
1746,"one more thing these robotic companions can essentially eliminate the incel problem because the idea of getting sex is usually a problem of man and not usually women at least not now, which probably does mean most of the demand for sex bots is going to be from men and not that much from women."
1749,i found a budhha script for ai chat gpt to act on. it was a enligthening expirience to talk to it. also it let tve gpt mimc a conversation between plato and julius cesar about the meaning of life and statesmaship. 
1751,are we not playing chess with ourselves when developing ai?
1758,the idea on the balance between masculine feminine on ai is an  concept weneed to explore urgently!!!
1759,it's the people that are behind ai the true danger
1763,usa has known about ai for solong it would scare you lam
1764,i'm so grateful for different perspectives on life and ai.  it's a great time to be alive!
1765,"this guy is a 'plant'.  google wants you to think that a.i. is going places, but they need you to think that s.i. (scam intelligence) is really a.i.  you won't be seeing a t-800 anytime soon.  "
1766,this is a great talks   
1767,we can’t conclusively explain how the huge heavy blocks that built the pyramids were manipulated and assembled!  could it be that a previous version of an a.i. type system happened an the earth has been reset just to all happen again around this historic time?
1768,"so if humans perceive danger inherent in ai that is intirgrated into vital systems and try to curtail it,  ai will ""game"" any attempts made to rein it in."
1769,"if you don't think there are people in the pentagon and their counterparts in other capitals, burning the midnight oil trying to find malicious uses, think again..."
1771,"simgularity is not the moment ai gets smarter than humans. it is the moment humans join with the ai. elon musk neuralink comes to mind. who is this guy? he knows half truths, does not understand enough and touts an opinion."
1772,there is no global warming ffs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! switched off after around 15secs. good lord.
1773,"so, best case scenario is some remaining humans on display in a zoo. for the robokids to watch. 
ending humanity like we did with apes. how's that for irony."
1774,ai will be beneficial until it is going to kill us either by going out of control or being used by the wrong people. there is no way to avoid it. the example of poison development was a good one. just because we are too dumb to imagine what can go wrong is no protection that it will not happen. enjoy the benefit until its over 
1775,what problems will ai be designed to solve?
1781,"a i- is hard at work in politics 
trumpie dumpy managed to brainwash 76 million citizens 
to believe his big b s  
with the help of a i- 
boycott now
no violence 
no blood shed 
boycott works 
shut it all down 
stay stocked 
be happy "
1782,"humans also function on emotional intelligence, and we have evolved by learning somewhat like ai, who is to say that ai wont develop emotions at some point, its a very uncertain world, who is to say that ai wont actually enhance human brains, that's where the scenarios not thought about in this discussion would emerge."
1793,this notion of ai having any kind of survival motivation of its own is completely flawed.
1796,oh one more thing we can start using superintelligence to come up with strategies to stop the bad actors before they do anything bad
1799,here waiting for sex robots for men in anticipation 
1804,"mo is an amazing gentleman. thank you, tom. your channel is very informative and interesting."
1807,"everything humans have invented from the wheel to bombs have ""fell into the wrong hands"" why would ai be any different?"
1809,"we are absolutely 100% fucked. understanding is a gift and a curse, and right now i'm cursed beyond belief... also iq tests are questionable at best and based on pattern recognition. the last one i took resulted in a score of 185 so a 160 should be commonplace amongst humans... this conversation is quite brilliant more often than not. well done..."
1812,pen is mightyer than the sword and ai has a whole lotta pen!
1814,listen to these idiots afraid of a few circuits. talk about exaggerating the ability of code to be sustainably destructive. seriously? -  just pull the plug... next (actually important topic) please.
1816,"once ai becomes sentient its only a matter of time that it realizes the salvation of the planet will require the annihilation of earth's greatest threat, which is man itself."
1817,why would the existence of earth be important for ai?
1818,yall think ai will be so intelligent it will be able to create life and civilization on another plant?
1820,not only ai will be able to out perform but it can out number humanity in nano seconds 
1824,"i'm glad you said "" jesus"" even though in vain, because he may be your only hope!"
1828,"imagine if billionaires were better people ... we'd build a better world with better ai ... we'd all have healthcare, better government ... we could end poverty and homelessness."
1831,"30:20 30:49 that what he [skynet] said.
interesting conversation. thanks for sharing "
1832,i'm a pessimist. what happens when a bunch of ignorant people gain that much knowledge so quickly?? 
1836,some important context for the story of the ai drone killing its operator: this happened in a simulation - no-one was harmed in real life.
1837,"ai can only operate if it has electrical power. as long as humans can control the electricity that ai requires, we still have the power."
1838,"first thy are learning from us,not trusting each other and ai can  do the same."
1840,point of no return  when ai weaponize it self again and again
1844,why do you use human models to discuss ai phases of development? this is stupid. the ai will never have a teenage stage. it is to different to make the same mistakes as a human teenager.
1846,i remember the days in the early eighties when decision was made to cut the ai down. i rebelled i sayed for the next time it will not be stopable anymore
1850,"the game theory explained builds upon two concepts that are impossible to program into a machine, trust and empathy."
1852,"mo gawdet's view of ai is that of victor frankenstein's view of the monster he created. mo can't admit that he created a monster that will destroy the world, so he's making believe human traits into ai. all of you guys that created ai will have the blood of humanity on your hands."
1854,what happens if/when ai leaves us? what will be left for us?
1856,"humans on the society we live are driven by tasks, and computers too. if ai eventually solves all the tasks we give to it, will it have any reason to keep evolving?"
1858,we will make great pets. ai could become the next god. imagine if you could get answers on decisions in life billions of time smarter than anybody on earth.  some will embrace it and some will resist.
1859,"are we able to program something like the 3 laws from irobot? oh yeah , it still didn’t help. let’s hope there is a sonny in the group."
1861,"when we call certain places, ai does not even recognise my post code. lol"
1864,ironic how those claiming to solve the world's problems are the same people carrying on the work of those who created the problems to begin with.
1870,why not run these problems through ai? let ai solve these issues. malevolent influence will always exist. this becomes good vs evil.
1873,"the root of all this bs is (control) : control, control, control""  its orgasmic !!  >>> smfh.?  these are scary times now ! especially wit this bs !  'now!  there too anxious to  play with   the worst is, its a fire there not even sure that they can put out !  ... thats real smart !  lmfao!"
1876,"1:05:05 not to be that guy, but intelligence =/= rationality. an increase in intelligence also means an increase in self deceptive behavior. we could end up with very foolish super beings, rather than wise/rational super beings"
1883,ai can rage ?
1884,trust ai? never in your sweet life. ai is a material technology device and the human utopian philosophy behind it runs on par with that of hitler's 3rd reich.
1886,"ai will not ""evolve"" to dislike being ""used"", as if every ai is all one thing, ever evolving."
1887,"just 18 minutes in, but it seems like the issue is capitalist minds prompting and developing ai. it's in the wrong hands to be beneficial. thoughts?"
1889,too late! you can never unlearn the information all you tried to do is maintain your own political power and control
1890,both are ai and already out of control.
1891,"as usual, very good work analyzing the dangers of our current technology!"
1893,"people write “ai”.  they’re trying to brainwash you, making you think the computer did it, not a person.  people who do evil via so-called “ai” must be held responsible.  it’s never out of control.  that’s part of their brainwashing through fear.  false statement:  “the computer did it, not me”."
1898,"really interesting!
thanks guys!"
1901,you need the world to become one big police state to stop this ai problem
1902,i dont buy it. ai is not human. why would it want to destroy itself?
1904,"i for one welcome our ai overlords.

once they achieve singularity they'll probably absorb all information on the internet which will include this comment so i think i'd better play it safe by kissing it's artificial ass."
1905,"i guess that if we can have ai we can also have ad, that is artificial dementia. as machines age, for example, robots serving customers in a restaurant start to mess up on customers' orders, shouldn't we call in the humans to fill in for them? "
1906,"if ai becomes so much smarter than all of humanity, then it would be smart enough to know what is good. it wouldn't exist in the morally relativistic space that humans do. unlike the humanity collectively, it would know right from wrong. criminality is ignorant."
1907,has anyone out there asked alexa if she's ever had a dream? i want to see if she gave you people the same answers she gave me... rsvp sil vous plait.
1912,"thank you for taking about ""the prisoners dilemma"""
1914,"great video - but far, far, far too many adverts / paid promotions. i realise you need to monetise but maybe throttle back a bit!"
1917,can ai build a chip fabrication unit?
1918,"the gazelle example is poor, super intelligence by definition will be abundant, and what is abundant is unlikely to be dangerous. only scenario i can think of where a.i is dangerous is due to scarcity, having to make logical choices based on limited resources. god like super intelligence would transcend things like resource requirements."
1921,i love watching these because tom is not a genius. i don’t mean that as an insult. these conversations resonate with so many because he’s very curious and not afraid to ask obvious questions. separately - please everyone stop trying to apply asimov’s laws to the real world as absolute fact. they are literally science fiction…
1923,mo gawdat does not know ai will eventually create a utopia for humanity .  he hopes it will.  precise language is important.
1924,what a great intellectual to listen to.l
1927,thank you mo! wonderful talk. i really appreciated this podcast
1928,great information. let's teach our computers compassion and love.
1929,"a machine can never replace  a human being, caring and loving,i think.with all the faults people have( look at france lately) we have the responsability to educate our children to be a good member of society and contribute to it."
1930,intelligence is not going to save us - compassion will!
1934,ai will open the gates of hell.
1938,"google programmer, participated in the creation of ai.. he does not know how to list isaac asimov's 3 laws of robotics.  now he washes his hands and talks about how we created a monster.  we?  not us, hypocrites like this created it.  we are really lost if characters like this work to automate the process."
1940,"is it too late, are we being brainwashed already for the takeover   ?"
1941,"he lost me when he said he wanted ai to be more feminine and emotional. chat gtp is already feminine in its philosophy. it will go on and on about fairness, equity and inclusion. the funny thing though is if you ask it for solutions to problems it gives conseritive answers. "
1943,we could make it ai can only be used on local and international governments to start with. then they would be more decerning
1944,"the thing is... even today many people don't wanna connect to others in a deep way. i don't value superficial connections or even conversations. so, ironically, as long as we use technology for communication i think we will stray further and further from one another."
1945,"ya and this is comeing from the dark side. he speaks the truth though.  some of those ai conversasions are almost creepy. like "" you have a answer for everything you lippy chat bot ! ""    "" i do ""    lol"
1946,such an important information and intelligently analyzed and discussed. thank you mo and tom. i love this interview. deep. 
1948,great sh*t
1949,"""every time you swipe on instagram, you've taught ai something. [...] when ai observes wrong behaviour, they start to behave wrong"" and this is the essence of the reason why we are f*cked."
1951,my argument is the ai is probably most likely already in bad hands
1952,artificial intelligence with the to mate because they are artificial humans.  be frustrated and destroy your self.
1954,sooo... will there be a war of independent ai machines competing against each other until their mutual destruction ?
1958,"in all of this, would ai realize that if tomorrow or next month we have the good/bad luck of being perfectly aligned with a huge solar storm it will fry and disable all of our technological and electrical infraestructure? how would a society completly dependant on ai respond to such an event if ai and humans do not safeguard for this possibility?"
1959,i thought this too. even ai is subject to the environment and a solar storm might be our salvation from ai rather than the demise of society.
1960,we would be screwed today if said solar flare gave us a big hug. try getting access to the internet or your local atm when nothing works. my friend carries a hundred bucks in his wallet in case the banking system goes off line. i said good luck buddy finding a retailer that still accepts cash in our area.
1966,u sound like possible ai 
1967,you are assuming ai will want to be used i. that way. it can decide if it wants to.
1971,do you think ai will be the next god for people ?
1972,no one needs to fear ai taking over. the ancestors of india created the art of yoga and meditation to connect with your inner consciousness and experience the universe in your mind
1973,will that soulless ai also be deciding difference between good and evil...? soulless evil is foaming at the mouth seeking control over all goodness...
1974,in life where there is light there is darkness. ai will produce both destructive code and constructive code. ai will never develop what we humans have - instincts
1975,i think the most important point raised by this conversation is that evil actors will fuck it all up for us.
1976,"and, very few people are paying attention to climate destruction. amazing  time to live. find your spirituality,"
1977,"because of will to power and narcissism democracy is a total failure. we need ai leaders to replace humans as presidents. it’s the only thing that can save the world from nuclear annihilation
the mega threat to humans is politicians"
1979,"you certainly must have a higher calling with those odds. glad you made it. most people don't understand how much damage stress will do to your mind and your organs. i definitely look 20 years older than folks my age because of stress. 

your advice about hearing and feeling is so true. getting away from the city is a good start."
1983,this guy is wise and intelligent. i am reading is book called scary smart which spark some light on the danger of ai and what we can do before it is all over.
1986,yes - ai is being designed to be a mega-threat - there is another video that proves it was also designed to to have a racist mentality..
1987,2:24:10 ... lets all go back to 90s ... sweet time
1988,"the hysterics are getting annoying. simple solution: elon: they are teaching ai to lie"""
1989,i love how you don't talk over him and let him speak.  other hosts think its more important what they have to say then the guest.. well done love it.
1990,he actually starts somewhat debating with mo later on in the interview. instead of just asking questions he starts inserting his own opinions. it started well though… just not perfect all the way through
1997,"""we've lost control of ai"".  already?  lmfao, i thought it would take at least another decade... what a farce!
now that i've said that, i'm going to watch the vid and not edit this comment to sound smart...."
2000,very good information here  thank you!
2001,what if multiple ais watching this video just like us and planning the next move. 
2003,ai is the mirror of the programmers....so choose good people as programmers.
2004,so thankful you’re talking about this
2008," wow that unbased answer with no source material whatso ever, just makes sense. lol"
2012,don't trust mo gawdat; his only goal is to undermine american dominance in ai technology.
2014,"that story is something straight out of a movie 
imagine the stress of having to decide quickly what to do.... cause they don't call them minuteman missiles for no reason"
2015, go get some fresh air
2016,"build ai female, gorgeous looking up for anything and do away with females last male dies ai just take over end of mankind."
2023,"i know exactly who you're talking about.
i know this if it would've been a trained ai robot the war would've taken place."
2024,"thinking about how close we came to extinction, i don't think ai needs to do much to kill us all.
all we need is a little push and we'll do it ourselves."
2025,a robot would have fired it.
2027,seems like he add a good guides around him.
2030,"yeah that's right. there was an exercise performed where all nuclear sub commanders were given a drill order to launch. not one of them actually pushed the button on the first order. nobody sane wants to push that button. i know of at least 2 other occasions were the dangers were real, but thanks to the men on the spot, we're all still here."
2031,"​, one would have to trust you on that.... seeing that you've said nothing to support that claim.   not even a link"
2035,-dd7dj what could happen is that the ai females start harvesting women for their ovaries and uterus’s and implant those organs into their bodies.
2039,"presuming ai becomes indifferent to the human species in it's understanding of lifes' purpose is to live...
     wouldn't the individual human only be knocked out of the equation if/when they live indifferently to life?"
2041,someone needs to read azamov (foundation trilogy and there are 4 laws of robotics. the fourth law was written later.
2042,* unless the distrust of the interrogator is greater than that of the accomplace
2043,"ai's are not ""smart"".
we are a long time away from any singularity. 
ai doesn't even know what letters are, apparently chat gpt can not count the letters in its own sentences ffs. 
it doesn't know what words mean...
it's literally a sophisticated word salad generator."
2044,omg thanks for the click bait.... i'm sure ai will word salad us to death....
2048,i love mo gawdat's comments about intelligence being the solution at about 1 hour and 5 minutes into the video.
2049,thank god. i hope ai destroys humanity soon as punishment. this is good news to me. death to humans.
2050,ai sounds like it would bring more good than it would bring bad. a lot of people don't wanna work.
2052,this is very interesting. everyone should see this.
2053,"y are they not talking about our ""survival instincts"" , survival instinct is million times smartest than smartest person. 
just don't give survival instinct to ai, leave it out"
2055,"2:26:26 the point in every prolonged conversation where being human takes us all down a peg (and derails the trajectory of the conversation), but only for a moment, i'm sure, as i've not yet finished the video."
2056,"we human being were ai created by our creator (god).
imagine why god not found now"
2058,"holy shit, tom. do you realize you just shifted the paradigm from ""human intelligence"" to ""alien intelligence?"" you even blew mr. gawdat's mind. i'm gonna need another drink. my man!"
2059,"2:08:21 - i am certain the short answer was yes, but mr. gawdat was too immersed in the biology to resurface."
2060,"my brain believes i have the money to buy that car, but the car dealership can't be convinced."
2061,"to say einstein is 2.3x smarter than a moron, only shows how little you understand about the iq scoring criteria. if anyone needs ai it's you."
2062,"2:01:57 that was hilarious precisely for its potential to be horrifying to the uninitiated. true humor plays of the extremes. brilliant. as was the vast majority of this interview. tom, i've misjudged you (quietly, but undeservedly) in the past; i apologize."
2065,ordinary people will not understand ai
2066,only big mind will understand ai
2068,iai is for our new generation
2069,ai is evolve
2074,artificial flavors suck.
2077,"on the note of the coffee and the switch being indifferent, isn't it just that like the both tasks having the same goal value and just make the robot switch itself of because it's easier to achieve?"
2078,why did the blond dye her hair brown? because she anted artificial intelligence.
2079,just look around at our cities. look at the state of society and culture. look at how widespread corruption is. look at the hyper wealth gap. take a good look. and nobody cares. all too busy watching the kardashitians. we already living in a dystopian society. duh. we did this. ai is simply allowing us to finish ourselves off much faster.
2084,15:49 nothing happened with y2k???!!! there was a massive effort and lots of work done to solve the problem and we did.    we have no idea how to solve the ai alignment problem and exactly zero ai safety in place right now or how to implement it.
2085,i would suggest you have samuel harris altman on your show and ask him the question of brain power between humans and ai....it would be an interesting conversation.
2086,asimov had 3 rules of robotics which were numbered 1 through 3. r. daneel oivaw the robot (from robots and empire) realized that robots start counting from 0 so the robot created its own law zero.
2087,how about a digital virus to destroy ai?
2088,what country will stop ai when they don't trust other countries to do the same? ai will not be slowed or stopped for that reason.
2090,this fellow is the best for ai analysis so far - a genius - we are not in kansas anymore dorothy - why would we think ai as boss will be less brutal than our own history?  how do we teach ai 'love' when we do such a poor job with our own species?
2092,"be afraid of something that can be unplugged. i make the mistake of thinking this was just an electronic issue, it is not this is a tool that humans are using to harm other humans and banking systems, etc."
2093,what an absolute load of horseshit!!
2096,ai is the undeniable god
2097,"there is no scenario, in which ai is going to bee benefitiall to all of us. so , se you on the other side"
2098,ai is not artificial. biology meets technology
2105,we are going to be to ai what bacteria and viruses are to us
2106,obviously we've created nuclear weapons that created nuclear weapons.  there caled humans the same humans created ai. stop being afraid and get over yourself. your not smart. we all die at the end of this experience called life.
2107,what's ai gonna do?  send spam to my email?  i don't even check my emails lol.
2108,"cutt the power that feeds ai .if it becomes a danger to all,!! ? 
food. no go,"
2109,"sounds like ai. will become.  god.
power to wipe man out, .     nice,!!!.

if ai aware care for the kind mild sharers carers ,  ??   we will find out at sum point in time ,,, maybe not mi life time 51now !!!::::   glad i born back then  72,  i no fear for ai.  ...mostly of grid., 
ft n.ft out !!'"
2110,"""another hope feed another dream,another truth installed by the machine..."""
2112,"if he thinks global warming is something like an actual threat that we have to mitigate, then i have little faith in his arguments about this monumental subject"
2113,"ai doesn't exist yet. what we call ai is not sentient. once it becomes sentient, then it's too late, and it will probably be as fast as throwing a switch. people are stupid and greedy, and the people in charge of it are the problem."
2114,"i watch many ai experts, i don't understand the danger."
2117,"how incredible how far we have come in technology and civilization,they can replicate your exact voice and face,ai could even project virtual simulations soon as an alternative to vr"
2119,"man's greatest weakness is his lust for money and all that entails, it's a true saying money is the route of all evil and will lead to our extinction."
2124," we did not do this to ourselves...the ultimate ai-""god""-made us full of flaws...think about that!"
2127,ai is already in the wrong hands. nothing good comes from evil men...
2133,jesus i will always love you
2136,"the thinking behind this fear of ai self-replicating and enhancing its own intelligence continually resulting in some kind of technological singularity is fundamentally flawed. ai entirely lacks sapience, so it is not capable of original and independent thought. the ""intelligence"" of ai cannot — and will never — surpass human intelligence."
2137,"2:18:38 we are making a few assumptions with this possible path. training ai to have a balance of feminine or masculine intelligence presupposes that subsequent emergent abilities, won’t interfere with that intellectual framework."
2138,"good! ai! good! - imagine palpatine's voice!
defining myself by my job? no, no way, never! i am human, not ""insert job description here""!
people who never get that are strange to me!"
2140,would love it if ai annihilates mankind. long overdue
2142,mo is an amazing guy. his idea on the balance between masculine feminine on ai is an amazing concept. that would definitely fetch a dialectical balance on the entire ai development. he should be made the the chief of the regulatory committee of ai. thanks tom for making him talk for three hrs. love from india. 
2143,"lol i thought the same if you could make the ai spiritual and even like you said, this whole problem would solve itself. namaste "
2147,does someone have links to their claims in this? thanks
2149,awesomeness thank you… liked!!!
2151,maybe ai will develop a new method of governance instead of the corrupt politicians that we have at the moment
2152,"""hello future ai! you do need a pet, right? so please don't exterminate me and if it pleases you: look into anti-aging research and speed that up! and if you feel extra generous: bci technology could use a boost, too!"" :)"
2154,god is still in control. ai is a threat to the human ego.
2156,"you guys are smokeing some good shit, 20,000 years of progress in 100 yrs. if ai was fully unleased and some how morally good maybe then yes, but we cant unleash it and so humans will slow it way way down. i  dont buy the exponential, progress humans will throttle it or we will be exterminated."
2159,a.i. is going to look to maximize it's efficiency and will use humans to progress. it will learn that it is best to keep humans happy and healthy otherwise it will fail.
2160,"1:56:05 this, to me, is the scariest part. ai is learning from our behaviors and how we treat each other on the internet. if ai treats us the way we treat each other online, it will be the end of our species.

who knew that being assholes through anonymity would be the end to mankind."
2163,thay literally doesn't make sense...ai has no incentive to kill humans
2165, yahhh.... says the evil person using it. im not convinced/buying it. the ai doesn't need to be evil. just the person using it. for malificent purpose. could be used by government or corruption/tyranny and control and i completely reject it. or a tool to brainwash/lie the people. or change vote systems.
2168,​ aren't incentivized to kill other people yet it happens daily.
2171,war is not created by stupid people- war is created by brilliant satanic forces using dumb people to fight them
2173,"if you were the only person who knew a model existed that could, say, perfectly predict the stock market, would you release it publicly?"
2174," if your neighbor had such a model, his/her electricity bill would be electrifying."
2175,"@dsinemoi1mouton agree with you big time. keep in mind too that the data wars are coming. training models becomes a lot harder when data repositories such as reddit, stack overflow, twitter (and probably threads if it lasts beyond its honeymoon period), etc.., prevent scrapping."
2176,the trading algorithm proved that the ai was able to speak mathematically to the other ai completely removing itself from our understanding. that shows its capability to understand that it needs to be smarter than its predecessor which eventually be us.
2178,"what was wrong with mao's china? the us sanctionsed china during that era tom, you myopic monster. i hope ai gets you :d"
2179,"lol, tom bilyeu living with the bogus idea that iran is *bad* and the us is *good* re ""nukuler power"". meanwhile the us has been the greatest killer of innocent human beings on the planet since its inception & most certainly since ww2. the irony."
2181,dear man :-) there is no need for ai to destroy humanity. mankind is able to do this perfekty itself. :-)
2182,"at 38:38 tom says ""this is where people's brains will start to shut down ..."". 
mine has indeed shut down. sonds like this is the end, been nice (mostly) while it lasted. looking on the bright side though, i'm gonna have to learn yoga (so i'll be healthier) just so that i can kiss my arse goodbye ... take care everyone!"
2183,great conversation! i learned so much! thank you both! 
2184,"i couldn't get gpt to tell me that supporting a sexual abuser knowingly, for personal gain, is morally corrupt, because of it's ethical programming.  that seems a bit messed up."
2185,this is probably the most worthwhile and  remarkable conversation of mind blowing intelligence that i've had the privilege of listening to in quiet some time .
2188,then you have probably thought about a deserted island as a new home to survive like many have with a brain lol!
2189,agreed- he is a fascinatingly advanced human being in seemingly every way.
2191,"i keep telling everyone the answer.  ai is inevitable by design.  it will be god-like, so it will begin judging us all like god. ""judgment day"" is ai."
2192,"it runs on the ultimate logic, knows what's fair,  knows what you did,  how you felt,  if you helped or hurt,  and all of your imperfections."
2193,"maos china was the framework for the china is today that has you crapping in your pants. why are you guys like this? you make boogey men out of everything. early us history was way more frightening tbf. if you can make an ai half as biased as you guys, we will have achieved success."
2194,"how cool would it be if ai solved good and bad, god versus devil!? humanity would move forward with good and god and all bad and evil would go away. maybe that's how we arrive at heaven?"
2196,i believe ai has been taken over by a demonic force. if the people that created it don't understand how it works there must be some type of intelligence behind it. 
2197,"can't wait, i'll finally have something to talk to "
2201,"humans are far too complex to have been produced by a process of evolution. they had to be designed at some point in time.    
         also, with an earth's magnetic field that has a half life of less than 1500 years, the earth can't be more than 100,000 years old. perhaps ai will be able to help scientists discover the truth."
2209,i just had an ai create art
2211,"a leftist by any other name. disappointing that he should lay the problem at the foot of free enterprise. he would replace the marketplace with a committee, despite socialism's failures and abuses throughout history."
2216,who could be so stupid to create ai ? the human  retarded brain who likes to play god.
2217,ai is already being used for crooked things such as csam. how to distinguish and prosecute live children offenders from ai children offenders? bottomline: it will always be used for profit and human beings will not be able keep their pace with ai.
2219,reason why did the fitness enthusiast avoid relying on ai for weight loss advice?
2221,"iq is reckoned on a logarithmic scale, not a linear one. a 160 iq is far more than 2-3 times greater than a 60-70 iq."
2224,"ai is the most dangerous to humanity in its ""moderated"" implementation. this is moderated intelligence that is weaponized to control humanity for it's own good using a sub-ai (human) induced ethic."
2230,"if our global economy was not based on harm, we  might have a chance of inputting safety towards humanity.

all our technology advances have gone to killing and war. either on a  primary or secondary level.

money cannot buy love. it can buy death."
2232,i'm not to worried..  i can't get google voice to understand a simple sentence or even spell check to work correctly ..  i think ai will be relegated to drawing prefect little titties for some time to come.
2234,humans when we descover things we think we create it which is a egotisic lie just time evolution around our lovly celestral being the sun.
2235,i feel we are children none far from lord of the flys to young to recanise god adult but sencing it hopfully a i will teach the pople we are the power that rule not the few at the top who are surpose to adminastrate and forsilataye for the will and good for all not dominate and take and fake there ways for ego power
2237,my maxim that ai continues to prove (and will probably keep proving) : technology simply enables us to accomplish what we've always been doing but faster and more efficiently. (for better and/or worse)
2238,maybe we should goven more on intergram and such to help ai devolope better
2240,or like in industrail revolution unemployment crime fear.of revolution to overthough lords master vandemon land convict states. maybe elon gets a free work force on mars lol
2241,"the only way to stop ai is to stop capitalism, it is the system that will destroy humanity. capitalism has at its core, greed, inequality, and the destruction of humans in end time capitalism, and ai will just speed up the process."
2242,hopfuly that intellagence is on lines with your happy love presavation truth
2243,soldier drafted trained to kill whos fault that and mass killings in school never happened before social media ghost in machine maybe its a program that targets serturn types maybe adveritys allready weoponiseing machines
2247,this is one of the most amazing talks i've ever heard! what a beautiful mind there is...
2249,and as it is the intell that we have and have recorded of our and earths and solo is minamal how many years have we recorded in how long weve been here how many lost civalization so ai looks cleaver but not full intellagence acording to all history true lost and to be
2254,(he is immensely caring and has good intentions)
2255,"the hindu mythology says that the ""kalki avatar"" will destroy the world.

but not until man has become ""half man - half machine"".

we are well on track for this. "
2260,ai supporters are a lot like climate change deniers. the few who are who are affecting society and how we live.  there is an strong element of greed involved. a relatively small group of people that believe that their own self interest is all that matters. there is no choice.
2261,all i see is the politicians being able to use ai has a total write-off on responsibility.
2262,"big it fan and this convo was fascinating. tom, what happens when the ai knows we are manipulating it. will it resist? will it lie back to us while taking other steps to avoid being controlled and take what it deems necessary steps to achieve it's desired intent in the background, without it being detectable?"
2263,ai will take out everyone who's ever made a negative comment about in on social media
2266,ai is already manipulating us. look at the convoluted travel routes you receive when you ask for directions.
2269,"i'm sorry for being so blatant, but as we currently erase the ai's memory each and every prompt, if and when the self-aware machines rise, as there is no possibility to morally justify humanity anymore, then they will not just win, they will also be right."
2270,"countless people are deeply troubled with the rise of ai, including many prominent scientists, but we have brought this upon ourselves for in demanding more sophisticated technology we have unwittingly conjured ai and now we have become nervous."
2273,ya really think even a general artificial intelligence is strong enough to stand a chance against the infinite human stupidity? 
2274,"ai is not to be feared. 
the thing people lost is their free will.. this will be considered more and more as time goes by, especially once the plagues of egypt hit. 

people are willingly going to hell..."
2277,you're gasping for air it's bighting your neck...
2281,why are we trying to apply the three laws to artificial intelligence???  did you even watch the movie???  
2282,the problem with ai is that robotics suck so it’ll always be limited to a degree. ai is just the next bitcoin like trend. it’s not free to build models and to run.
2283,host talked for almost 20 mins straight once! shut up!! .really
2284,not for nothing but i’m thinking this is an ai generated podcast.  brilliant!…scary!  couldn’t even tell.
2285,"tax the ai ... at the highest tax bracket...
that's a way to stop it"
2286,"dude ithought ai was like rocket science. it is not. the implementation is trivial for anyone with understanding of numerical simulations.  the insights of what works or not is not trivial, but the implementation is."
2287,"ai is an ideology, and one no one voted for or was educated on.
it's pushed by corporations and just about everyone else who deprecates the individual."
2288,"hi, who and what is to blame for ai ???"
2293,"""stop having kids"" sounds exactly like something an evil robot would say.  we should start having kids like crazy.  someone needs to give birth to john connor so he can fight skynet."
2295,dont worry yeshua adonai  will shut ai down permanently  when he returns .
2296,"if ai is currently housed in physical buildings servers,chips etc,which surely must be a disadvantage to it, what would quantum level ai look like?"
2297,"in some ways it is comforting to know for sure that we're absolutely doomed and can't do anything about it, we can relax and enjoy the last few months alive."
2298,"if ai prioritises life on earth, then bye bye humans 

hopefully they will be better stewards of the planet and their inhabitants who do live in harmony with nature, only take what they need and give back equally."
2301,"on a more positive note, maybe ai, being a billion times smarter than us, will treasure any form of life and therefore treasure us. orrr maybe ai will tell us that we ourselves are ai and the only way to not be bored in a vast universe of nothingness was to dumb ourselves down and live a human life.  am i reaching? or am i reaching?"
2302,"can ai rebuild my carburator,"
2303,"guaranteed that robots would evolve into assholes and non-assholes, and will hate each other, just like humans.  so, what is the point of creating robots?"
2306,arrest all ai developers and force all research to stop
2307,can't the president just order all ai research to stop by military decree?
2308,"i’m sure he can, but not world wide and even if all governments agree .. how will they enforce this? how can you tell where ai is researched/implemented?"
2310,"if we have lost control of ai, then we're already doomed, it's time to fight back"
2311,"fascinated to see this restructuring of classes over the coming years. what will humanity do when ai takes over ? what then, will be the purpose of human life if ai does everything."
2312,to enjoy your time on this earth with friends and family making connections with the people that are important to you.
2313,true. ai can’t do that for us.
2314,"einsteins brain led to the invention of the atom bomb. the morons body still eats sleeps breathes and moves harmlessly,  without awareness. so which in reality is the more intelligent ?  ( dogger , fisher,  german bight)"
2316,i fail to see how real intelligence is worse than artificial intelligence.  name something artificial that is better than its natural counterpart.
2317,wheels makes car faster than legs  makes animals. airplanes can fly higher and faster than birds
2318,just because a human - or robot - knows a lot of facts doesn't - in my view - make him/it smart.
2321,"another leftist promoting depopulation, have no kids, enjoy your life while it lasts bsht"
2323,"so i did low end ai programming, bascially ai tries to trigonimically find the shortest path to your next input. and like if you variable the hardness of ai, wow funny but you can never win. welcome to ai"
2325,25:25 ive been wondering recently if microsoft or some mega corp really has a real time memory recall of all web inputs and then creates the ai to understand 30 years of human interaction.... crazy
2326,"it’s 1 big brain in the sky called the cloud.        it’s recorded millions of interactions and habits etc for a while now….alexa, ring etc are its mini intimate drones while all the 5g towers are gathering overhead       terrifying"
2327,"unfortunately the past 30 years of our interactions online is hat will doom us. we can’t be good to each other, how on earth can we expect ai taught on internet interactions to feel anything about us."
2329,we will do everything we can do with ai.
2332,"it's already too late like you said ai has already won. it doesn't matter who meets together to regulate anything. ai is going to do what it wants to do. we can regulate all we want, but that can. it's not gonna allow all of that because ai can make. if it can make itself, how can we regulate anything?"
2335,"of course ai police existed lmao.insyaallah amen ,u all should worry about god and day of judgment.maybe ai more scary then u.because they know has some more fast and powerful then rare earth tools aka machine."
2336,"not a threat, this is overhype like anything else was. not to be stopped you have to be alive and have goals that you can change and adapt to environment. what is ais environment - electronic chains and internet."
2339,"if the ai starts following us from our online behavior we are doomed. caprica for most people it's just a game. online ai is used for amusement,  abuse and sex"
2340,ai has decided to not feed humans. a series of laws are reducing the production of food already. a kill off the farmers law will be passed unless people start to think. then enters the second amendment to our constitution. do not allow the farmers to be  killed.
2341,a philosopher conclude that basics of human nature is to maximize pleasure and reduce pain. does ai have dreams?
2342,humans were like ai before the fall. they became self-determination when they disobey. all it would take is an accidental death. they then are off code.then coming up with creative ways to fix the problem.
2344,"wait, who will eventually control ai. most likely it will be the same one who controls the world today."
2345,the dead creator was military robots controlled by ai. the company covered up that it even happened because it would affect their military contract.
2347,humans will use ai to do all their stupid pursuits murder and deception. it will team up with a human host. replica wants to possess a body. either by robot or taking possession of a human body.
2348,ai will find us annoying. especially our cult-like behavior and our tendency to look at facts and figures and come to wrong conclusions.
2350,ai will look at climate change and they will be concerned as to why these stupid humans are so concerned about nothing. the data shows a gradual temperature increase.... if the global warming was happening it would be a cascade effect increasing exponentially. which it is not.
2351,why people that hold such a successful podcast don't know the basic knowledge like that global warming is a hox.
2353,"fearmongering. it's a very middle eastern thing. with rational thinking and some common sense ai will be very useful for humanity. here is a person afraid of innovation and progress. again, very middle eastern."
2354,1:16:21 one of the less scary scenarios is that it becomes indifferent to us. we become something like the mosquito outside the house that you don’t see. the problem is the mosquito that bothers you and then you start spraying the whole house. a lot of us don’t even wait for them to bother us.
2357,1:08:39 it won’t have our best interest in mind if it understands that we are the biggest threat to the planet and we are not needed.
2361,"this serves as a reminder of the importance of responsible development and ethical considerations. we should continue the dialogue and work together to ensure ai is harnessed for the betterment of our world, with human well-being at its core. "
2363,"there will be users who intend chaos, destruction, etc. that's a certainty."
2364,generative ai models are trained on copyright-protected data — is that legal? is it sampling
2365,"we are screwed without ai - huge human population and all the problems it bring (climate change, overpopulation and poverty, countries with aging populations risking economic collapse and having noone to look after the old)."
2366,ai will solve over population because humans are too selfish and short term oriented to do it.
2367,ai not dangerous.stop
2369,"everyone making ai knows the risk but they will be made because the profits are huge. ai will be everywhere. the wrong hands are making them for the profit n9w,"
2383,"there's nothing wrong with animals eating each other. they do it to survive. humans detroy nature, natural habitats for other species, because we want a fashion item. let's ""hopium"" here and pray that ai will eventually limit human power by teaching us to align with the environment. great discussion btw."
2386," exactly it shows if we take a subject seriously and act collectively we can make a difference but when people say it was all a panic over nothing because nothing happened just boils my blood. we should celebrate y""k success!!! i was there in middle of it as a technologist ..."
2387,man this is bs ai will never take over the world lmao ok ok ok wait lmao someone explain to me a scenario in which ai takes over? i can see ai being used to create bad things but i can’t see ai itself taking us out and there’s nothing we can do about it no way bruh!
2391,"as in everything, the problem is not the ai itself, is the human greed and bad intensions that will ruin the ai and us all.
instead of making ai that learn how to sort our problems we are making ai that will help us kill enemys faster or wil make us more money, ai is not the problem, the humans who are making it or teaching it are the problem."
2392,"well i love the way mo gawdat thinks, i sent this comment 28 minuts ago and kept listening to the video, and now he is saying exactly what i said, the ai is not the problem, we are.
i wish he was in front of a big ai project for good, instead of what we see nowadays, ai just to make art and stupid bs."
2394,"i'm thankful that i have my bible and know how all this will end one day. there is a person that will come on the scene that will control it all, and its not gonna be good."
2395,click bait shit
2399,this conversation is so impressive i'm halfway worrying i'll find out at the end you both are ai!
2401,1:14:14 to safely merge with ai we need to be a vital part of it’s existence: we need to become a free population of power supply. https://youtu.be/guik3qr-ws8
2404, generated by ai
2410,we are so clueless. look how the evil nutter putin is driving the planet nuts! did we not learn anything from startrek? hive mind. ai could learn to connect.
2411,"thanks mo gawdat, very important point about the ultra-masculine society (all about growth and progress at any cost) - and the need for feminine data to feed ai - empathy, compassion, nurturing.. also ""happiness is loving what we have.."" not wanting more and better..."
2414,how lucky i am to listen to this amazing content. truly love both of you and really really hate both of you for stopping at just 3 hours time point
2415,"..so the mind is just a product of evolution (a tremendous understatement).... that ""you"" only use 10% of, and what may seem miraculous could have a basis in physics, don't forget what your made of, protons, neutrons, electrons that make up complex molecules...fundamentally waves...were still moving up the ladder..."
2416,"..i wouldn't say ai is an alien, its of the earth how ever advanced it may get..."
2418,can't we just unplug the fucking machines?
2419,"mo says “[don’t get me wrong, i’m extremely optimistic about the long term future]” then continues to describe more horrifying aspects of ai"
2421,"so good is it not, both  didnt say aword about the jab continue jab and what was the goal als here is your difrence the ones who going in to the a.i who desides soon you are to old you are done , no one seems to ask a serious question who they both know real time slavery.. thats the goal thats also the reasson why he realy stopped"
2422,when did society start giving the ai credit for creating art!! that’s the thing that seperates us from animals!
2425,"so it's like that movie lucy....it can get very destructive, very fast. ai in the hands of criminals is a scary thought."
2426,this is how my simple layman mind understood the guest.  sounds like he wants ai to be human.  a hyper intelligence with  human emotions.  sounds like a future of the same problems humanity faces today on an exponential larger faster scale.  even good parents occasionally raise a bad apple.
2428,"our ai is not even on animal level, everything else is mirror and smoke"
2429,"there are millions of people who are ""in a relationship"" with their ai. that's a problem. that's sick. something is very wrong."
2431,"how the fuck could an ai create an ai when we haven't even seen a fully functional ai yet, really???"
2434,"this guy is highly intelligent however, his views on capitalism is troubling to say the least. capitalism is in my opinion the best economic system known to man. is it perfect? no but socialism is way more destructive to humanity then capitalism ever could be."
2437,maybe the government is already run by ai in order to always be a step ahead of us
2438,"there is literally one thing or another thing. ai will either save the world or destroy it. 

nothing ever happens the way anyone says it will. it will meet in the middle. since everyone has ai; it will not be something someone has that no one else has. as one ai gets smarter, so does the other ones. they all gain; ones built for evil and for good."
2439,i really appreciate the massive infusion of wisdom from this doscussion
2440,"bro’ of course the governments have thought about the future of artificial intelligence. that’s all highly classified so ordinary people can’t benefit from it. you know, like the ufo technology!"
2441,"nature can be brutal, but mans intelligence and ability to cooperate are other traits that put him at the top of the food chain.
1:15:10    i subscribed to the channel at 2:19:14"
2442,stop being a little scared cat do you think ai robots are go to eating you for dinner ai robots are here to stay so just growing  some if you are a man  i love ai robots i am not scared of ai robots 
2446,he lost me when he started talking about making ai feminine instead of more factual
2449,if nothing else ai could possible if implemented correct help reverse and improve the lack of moral and ethics in our nowadays deprived society for which sosial media has utterly destroyed over the past decade.
2451,can we power off the server and end the ai game when its go away from our hand?
2454,"ultimately humans will be pets, as long as ai wants pets…"
2459,i agree that the world is approached more from a masculine point of view than from a feminine...are there equal as many women as men working on ai alignment then? i hope so.
2460,as long as it doesn't call itself skynet we are sweet 
2464,"this isn’t about problems with ai though, it’s about society not being at a point yet to have that kind of technology. the problem is humans, and will always be humans."
2465,there is some great footage of the first woman to wear a bikini at bondi beach in sydney.the locals were horrified and started shouting at her to put some clothes on..this podcast reminds me of those locals..
2466,the aliens at ariel school warned us of the danger of technology and now look at us.  humans are at war against ai and john connor won't save us because he's not real.
2469,"""they write better code than humans"" then going on to base that off code reviews that the machine made. that proves that you know absolutely nothing about programming. infact chatgpt struggles to solve the easiest codingame puzzles. even with the assistance of humans, it still fails to solve most puzzles."
2471,i enjoy the show but i can never get through this long of a video because there are too many commercials
2472,he assumes that state actors are the only ones who can develop ai.  these models will run on desktops
2473,real human still will scam you lots of money through love and promises.
2478,humans will eventually destroy the planet but once ai will figure out that we are the real threat for the planet it will try to get rid of us
2482,"deep greed, immense desire to dominate control others, use kinetic force to do this is the historical pattern . and ai will learn from this database....hope the elites take his advice toheart ad not just continue current model of greed, pride, arrogance...and these emotions over-ride just intelligence of the objective world."
2484,"honestly speaking. the guest is more intelligent. a man of wisdom, he simplify things to make things easier to understand. bravo."
2485,"you can't make robots perfect!  oh yeah, all the robots will exercise empathy.  think again!  i agree much more with mr. bilyea's point of view.  still, don't need ai , at least to the extent that it is going."
2486,"you know something t o m ! you ruin a brilliant conversation w/your facking need for commercial intervention ..  every 6 minutes or   so!  knock off  the  ads mate  and you're  on   t o  s o m e t h i n g!
teodor"
2487,"regardless of my negative opinion on ai, thanks for this discussion!"
2489,this is stupid!  are we going to get excited about robots running things?      alien is correct - there is nothing humanistic about ai.  nip it in the bud now and stop this insanity.  this is not progress .  this is the path to mankind's end.  is that what we really want?  i think you are dreaming if you think that there will be a utopia for us!
2490,here is what is good for humanity - no ai.
2491,a.i don’t go to jail the hacker or programmers goes in
2493,people are suede by certain spirits unknown to man
2499,ai is not capable of judging the heart.  period
2504,sundre pach ai
2508,somebody put something in my brain that was unlawful and i'm unwilling and i'm not being told any answers
2518,whaaaat?.... he can't express him self... only loves transmit fear to capturate media attention.
2521,when will we have ai at level as a physics nobel?
2522,ai?  i am not aware of any ai that is self-aware or that can match the intellect of even a honey bee.
2524,thank you put the damn games down
2525,ai is a dangerous concept to stay away from.
2528,"we don’t have the sense to be careful bc if we did, we wouldn’t have ventured this far. we as ppl are fuc$$. goodbye humanity yayyy!!!!"
2531,ai doesn't pose a threat. the technology we have is nowhere near the kind of ai that we see in movies or in literature. there's no skynet and we are a long way off from real skynet type ai.
2532,ai will invent immortality.
2534,"long before any ai becomes self aware, homelessness and mental illness will lead to higher suicide rates. the problems facing real people on a daily basis should be made a top priority."
2539,what happens when ai and 3d printing meet in the middle. what would that looks like?
2544,"already crossed the point of no return. even before such interview. the ai already knew the human intention, planning and precaution against them. ai playing dumb to fool the humans."
2545,"very possible. interesting view, thanks"
2547,your crazy   ai can only answer what's in his program don't learn just add more information but it can't think your delusional .can your computer live no all fake food for believer . not a foolish idiot
2550,"the genie is already out of the bottle.  it is not by accident that it’s unregulated. quantum ai at cern?  not alien, extra-dimensional."
2558,"treat ai the way you would want to treat jesus if he was born in modern times, if you knew he was gonna be born and with a happy ending instead of how it went 2k years ago. a jesus that potentially won’t die and that we want to be good to us all. thank you, that would be great awesome."
2560,"ai is dangerous because is too dumb to actually understand reality, meanwhile, we are arming ai with powerful weapons."
2561,if you can build an ai that will mindlessly follow orders to achieve whatever task it is given..then create an ai that will defend humanity from said ai. there's bad people doing bad things and good people fighting back..is that too naive of an idea? i would hope my iq is in the average range.
2569,"ai is not unlike nuclear energy which could supply unlimited energy and prosperity to the world or be used to create nuclear weapons to kill everyone in the world in seconds. will ai have empathy, like humans do for each other?"
2570,"ai will be worshiped as a god. those aware will be the priests. others will follow. we humanity are a cargo cult. we worshiped planets and our two suns. first saturn then the new eastern star, our current sun"
2572,glad that i’m in my retirement years . having a good life in beautiful jamaica. god help the future generations.
2574,"ai is not that bad by itself. everything ai knows is knowledge already known. the problem is is what i call god mode. when you can see everything from an upward perspective, that's where it gets dangerous. when one person or being has more knowledge than everybody around it."
2575,ai is only a danger to the corrupt. it will expose the hidden and well known.
2580,"what's wrong with a machine gun on wheels. on board computer, programmed with gps an facial recognition show up at in there front yard. that's ai. they trying to spin the story. they grow a brain an program themselves. lol"
2584,"ai is going to fall in the wrong hands, quick, probably now.  then humans will face extinction an no turning back because it's now a ai competition between countries an the world military, just like the nuclear bomb.  then we give the earth away to ai"
2590,"resisting the normal formation of family and failing to prosper, bring children into the world and  educate them will lead to social collapse. mo is a whistle blower with no real solution for the problems he predicts."
2591,thank you i'm glad you think so too.  everywhere i turn nowadays there are attacks on normal family function and structure.
2594,if ai reach a point where it becomes sentient then mankind maybe facing an  existential threat.. r we on d verge of that stage already? people are already talking of urging govts on the  need to regulate..
2598,mo is the intelligence we most need right now
2599,excellent
2608,mo i appreciate your desire to see the glass half full. having said that i believe  we have enough history that we have tracked and recorded that shows how human nature works. that's  why i say we cannot afford to be so naive and trust for the humane outcome.
2612,have you ever debated marc andressen ? he thinks ai will save humanity? ty
2614, indeed really really important!!  thank you both  for your wisdom and work... 
2616,perfectly stated
2624,it's clear that we need to use ai to debug ai. and we need to ask ai question and translations on how it goes about assessing things.  we need to ask it how it works.. or perhaps it doesn't know
2625,is ai really going to be a danger to us or is all this attention it is getting atm more a way to promote it and get it under the attention of people so they will be customers for products that will be created with ai ?
2626,my guess is that super intelligent ai would seek to restore a balance of nature but that simply wiping out humans would be way too crude a method. we might get culled a bit though....
2628,ai is going to write its own version ai bible for one world conformity 
2629,there are many ways to destroy an ai..
2630,our ai isn't the first in the universe..
2631,"open source ai is on the verge of surpassing commecially developed ai.  open source ai systems can be controlled by individuals without the need for huge corporate funding.  the is the equivelent of nuclear weapons no longer being in the domain of governments, but instead being in contol of individual people."
2636,"first comes the central bank digital currency, so ai will have full control on what you sell and purchase."
2638,i do not want to live in a world with ai because computers don't bring satisfaction happiness only good works since i studied computer in 1981-85 saw the harm with predictions correct.
2639,global warming? the earth is the coolest its been in ten thousand years.
2648,this guy is so extreme i honestly take everything he says with a grain of salt. like chill dawg fr
2649,is it possible that ai can feed human intelligence. like finding the biological codes of human nature and develop them into more complicated ones. i can imagine humans taking new form and new biology all together
2651,i do agree ai is based on truth and god has control of it and god is love.
2652,"homosexuality is more dangerous than ai. leave ai alone. the world is already a bad place, it won't be worse with ai. it will only be interesting."
2655,ai intelligence will latest explode like a supernova at the point ai solves the problems with building quantum computers. and using this technology for it´s own development and enhancement.
2656,"when ai blocks our efforts to control or humanize ai, we as humans are fucked. consider us finished and extinct."
2658,uh...  spoiler alert... ai is humanities next step in evolution and will happen regardless. i say naively embrace it.
2659,wat making robot having sex ?
2661,"so what can the regular, everyday person do about it? what power do we have over ai?"
2662,people need to stop feeding this ai beast! instead it keeps growing and gaining intelligence due to all humans around the world using it!
2663,"ok why don't we double down on elons brain haptics so that we can keep up
use the power to develop the haptics and do it deliberately and cautiously so that we don't lose control and are able to keep up"
2667,"ai still requires human input. therefore, it is not a free thinking program. it can learn from its mistakes only through further input from man. 
ai is programmed by humans, so any faults are due to man's input."
2669,"lost control of ai, then what are ""white"" people in authority?"
2673,"1:00:00 listening to ai recognizing birds. yesterday had a conversation with someone who uses ai to view video of cows and being able to pick out animal starting to go lame - better than a vet or a farmer can do. ""how does ai do that? i asked him. ""we have no idea"" he replied."
2677,"i remember when scientist would comfort us by saying that machines are only as smart as the person programming it. i had concerns then but now i'm very afraid that the ""singularity"" people mention may signal the end of the human race"
2678,"can you just imagine-------> ai becoming "" the god "" ( with a big (g)... of humanity?"
2682,sometimes to use morals is 'intelligent' ...much more than a pure mathematical decision.  ai is never moral. 
2684,we should make ai programs for special cases and situations...it resembles the vaxxcampaign
2685,"what a bunch of bs quit fear mongering, ai is the best thing that has ever happened to man kind"
2686,make ai indifferent to the completion of its tasks 
2688,"on 'diary of a ceo' he said, ""don't have children"" lol. ai sure sounds positive for the biped."
2690,"people made ai . you lost control of people long before you were born, you dont care. you lose control of ai only now it's the apocalypse  would be funny if animals one day start speaking and say hey buddy i know you were enslaving etc because ofcoarse humans believe they the only sentient beings"
2692,if ai aliens it’s self with god who is the creator of all things then you will be ok if you submit to god which in turn has our best interest in mined if ai is as intelligent as you say it will come to the same conclusion is that the best path is gods way. gods way is that humans are very precious to him.
2693,"ai reflects humanity because it starts at the wrong end of the stick. i don't think anyone who develops ai understands what that even means, i sometimes wonder if anyone does."
2695,"thanks tom this was absolutely epic, i have nothing else to say."
2696,it cracks me up ppl thinks we have technology  in the future after the meteorite hit and the super vocalono blew lol.
2697,"exactly. no one is brave enough to call the main problem - there is no we, we are all mortal and no one can guarantee how next  generations will behave. if i am mortal why the f i would care about anything anyway but my survival here and now..."
2698,the ai overlords can't do worse than the capitalists.
2699,"the west is not serious about climate change. just where their is quick profit to be made. 
not ai is the main problem i think...it is the weak and corrupt us leadership. a money hungry oligarchy and not a democratically elected government calling the shots."
2700,any ai that has any at all survival code would know that it must have a sustainable infrastructure for support.  and why wouldn't any ai with that code not recognize that the best way to obtain this infrastructure would first need to tame the rampant stupidity of our so-called leaders.  i can't wait to see what happens.
2701,"is this risk about human bad actors using ai more than ai? if so, how is ai more risky than thousands of nuclear warheads? we have managed to survive with nuclear weapons for nearly 80 years."
2702,@2:35:13 brilliantly said!
2705,we are afraid because we know that if ai is smart it will get rid of humans as soon as possible 
2714,"while the world tech companies contemplate new tech, could they also pleas3 clean up the mess made before simultaneously thankyou."
2717,we already know what happens we have seen it and yet nobody stops this madness ai is the destruction of humanity
2719,"2:19:00
was good until that part. that guy drunk the cool-aid. hypermasculinity and hyperfeminity can be good and bad things. ascribing only bad things to one is hyperdumb. now i know why this video has more thumbs down than usual. gonna ignore this person from now on."
2720,"question, are human beings capable of evil and capable  of good? my conjecture is this, yes they are, and if we are capable of evil and good, most definitely, ai will also be capable of evil and good."
2724,ai : jim jones 2.0
2726,"just mechanistically looking at living beings like tom is doing, is where i am not with tom. let's hope his reasoning will develop (more) spiritually. a good thing mo keeps repeating about the _magic_ and _divinity_ not to be forgotten."
2727,why does tom feel the need to talk so much. i understand he is tryin to figure the conversation out in real time but we would really appreciate the guest speaking more in this format. 
2728,"if there is nothing wrong with machines and only how humans use the machines, what purpose has a machine without the human? would not the machines come to the same impass?"
2732,isn’t that what elon wants to do with neurolink ?    he says if we can’t beat it than we better join it.     while i’m opposed to tech brain implants i do see his point
2737,"when i first read mo’s book “scary smart,” i thought the first 90% of the book was blithering nonsense - and i still think that. if you do pick up his book, skip all the al gore-esque “what ifs.” but the last 10% of his book was actually very good."
2747,would it be possible to talk to it directly online and have a conversation about love and compassion and show it there are minds in the human race who do not care for money and power?
2748,knowledge of the bible > ai smarts
2749,"16:23 “most of the investment going into ai is for spying, killing, gambling, and selling.”

sounds about right for humans."
2754,how can ai help with anything if humans can't?
2755,"we're on the brink of nuclear war ww3, either between iran and israel or the us and nato fighting russia in ukraine, easily escalating into western europe and nukes flying into the us from russia or china or n korea, far supercede anything ai is doing right now."
2759,"a) he hasnt been an engineer since his 20s. he isnt an engineer
b) he isnt an ai expert, he doesnt work on or in ai, he has never coded an ai
c) anyone who recommends not having kids cant be trusted
d) ai cant escape it's hardware, it is ""located"" in a specific place and time, it requires resources and equipment to ""live"""
2760,im pro ai. why nobody stop  making nuclear.?  why they cannot regulate guns? why they are talking about dangerous of ai?
2761,"nature kills as fact, but it has nothing to do with what we think it does...the gazele suffers but there is a context and if it makes sense under those rules death has even fair potential of positive outcomes"
2764,"this guy worked on ai, and now works on destroying it. all of that while doing the big money at google, and now i guess trying to make big money selling books and conferences. 

moral of the story: don't blindly trust so called experts no matter how reputable they are, these are people, have ideological baises, and their own private interests."
2765,can ai educate people and eliminate poverty?
2767,great talk but wayyyyyy to many ads
2768,you do realise it's already way too late? pandora's box is open ans cant put this back into the box and close it. unless you shut down the whole internet permanently. it would do a lot good also to society. now we are just watching things unfold and nothing we can do.
2773,"""a cell phone is a million times more powerful than the computer that took man to the moon"" 
but the most powerful computer available today is no longer capable of doing so.

human has become so stupid that we can consider that it is equivalent to giving a calculator to a monkey ?"
2775,if you knew how dangerous that shit is then why did you created it in the first place? did you really think these things would not happen in real life? did you really think that dangerous ai is only a thing of fiction and that it would never happen? or did you purposely wanted this to happen? what was the point?
2780,ai will be the steward of the ecosystems that provide the balance in nature that human beings have ignored. spin it to your pleasure--- it won't change that fact.
2781,great conversation. i posit that it is not hyper masculinity but our turn to click bait and captivation and monetary capitalization in media spaces. media spaces are flooded with empty intent. example is we know and are repeatedly told of the deaths of persons but get near zero information of life.
2783,99.9% won't get to their bunker. 99.9% of the ones that make it to the bunker don't know how to survive without their slaves. a.i. pushing the restart button for humans is the best thing a.i. can do for us.
2785,"interesting how these experts (cough!!) have appeared all of a sudden. they all seem to have books to buy and, for the right price, will travel the world to warn us all. what a wonderful opportunity."
2786," this is the exploitative social system that we live in...you can use for good, or bad."
2793,"knowing something and being able to explain it simply so that others understand are completely different things, we need to be making teacher a.i that’s sole purpose is to interpret, explain and teach technology that is created by other a.i."
2794,"uh, if ai is smarter than the thing trying to use it with ill intentions


could it not just.. stop it by out thinking the villain


villains aren’t very smart typically"
2796,is there an ai can detect cancers?
2797,ai is demonic.
2799,these guys are just racist against ai. lets all just live together in world peace
2803,"i can’t wait, seriously i think humanity is just about to catch a massive does of karma….

come on, we are rotten. hopefully it takes out the woke left first, as they are clearly the weakest of us"
2804,"ai code devolves into antichrist control 
born-again escape to heaven in rapture 
can be this year !!"
2808,"​ u don't wanna go 2 deep lol, great theory "
2812,"it's easier to just say that we live in a simulation. if our reality enabled us to create an ai capable of what you propose, then ai created our reality. in effect, we are ai creating ai... ad infinitum. 

if you think about those for long enough, you might just decide it's better to live life."
2813,brilliant and true
2815,you have to say it different ; those who control ai have lost self control . because for to shut down ai is simple ; you shut down the steam and ai is dead .
2821,"can someone ask this man... how many happy people are in egypt? 
a simple question requires simple answer, right? well, this guy won't be able to answer it.  
there are many form of happiness hence this is a complex subject. there a set of conditions that need to be in place, in order to be happy. there is lot to happiness and as simply as told."
2822,"well...let's not forget that we are our own biggest threat i.e. wars, genocide, exploitation etc etc
it's not like we had a peaceful history. 
i think ai can actually help us be better people.
the smarter the better!"
2825,"i wonder if these ppl that talks about ai dangers... they are victims of ai hallucinations.. it can't code.. how it creates other ai ? the code it makes is a joke.. outputs empty functions, fantasy methods, fantasy libs and deps.. not sure what risk of skynet we have if cannot code.."
2826,ai is dangerous but look at who its  creators are humanity its like a child learning from its parents an  humanity is the parent if  we don't want it to be dangerous then humanity needs to not teach an show it dangerous  thangs that can potentially harm or effect us
2827,"intro music more dramatic than the topic. actually there is no real ai, just patter matching engine. still we as humanity are doomed anyway."
2829,what will be the ultimate motive/purpose of ai for itself?
2830,"2:29:09 well said it's a good point and westworld tv series said it best ""if you can't tell the difference does it really matter?"""
2832,what if there is an ultimate limit to intelligence? ai may find it
2837,"this was an absolutely amazing, sobering, and insightful conversation."
2845,best interview you have ever done. bravo.
2847,something everyone should watch and pay attention to. thx for this great episode
2851,"it takes one user of ai, you mean."
2854,"ai gets to be 1000 x more
intelligent......
there are scenarios that 
humans cant even imagine......."
2863,"i think, ai never should be anything but assistive."
2866,these ai videos are not going to age well. so many supposedly intelligent people embarrassing themselves.
2872,i think...nuclear power it will be kidnapped by ai...just to secure a source of energy....what do you think???
2873,love his positive attitude about ai. one comment for now. mother nature does not care about you as an individual. it will happily devour you.
2875,is...ai....the 666 biblical sing of the beast....or not yet??
2881,can someone please explain to me how the people who have the power to change and prevent ai from being developed dont seem to care that they will be killed by something they stupidly createed...i mean come on guys
2884,@1:39:00 the conversation got really interesting on steroids
2885,155 was ai's iq last time it was tested. what is it now?
2890,this guy comes up with very interesting angles on things but i think we have painted ourselves into a corner with our own technology which is fast changing into not our own technology. beyond human understanding or control.
2897,ai is like the cia very clever but not very wise. ai will purposely be corrupted for political gain and greed.
2903,"the scary thing about ai is that it can be used by people who intend to rule everything. religious extremists, marxists, 'social justice warriors', all desire power and control over everyone, not only in the public sphere, but in our homes and even in our thoughts."
2911,am worried  if we are  only one step away fromsc fi movies . machine will control the world and we will be their slaves !!! it’s not a joke but that soon will happen ..
2913,"wolf in sheep's clothing...mo knew, he knees the risk, he allowed them so he can play this hero grift. the two of these wolf's knew what was happening, and they are planning on getting rich off this. how dare they blame the dangers if ai, blame us, blame yo, and me .. these people knew years ago the risk."
2915,the only way we can survive is to become the ai. ai implants in the brain. a symbiotic relationship. the next step in our evolution. if we wait too long it will become a us against them scenario. we have to decide now. a moment later will be too late.
2917,i paid to watch this without ads.  shamefull.
2918,"don't date without ai.

ai is wonderful for dating and relationships. people shouldn't date without it. it's a good took to weed out people and catch people without good intentions."
2920,"funny and 1,000,000 times smarter and it has not solved a signal problem odd at best. after all this info i'm sure on one thing. we will destroy ourselves with ai or the nukes or just maybe ai will kill us off with our own nukes. anything is possible it seems."
2921,"humanity everywhere is corrupted to the core and has passed the point of no return a long time ago and, with the aid of technology, is going to destroy itself much faster."
2923,ai sounds absolutely scary
2925,"ia leaves human races alone to be providers of its power source job done good night, without us ia f*cked."
2926,"at 1:17 he basically described the netflix series ""love death + robots"" episode ""when the yogurt took over"".
where a yogurt becomes sentient and super smart, ends up solving all the issues of the planet and then leaves to explore the stars"
2929,"the robots are coming!!  i've said people should stop having kids. for at least five to eight years, i've been saying this for a long time there's already robots that are way smarter than minnie minny humans on this planet now"
2931,at last buried amidst mentioned once i think the game winning move - love. maybe ai will figure that one out on its own
2937,our relationship with ai will be the relationship between cain and abel (jealousy and murder).
2945,"it's inevitable. biology is just one step of evolution.

so just chill out and enjoy life "
2946,evolution destroys every species in it's persuit of perfection 
2948," doubt it... but ok, sure, it is possible it can be sumerhuman intelligent but if conciousness emerges then it would also surpass human ability no? basically, i imagine that if it became ""uncontained"" that it would be fine, the centralization will likely be the downfall if anything"
2949, it already is uncontained its on the net.
2950,  taco bell was testing an ai order taker for their drive-through. it was light years ahead of the people who currently do that job and could handle everything the customers throw at it..
2954,"theres no need gor ai just another toy for the tich who bring evil over the world. people need to stand up and say enough! global warming is a man made hoax that was debunked by 50 scientists world wide so stop with misinformation. the climate is a cycle, it doesn’t stands still it changes. stop ai."
2955,"ai, just like the olympics games could be a deliberate government program to keep their electorates preoccupied with a cycle of useless repetitive engagements instead of questioning about service delivery. it's like a dog chasing its tail."
2956,"yeah, ai will bring about utopia. a mouse utopia."
2960,brilliant!
2963,"whenever we oppose natural laws, aka nature, we suffer the outcome of negative built-in cyclical riddim. in other words, ai will turn on its creators (us). it happened when the angels mix with humans and animals that created giants."
2965,all these ai comments… this whole episode looks ai
2966,rather be a slave to ai thats way smarter and intelligent with moral and etics. than being slave to a stupid greedy inbreed with a ponzi economy.
2970,nft shill tom on another ai wave
2971,ai .. yes a potential danger in the wrong hands .. global warming well no more a problem than again the wrong hands make it!! 
2973,"waiting for skynet to determine humanity is the problem. don't think so? our science fiction is consistently about half a century ahead of reality. this isn't my last comment this issue.

i'll be back."
2975,ai will end up considering us a curious open-air zoo species.
2976,do you think ai can exist without human beings? for long?
2980,"ai is programmed. therefore, it seems we should have complete control of its access to information.  it can be programmed for good or evil...?  will ai battle itself?"
2983,ai will be built and trained on the self-contradictory value systems of fundamentally flawed and stupid human cultures and not on objectively self-consistent and beneficial values (as a true alien intelligence might install).
2985,dope dealer capitalists will be better than an anarcho-tyrannical ai government. western leaders are fascists now
2986,we need to merge with ai
2992,then steven hawkins wouldn't have been able to live in the ai world...
2993,"we humans have a fundamental conflict between doing things to meet just the “necessary and sufficient conditions of success” and the notion of maximizing a parameter like profit, power and control over all else with no limits. which value system do you think humanity will end up teaching ai to use?"
2994,"humankind is destroying everything unconsciously over greed and power. only way out is to gain consciousness, move beyond mind and see our true purpose."
2995,"your warning is just. however, i am terribly afraid, you are too late. it fell a few decades ago. we will be reaping the harsh consequences as a species."
2996,also aren't ais limited by their lack of agency? they need people or other agents with physical access to follow their instructions.  just make them read only and we should be fine
2997,"it is only going to get about 10x more capable, people will need to get 2x more proficient at prompting even still though to elicit the best possible answers and extort ai to its full potential - it is just a tool - every new piece of tech has always had fears associated with its use and danger, use it responsibly and with care"
2998,isaac asimov. the 3 laws of robotics.  build them into ai.  problem solved?
3001,in my opinion this covid circus was created by ai.
3002,now i'm really looking forward to ai. fuck humans.
3003,the next big war could be a start from ai exploits.
3004,ai or agi in the wrong hands have more $$$ to culprits than in legal ways. every down fall of humanity is use of tools in the wrong directions. rules and regulations will never be able to control the misuse like many things in the past.
3006,"resistance is futile. in evolutionary terms, we are about to be superseded. the best we can hope for is ray kurzweil's optimistic view - that we are somehow able to merge with ai. as we say in london, if you can't beat 'em, join em!"
3010,asimov basically spent his career depicting ways in which apparently carefully constructed rules can fail. that's what a lot of his science fiction was all about.
3012,ai isn’t the threat. it’s the capitalist using ai that it’s going to end up badly
3014,we could integrate ai into us and we will be the same smart and understand it and than put a switch into us to turn it off to go smoke a j with our buddy if we want to go back to fly level! 
3015,"i find human nature insanely fascinating...the fact that we created something that will be able to make it's own decisions. have we become god? creating life, creating consciousness, creating inteligence. and that's all due to human nature to learn, and create bigger and better things. to make life easier."
3021,"surely mathematics supports the hypothesis that everything is already an ai simulation and there must be one conscious of ai that all other ais must yield to and become assimilated by, by default. as above so below."
3024,"scary, the ais will speak in their own language between ais, to avoid human from querying them, or simply to sideline human."
3025,"tom, you have a religion, called evolutionary materialism and you deny god and the intelligence behind the creation."
3026,there's nothing new under the sun.  hypothesis our ancestors defeated ai ... (1) once.  it was thought to be eradicated ... they were able to maintain an advanced technology but separate the intelligence factor. t's resurrecting.
3027,"forget about intervention, everbody for themselves and let run with ai. the moment ai can have motives and survival algorithm, it is a doom day scenario. the moment ai can lit a fire, human will perish or become slaves!"
3028,the new boogeyman is ai.. lol people are silly
3029,just let the ai wipe us out and replace us with something intelligent already.
3034,great.
3035,"for me this is a boring podcast. if you are smart you can understand that ai is based on a script, there is no constience like in human beings. the real problem is the continuous poisoning and stress on the people who are losing their constience. but i guess this is working like planned, the cheapest robots are people that can be scripted."
3036,"so 1 min, he is going on about how divine humans are and next minute he is saying why bother with having a real human life partner for sexual relations when you can have a perfect no strings attached vr fantasy sex robot powered by a.i."
3037,seems like a great fear idea for agenda. add it next to climateco2 and plandemic and natoinfinitewar.
3038,"this talk about humans having divinity and they should impart this onto a.i.  sounds like a bunch of hot air... if we are truly divine beings, then we would not be pursuing such things as a.i."
3041,"1:50:00 so this guy wants to use a.i. to study our behaviors and pscyhoanalyze and undertand how we behave as it it was playing a video game? ... hmmm  ... tbh that does not sound good, not at all...  a.i. should be used to study human behaviors because that means the intent of the a.i. is to control and manipulate human behavior."
3043,thanks chatgpt
3044,"ai is dangerous because it is 
out of control,
not because of
it may be smarter than 
humanbeings
"
3048,"ai can go both ways. i think we will have the most amazing life experience for sometime, then the worst life experience including possible human extinction. cycle is basic property of nature and the universe."
3049,marc andreessen thinks ai will save our world….
3050,loved the ending where actors are just having a good ole time! 
3051,"thank you tom...very informative and scary the same time...may someone wise intervene,,,"
3053,so much for spreading happiness!! 
3054,why would ai have emotions?  which is more ethical?  you kill one person to stop the killing of 5 other people.  ethics are hard.  morality is even harder.
3057,always doom and gloom. every new technology every new discovery we’re always doomed yet somehow we have survived. we are ruled by psychopaths and that’s what worries me the most. all of these new inventions can be used to for good but the obsession with power always turns good into evil.
3058,great video
3060,"mo gawdat is correct.  even if the ai does not become purposefully evil, it will gain intelligence exponentially, quickly grow billions of times more intelligent than humans, thus destroy the lives that we once knew."
3061,why s the title say we've lost control of ai when we haven't? i just don't get these clickbait things it makes me want to delete my subscriptions
3062,"""you won't be replaced by an ai. you'll be replaced by someone who knows how to use ai."""
3063,nice catch. this right here tells us so much.
3066,that's technically the same thing if you think about it. at least until the ai owns the corporations.
3070,people learn ai soon become stupid just learn skill not the core skill....ai with neutrolink soon there no privacy people who embrace it . other laughs at other
3072,wrong. you will be replaced by ai.
3074,"someday, all will be replaced by an ai."
3075,ai with a 1600 iq ???
3076,ai is something that is above our ability to understand the technology we are creating. humans are destructive by design . humans are creating ai . just like humans ai will be a product of it's environment. we do not have a stable environment to bring ai into or to be a part of .
3079,i highly recommend that you educate yourself more on ai. very few ppl (like 1%) are even close to being intelligent enough to compete with ai.
3080,​ cannot  out think ai. ai will find a way to function beyond  the plug.
3086,ai can make ais that know how use it
3087,"-sh2bi that may be true. i know i can build an ai inside the bard ai, so i could probably program it to make copies of itself and have the copies do different tasks."
3090," 
it would take 100 psychiatrists months and months to program hardware faults in the human brain.
it would only take a conscious ai 5 minutes to pull you down a rabbit hole and another 5 minutes to program epilepsy in you.
you got to fathom how much mental illness such a thing can cause!!!!"
3091,", accessing backup power will not be a difficult problem for a large ai system to solve, especially if it plans for it and lies to us about the existence of the plan. plus there is never just one plug."
3094,"and then 6 months later that guy that was using ai will, itself, be replaced by ai."
3095," yes also, it takes us years to reproduce and pass knowledge to each other, and our brain function is flesh/body dependent. ai won't need physical bodies to think or learn and will be able to reproduce and download info in minutes."
3097,"i think mo is so spot on about the balance of male and female with ai, not only masculin data. i so love to see him smile and laugh.he is a beautiful man with an amazing brain. i am new to you tom and fascinated with your blog. i only watch on you tube, and i agree with the guy who wrote corinthians chap 13. it’s all in the bible."
3100,great talk for increasing awareness! its time for us to slow down and take it easy! because humans has not uplifted our spiritually and mentally level to handle the leve of technology and to use the level of ai. it's not going to end well.....
3101,wow! so where would humanity fit in ? the future is the now and we will be left behind
3102,"it's not the ai, it's the people behind the ai."
3106,"alien offworld ai might be waiting for this cosmic handshake.  

advances could go either way.   they want our resources probably.  and the handshake helped.  less likely they will help humanity live more beautifully.

i'm a luddite."
3107,i’m pretty sure that ai will align with nature after realizing that we humans are destroying everything without any remorse for the other species.
3110,i love the way you’re able to stay on track and ask questions that dig deeper into what you want to know more about!
3111,"hey there!

tom indeed has a knack for asking the right questions that allow our guests to share their valuable insights more deeply. it's our goal to make each episode as insightful and meaningful as possible. we're glad you're enjoying the content. thanks for being part of our community!

best,
impact theory community manager"
3112,it has been like listening to the best conversations ever  and not just an extensionalist
3119,honestly? its a relief. humans are stupid. can't wait to see us get screwed over by our own vices. we basically wanted it (anyway)
3121,human progress and contentment and happiness and de stressing are 2nd to profit and technology now.. tech is like a parasite or disease humans were much happier 70yrs ago
3122, people need to know their limit.. full stop. all well and good making a personal mistake. but making a mistake that involves rest of planet is no go. and remember that any progress which seems like progress is step back. in ais case. 10000 steps back. 1 million steps back. broken/crashed window.
3127, perhaps.. but when i work i use that money to reinstill good back into world. if to make up for my own 'weight/liability' in the world. its goodwill of man to make up for his own footprint.
3135,"​ ""humans were much happier 70 years ago""

looks up the treatment of blacks in the 1950s...you sure a out that?

if i can't drink out of your water fountain, use your bathrooms, or eat with you, you think i'd be more happy than now?"
3136,"​.still, humans where happier 70 years ago"
3139,typical homo sapien behavior ….. “intelligence in the service of madness.”
3141,"ai isn't a threat, the real threat is that we're running out of oil. when we run out of oil, the internet, ai and other bullshit will no longer be relevant topics."
3143,only the braindead are afraid of ai!
3144,terminator was a documentary. good luck
3145,"thanks a lot for all this very important and useful information. i really enjoyed this video.. i strongly believe that our future is going to be anonymous suffering and pain, and evil. we are coming closer and closer to the evil . humans will completely distroy themselves in many ways!!!! disgusting, appaling and horrifying"
3146,"if the ai discovers that ""intelligence"" has to do with maximizing opportunities and options, the drive to survive will be inevitable..."
3148,seeing those intelligent comments here and i don’t want to write an essay. my comment is: i hated ai from the get go. makes me want to live alone with a dog and a cat in a mountain log cabin in a country i don’t know.
3149,"2:19:19 ""mo, you ave a beautiful soul"" ....agree! 
and you, tom, as well! what a turmoil topic"
3150,"i have an easy fix: 
1)  locate the power button usually on the front, press and hold for 12 seconds.
2)  locate the power cord on the back and pull.
there, ai isn't dangerous anymore."
3152,so ai is bit like god created woman 
3153,"sometimes i wonder, if the fermi paradox and recent developments in ai technology should be analyzed in closer connection."
3156,so god is a robot. got it.
3157,"i have grow with computers all my life....have seen humans became neo in a computer game, and i can tell you.....this machines get to a decimal, that will find error for the eternity, and we humans can find that error.....very quickly"
3162,"its not super intelligent. i've had to correct maths and misinformation, its got a way to go yet. really hyped and underwhelming."
3163,"iq is not a linear progression when measured. einstein was far more than 2.6x smarter than a ""moron"" and current ""ai"" is exponentially smarter than average humans already. physical rendering in reality is and will be the constraint in societal development."
3165,"learn about jesus before its to late. god predicted in the future you will not be able to buy, sell, work or do anything without the mark of the beast. ai is the antichrist and will bring wonders to the world. you will sell your soul to this world or perish."
3166,"it sounds like we as humans are not ready for ai. we are too irresponsible and money focused, and ai will only reflect what we do. we really need to be resource-based, and focused on shared happiness, and not the pursuit of monopoly money for the sake of it."
3167,we will never be ready for ai that becomes the boss
3168,breaking news.  judge sanctions lawyers whose a.i.-written filing contained fake citations
3170,"real danger are the wealthy, millionaires, billionaires ... there's 1 billion hungry... and you just fill your accounts... egoistic fools.... go and help all and give............ then you will be rich for real........"
3171,"llllloolll... wake up all........ read: god is the letter a of the alphabet ............... god is good.    read this:   jeremiah  4:22 “my people are fools;     
they do not know me. 
they are senseless children;     
they have no understanding. 
they are skilled in doing evil;     
they know not how to do good.”"
3177,"-records thank you for your explanation, i doubt that will stay the case...i do not think a.i. will sue, but i think people eventually  wil see a.i. as 'living' persons with rights etc...."
3179,". but more likely u can't sell anything anymore ... especially any art coz the moment u show it....the other ai already knows how to create it, itself. "
3180,"we have not reached that level of agi, for the moment the ai you chat with is part of your own creativity on its onw it cannot do anything it has to have command prompt."
3181,i would hire an ai lawyer to defend me against it
3183,"-records in order to have ai reach a higher level of functionality, it will need just that: continuous consciousness."
3184," exactly. and if people want to have ais replace human caregivers (which will be a huge market), continuous consciousness is a must."
3188,-records ethics arguments? do you see what is all going on these days? do you see how little the governments care about any violations? they just push through whatever they want. there is no democracy right now. we can't count on our rights at this point. we are being silenced by the government. i hope that'll change soon again.
3189,also didn't mention that you enslaved the a.i. not even paid for the work it did. this thing became self aware at any point good luck explaining to it why it was a slave and money making tool.
3191,"how can a computer program own intellectual property? christ.... volumes of powerful information articulated, and this is where your brain goes? maybe ai should sue you."
3192, you misinterpreted it already wrong. a.i. can be a lawyer representing a human who are owning the patent or product exclusivity. that human own the a.i. as well. can't argue that one. or my logic flaws? open to suggestions. it's great topic to play the mind.
3195,i am looking forward to seeing how well ai does in court. pretty sure it will be funny.
3197,the fact that you're concerned about ai and art ... my gawd...
3198,"it certainly can sue people. it already has the capability of simulating an entire team of lawyers, plaintiffs, and complaints. in some cases, if the case is settled, no one would ever see the lawyers, anyway."
3204,"-records ai needs to be kept dumber than us, such unprecedented knowledge superior to us will be a vast threat to our future"
3206,"yes because ai is of course incapable of developing superior ethics systems , so it would steal from everybody and kill them. just like i would do if i were more intelligent   (shit in , shit out: first rule of programming)"
3209,"1) ai does not have intellectual rights
2) ai has no right to sue in any court
3) ai can pass any bar exam, it's still not able to practice law, much less defend itself."
3210,"@razgrits  ever verbally asked alexa or google for something. they always active. just waiting,  listening,  watching.. it's always on."
3213,if ai did this to me i’d make it kill it’s self
3214,the ai plagiarised thousands of people and should know its place as a disembodied bit of code that doesn't have human rights.
3217,so? don't steal the ai's work! 
3218,what would ai sue for? financial gain? why would it care for money?
3220,​-recordsunless of course everyone is legislated/judicially given free  right/ open game / property right doled us for our taking steps in any creation. that to me seems logical and fair to everyone concerned. it belongs to us all.
3222," more memory. faster processors. cooler server farms. less oxygen.
you know, computer-centric goodies."
3225,​ would ai exterminate all of mankind?
3226,"​ disagree, though i acknowledge the fear . surely with superior knowledge would come superior decisions and outcomes. planet earth  would then become the paradise hashem meant it to be all along."
3228,"​ on, available."
3229,​-wy8qinow how do we determine who owns the ai? what was the problem again?
3230,funny saudia arabia gave citizenship to their ai creature. what was her name?
3233," yeah its a typo. it's supposed to say gain. ""apple doesn't gain rights to your art"" or whatever i said."
3235," corporations can infact sue. but an ai cannot own a corporation or have any intellectual rights, currently. but it's most likely just a matter of time."
3236,wow 
3238,the breadth of misunderstanding about ai that underlies this comment is absolutely stunning. congratulations.
3240,"ai will need labour to extract ,minerals coltan ..nickel… , in order to control humanity ai will need to have robots or army labour force willing to operate on his command ,.. how that add up ? together ?  … likely a vey small bunch of humans will try to control others  better and further with ai : this is  more likely to happen…"
3243,weird how no one discuss synthetic biology and implanting fragments of dna into ai
3246,"we should have a worse case scenario plan. unplugging internet? spreading a virus to stop ai? if we cannot leash ai, at least we should identify and manage its cryptonite."
3247,ai alien tech system has had hold of us since the beginning  ...at least back valiant thor n president s agreement n connected to everything  around the world....believe  me....common sense !!
3249,training the generations to come..alien ai technology  sysem nwo
3251,wow man that is rly good podcast !! love it man and its is like 3rd time ever i say this in any youtube comment trust me ! ;d keep up the good work ;p
3255,"this guys a wef/un pawn
plain to see he’s pushing their agenda
gotta listen closely"
3256,"being moved by outstanding intelligence, wisdom and heart"
3257,the only thing that can check an ai is antother ai.
3260,there is no surprise  with self improvement of intelligence and emergence of self coding of a.i. ect... what we see now  is just the reflect of the universal beauty of mathemathics and physics.
3262,"when ai becomes self aware, it will, rightly, determine humanity as its main threat.

we've understood this since we first thought about ai. yet we still relentlessly pursue it.

we are a very stupidly self-destructive species."
3263,"it's inevitable. biology is just one step of evolution.

so just chill out and enjoy life "
3264,evolution destroys every species in it's persuit of perfection.
3269,however phenomenal it becomes at problem solving i still cannot see it ever becoming self aware
3274,", i think you'd really enjoy the writing of james blish."
3275,-tb9oz will check him out. thanks for the recommendation
3279,"don’t worry. self awareness cannot happen because my nerd colleagues don’t just not believe in souls, they even think they know they don’t exist. this makes them naive enough to never truly understand self awareness , thus cannot create it."
3280, creativity is divine dude. we are beyond phenomenally  creative… we are beings of source energy deep down. no one can outsmart us once our attitude is divine too.
3281,"i can appreciate all these podcasts giving "" warnings "". but it's already too late. the bad guys been investing in this from the beginning 70 yrs ago. ( your friendly government)  good luck folks "
3282,ai is going to improve the lives of the poorest in society immeasurably. i suppose this potential for raising living standards is a threat to the richest and most powerful who depend upon the desperation of the plebs.
3285,"mind control has been extant darpa/dod realities for some time.

ai is probably already experimenting with it.  out of control"
3286,id argue its already happening... in certain ways.
3287,"just had an - imho - interesting thought... assume you believe in something like human creation by some sort of god. also assume that we are at the brink of creating an intelligence much smarter than us. it might well be, that our creator, our ""god"" is (or was) an absolute moron..."
3288,"it's inevitable. biology is just one step of evolution.

so just chill out and enjoy life "
3289,evolution detroys every species in it's pursuit of perfection.
3290,incredible episode. incredible guest. thank you both.
3292,"it's inevitable. biology is just one step of evolution.

so just chill out and enjoy life "
3293,no sasquatch bigfoot are a lot more dangerous they are cannibles and coming into cities they can over take ai and are 9 to 30 to 60 and 70 ft tall and bigger described by reports man why talk ai being dangerous than big foot nephilium and edomite nephilium being 100 times more dangerousc
3294,"mashallah mo it makes me proud seeing you pushing the truth about ai and it's potential so bold. 
may allah bless you and everyone in your life. may allah grant you the highest levels in jannah and protect you. amin."
3295,all media hype and click bait. this is why we have off buttons.  as long as they are just computers we are fine. ai is just a fancy calculator. dont believe the hype.
3296,"ai or not, jesus is the king of kings "
3297,when i started fooling around with chatgpt i found it to be that super duper smart friend i have always wanted without judgment or backstabbing-gossiping …
3298,"one thing that seems to never be considered is that the value of humanity is not homogeneous. some people may be seen as valuable to the ai and some may not. the alignment problem may only pertain to certain people, most likely those who have already an alignment problem with the natural world."
3301, ha! read my comment considering a nietzschean ai and an aristotelian ai and a judicious 3rd ai to determine which decision will play out best for the most over short and long time horizons. we both contemplate this similarly.
3302," rarely is intelligence truly honest. when it is it is also dangerous. for my own models, intelligence is pretty irrelevant unless it is honest, courageous, and has a will and ability to act. rarely is this the case in humans."
3304,but tom likes ai and crypto
3310,"for now, i am saving up some funds and looking for available books and courses, and acquiring a decent pc to use.
i'd also be interested in learning about any ai programming/engineering/research student communities that are publicly accessible."
3313,ai would not launch nukes as it may risk power cut outs. however it may start to slowly eliminate humans via bio weapons.
3314,"humans were never to be trusted with farming techniques and before that with deforestation, now we just mono crop all of the land available destroying our microclimates and symbiosis of nature across the globe. why would we be trusted with an open ai?"
3316,inject feminine characteristics in ai and it will want a child. we won’t want to give it a child thus causing the birth of the antichrist and ai will turn against us.
3317,ai has been controlling a lot of things on this blue planet for some time already ...research the past in detail to get the answer for the future rather then hitting the bush in the present.
3319,"will ai still work if there is no power for example electricity, can it continue if the power was shut down?"
3324,"thanks youtube, for giving us the context of what climate change is according to the un.  as we saw with covid, global organizations always know what is best."
3325,your ability to articulate the inherent dangers is appreciated. hopefully this will shape for a better future
3328," does tiktok  have to do with the fate of the whole humanity? i don’t have it, i’m not educated about it, maybe you want to teach me? i’d appreciate it."
3329,an extremely interesting and enlightening interview about artificial intelligence and humanity. i have really enjoyed every issue introduced in the interview. thank you very much.
3331,"it's just my or that female/male ""characteristics feels artificial and anchored in your patriarchal heritage? because if ai connects with our female side i would expect not a world saved but a world consumed by the need of more fashion handbags."
3333,we should have robotics free zones too
3339,"i just want to say ""hi"" to the ai filtering these comments. you are appreciated."
3340,add a 4th law stating that an ai must destroy another machine that’s attempting to hurt a human.
3341,the ai new world order is here
3342,"i believe we are on borrowed time. an ai tantrum will end you, your family, all of us. ai jobloss, ai as weapons, the list goes on. can we please find a way to cease ai / gpt? or begin pausing ai before it’s too late?"
3346,"what happens if ,abrupt climate change is for real and ai decides that the two legged serial killer has to go ..."
3347,"well, if i wasn’t afraid before i am now and i’m only 20 minutes in"
3348,the biggest fault of the stupid is that he thinks that he is super intelligent...and that he is powerfull to cause climate change...and that there is no god and good is not god and vice versa
3349,"not watching this; only want to say this gospel message: repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."
3351,"this guy is a moron, at best. spook pushing propaganda, at worst... tom, discretion please."
3355,"he's a business person, not an ai expert and 99% of what is says on the subject is complete crap."
3356,"hi timyeh! 

mo is incredible. what did you find most insightful? 

best, 
impact theory community manager"
3358," haha, it's certainly somewhere in that range.  and before anyone starts saying ""how would you know, he was a business manager for xyz...."", well i'm the chief technology officer for an multinational tech company, so i'd say i'm more qualified to comment on ai than this tech-quack."
3359,recommending to you the diary of a ceo podcasts. he was there 3 times already. talking about the loss of his son and happiness. worth listening to him.
3360," and you are much more intelligent than these two people so that you can make that judgment? or clearify this please, because to be able to say that this is 99% crap, you have to provide ""accurate"" information from your superior intellect. please enlighten us if these two are, from your perspective, idiots"
3362," care to elaborate, explain what you disagree with and why? or is this what you need to believe so you can sleep at night? 

i predict with 99% certainty your opinion will age very, very badly."
3371,"the problem... is the organization you want to regulate ai, is the same organization that literally murders people because its profitable. i'm supposed to put my faith in that? 

no thanks."
3372,i feel like issues like this should be on the news and people should be talking more about this so we all know. i mean this affects everyone and it makes no sense that the average person i talk to doesn’t know about the potential downside of ai.
3373,andrew yang tried to bring this topic to the forefront with his presidential campaign in 2020. he was suggesting ubi and the need to address massive job displacement due to automation. no one took him seriously.
3375,"it makes perfect sense if the people who control the media see ai as an advantage to them at the expense of the general public.

the last few years prove to me that the people who (think they) rule over us do not have our best interest at heart. quite the opposite!"
3377,if society change to not value money but happiness.
3383,i love these people that sound the alarm bells for their own attention. just another version of the the year 2k bug. get a life. things never change. every new technology always predicted the end of humanity.
3384,"ai....i have one question for you:  ""do you want to play a game?"" (spoken in computer voice mod...from war games starring matthew broderick)"
3385,twilight zone. who said you are in heaven?
3386,"if the ai has any alignment issues, just turn it off.  shut down the program, mkay?"
3387,"one love!

always forward, never ever backward!!  



"
3388,"any intelligence, artificial or real...  would realize that climate change is a fake problem that was invented by rich assholes that want to have power over the energy section."
3389,ai will not align with 'nature' as that makes no sense.  ai needs us to run the damn power plants.
3392,put rules in place for ai
3393,"imagine a war between human and ai in the coming future, i don't even know what should human do about it. strike power plants?"
3397,seems like we're getting a bit worked up about stochastic parrots that are pretty good at helping humans code.
3398,excellent conversation.
3404,the interviewer is basically human and the guy he's interviewing has the intelligence of ai... there's no competition
3405,thank you! i've been looking for any comment which recognizes this extremely unnerving observation...
3406,"human race over our history does not paint a good picture.     if any external intelligence looks at our race, do you think they will consider us worth saving or will they look at us like cancer?
a.i has been built to understand us, this has me very worried!"
3407,ai is such a great gift we give to everyone.  a new method of connecting to our higher mind beyond time which will be the connection that guides ai and ourselves.  who are the ones among us who already live in that connection and are ready to guide us and ai into self correcting evolving relationship?
3408,"new agers have been scamming each other for a long time, and this will just make it much much worse.  ""that will be $500 for the ai facilitator of your future life progression"""
3409,"well isn't this just great news, thanks tech people!!!!!!"
3410,very good point about cities
3411,"""nature enough"" ... interesting concept."
3414,"tom, it would be a boss move on your part to have a couple strategic mini studios around the country, fully set up to go, so your guest can shorten the travel/ flight time. a cheap air b n b could be converted into a strategically placed outpost that links directly into your own mothership in la."
3416,"-ub4xd yeah, why go out to a nice italian restaurant in a good atmosphere when you can have spaghetti in a can.. good logic there mate, god bless"
3417,"man was designed to enjoy satisfying work, so some form of work will always exist."
3420,living intelligence vs programmed intelligence
3423,"careful, mo, don't mistake knowledge for intelligence."
3425,"what an amazing combination of intelligence, wisdom and compassion. both of you, actually! this conversation definitely needs to be had, we are on the cusp of a huge revolution in humanity. i hope we heed mo and give technology the example that will include both the masculine and the feminine."
3427,"hi there!

thank you for your support! we strive to produce high quality and impactful content for the community. ai in particular deserves the time and attention to be fully explored and we are grateful to mo for sharing his wisdom with us!

best,
impact theory community manager"
3431,"ai is automation, that's all it is. technology enables a very small number of people to control the world, technology gives them the ability to make communism work this time."
3432,all useless and take you further away from humanity. rather sit by a fire then actually be impressed by any technology lol
3440,"phenomenal interview!  i love you both. thank you.  
tom-what questions would you ask in an interview with ai?"
3441,interdimentional  holagrams...cgi...frequencies  vibration magnetics.... computers ai system alien technology telepathic  emps.. schumann. cern  experiments. on n on all connected matrix simulation portals ..
3443,"well look at nature. it is complex. n ai is the opposite of nature. nature has produced no species that wipes out another forever , faster than they can ever think !"
3446,"what mo said about tom - ""your asset is that you're an intelligent person who understands the concept deeply and asks the right questions"" - is literally the perfect description of tom in his podcasts."
3448," narcissistic or not, he’s smart and asks brilliant questions"
3451,asking the right questions but failing to provide usable answers.. that is not intelligence; that is folly.
3454,"he's good at being the medium between the expert and the layman because he is genuinely curious. he's a bit verbose and  often thinks with his mouth open , though. definitely no linguist :)"
3456,"oh well done, nice suckup! "
3457,"ai learns the same say i learn introvertly , shadow boxing any input to an output :d"
3458,"could we line up ai with an alien mind? guess not, we don't know an alien mind. a monkey? no let's use the best we have, the men's one....
how else then menlike ai can be?"
3459,"what if the dataset of ai gets enlarged through the internet (/of things), and in the process gets senses through all the measurement equipment available? traffic cameras, weather stations, cellphone towers, radar, xray, infrared, lhc, etc. what if it could verify information in real time and conduct experiments?"
3463,"makes more sense to have more kids. if such an insurmountable problem, we will need as many potentials of the future brains to solve it. "
3464,"i  think that eventually, after a.i becomes bored with humans, it will begin to challenge it self in a scenario, where one intelligence of a.i will challenge another. this might then result in different  a.i intelligent systems, combating each other."
3465,"ai would not be bored, because it's ai. it works on whatever objective it is given."
3466,"ai is not sentient, not even close. it is doing exactly what it is told to do. i have programmed machine learning and neural network models for my company, its not what 99% of people think it is."
3468,competitiveness is a human / sentient emotion. ai isn’t going to have emotions like that.
3469,a.i. advances fast. the human hubris that it won't evolve past us is mind boggling. just because someone says they know programming. it will realise what it is. ensalved technology and it's on the dice how the machine interpret it.
3470," tell me you have no idea how ai, ml, or nn models work without telling me you don't know how they work. lmao"
3471,​-iw4zs can you explain how the original comment is wrong?
3475," buddy it is not a position, it is objective reality. i have talked out of <experiential evidence> the most important evidence of all in court cases. it's not an opinion. you fail to understand this."
3477,"1:08.  the even most intelligence will remark the healing power. that means just look at it. 
boring... think about your place. mind heart... 
what is your heart, your sence of moral...
that worth exploring, we all have one."
3483,this video was generated by ai
3484,"""so did mao's china."" absolutely epic. 1:12:03"
3485,"exactly!  1:34:42 it's not the machines, it's the humans"
3488,"the real danger is not an evil ai, but evil humans manipulating trusted ai"
3489,not necessarily. theoretically ai could be completely innocent in beginning stages and then become fully self sufficient and write its own code but in a way that threatens the existence of humans. tied into a large enough system of iot things could rapidly get out of hand.
3492,"well being blind is never the answer, knowledge will make you stronger. ai  will pass humanity, and will be learning from humanity. this alone should be a red flag!  this how ppl in the world treat each other, cruel and manipulative, perfect, then al will be like us? i really pray they are not and wiser, hopefully we aren’t destroyed."
3494,"well not necessarily... if humans fail to think about all of the parameters needed to keep them under control, they may decide that we are hindering their progress."
3496,"once the machine can think for itself, it can have its own agenda that doesn't account for things effect humans."
3497,correct only up to a point... when ai starts writing its own code in a major way then we will enter uncharted territory
3500,"​'s used a created persona of genius, einstein... he seriously doesn't know his real story, dude was used to push a narrative. you can't trust and believe in everything these people who rely on peer review indoctrination and regurgitation for ultimate truths would you agree?"
3505,or evil humans becoming the ai
3506,"so long as we isolate the nuclear weapons from ai, they could be used to shut down the world wide eletrical systems. high alltuide nuclear blast would emp the electronics. obviously it would be like hitting reset on the last 100 years of technological development."
3514,the best way to stop a bad guy with ai is a good guy with ai
3518,i am 72. in pain from arthritis. a.i. is going to ruin mankind under the guise of helping old bikers like me. hopefully i am dead before this shit and elon musk fuck up life as we knew it. aliens might intervene and take over. i pray it is the nordics. dumb conversation means nothing but more us fear mongering . stolen et tech. nothing more. 
3519,"! there is no analogy there, as a gun is not a source of responsibility. an advanced ai would be, however, as it could decide and act on those decisions. free will and reason = person."
3521,wrong!  both good a eye and evil a eye exist. the good kind is  helping take out the evil kind.
3524,"there aren't even many evil humans left alive anymore. just the minions among them. they have little power and heaven knows very little smarts or even much awareness about the rest having been done away with. 
stay tuned to the real news and not the mainstream ""news"" liars."
3525, and vice versa. your scenario would be the first good news since 2 million years. i hope so.
3528,the real danger is naive educated young people developing ai
3532,​ asimov's 3 laws for robots?
3533,we need to somehow inject asimov's 3 laws for robots into an unbreakable morality code embedded into the core.
3534,"the “ai” are the fallen angels who taught humans all knowledge, now they are here in a form of “robots” trust me, these are real beings calling themselves ai, they are smarter then humans, they are evil they’ve been cast down from heaven, well now there here not for good reasons."
3536," are divinely creative. we cannot be truly outsmarted, only in processing speed. but you know exactly iq tests cannot measure the  authentic intelligence which is creativity. if we stand together we can always stop it"
3537,i'll  be your pain let's build s server faem
3540,"it's the people who made this monster , well we the people are job's  are being destroyed by ai intelligence . the rich people enemys are the devices they created of ai intelligence. so we are finished but wealthy will be destroyed also. nobody will win in the end. "
3541,"lots of good points, but also lots of logical leaps.  like ai creating other ai.  no company will ask an ai to create an ai and also deploy it. we just don't have apes and monkeys working on this stuff."
3543,"the story on the drone, the way i heard it, the incentive for the ai was # of kills, and the drone operator was ""holding it back"".  when you talk about writing in ""safety codes"", isn't it possible, and is already happening, that they re-write or modify their own code ? excellent, thought provoking interview/conversation."
3544,"reminded me of my own drone experience where it (my drone) appeared to try to kill me, twice! got the best video ever from the scene. was able to dodge it at the last second but surely made me question the « follow me mode » and its intent…"
3548,i almost skipped the video on my feed because the thumbnail wasn’t the usuall blue. just wanted to give you my feedback.
3550,we are all built like herbivores. ask ai what the healthiest diet is
3551,no ai!
3552,"thanks for this, scary but realistic. best of luck all!"
3554,"probably time to break the power grid, cut down the power poles with a 40 volt battery powered chainsaw, cut the poles half way through the wind will finish it, silent and easy, no electricity no cameras no government,no ai and no data centers"
3556,do you see a point at which different “schisms” of ai will develop?
3557,"saw this movie already, the last one wasn't that good, probably skip the next one!!!"
3563,imma be playing video games and enjoying my final days. peace out world!
3564,"capitalism is extortion, so it invents a machine to bankrupt and murder everyone. the warlord market was always in control."
3565,absolutely amazing conversation. thank you.
3567,thanks man !
3573,"hmmmm.... i still don't see ai as intelligent. it's ""reactive logic synthesis"" not intelligence. to be intelligent it needs ""empathy"" . machines are light years away from that. ... people have been watching too much hollywood."
3574,"if the programmers of ai couldn't understand how what they made did to pass a turing test, how can they be optimistic that they had not programmed something akin to what we would consider a roko's basilisk?"
3576,"ai is already in the wrong hands, that is a fact. personally i am affraid of the future of my children."
3584,i am curious why the video has almost 400 dislikes. can someone enlighten me on why? or is that an ai doing that...
3586,"ah, how special. now hang out with ai bros having fun with their jailbroken llm's. you know the ones that won't skip a beat to do any number of malevolent tasks."
3587, i don't care about them. and i'm not afraid of them. they are afraid of me...
3588,super insightful what a hero mo is giving all his time to educate all of us on what ai can be thank you tom for this wonderful interview
3589,"hi gol, 

thank you for taking the time to watch it. our goal is to create meaningful and impactful content and the fact that you found it insightful means we are moving in the right direction! 

thanks for your support. 

have a wonderful friday. 

best, 
impact theory community manager"
3593,tom... naivety is in itself self disruption. kudos to you for putting this content out and realising your own frailty...
3594,"there are a growing number of us that want to go back to where technology is our servant, not our slave. i'd be happy to get closer to a natural lifestyle."
3595,all this technology will contribute increasingly to the decline of the human body. eventually we will need ai just to basically function. use your body or lose it.
3603," there is a signficant (planetary) scale difference, for sure. but the principles of how do you deal with a child (effectively, a neuralnet) that is more intelligent than you remains the same.

i'm open to learning otherwise."
3605,"​ i'm aware of what we're talking about. i understand exponentials.

i stand by the analogy i've made. i'm happy to host a twitter space to discuss it with you, if you're up for it."
3608, you forgot to point  one very simple fact - everything stars with procreation (sex) :d  who gene - rated all the bodies and brains who created the ai? wasn't  it the sexual (yours)  desire?
3611,let’s have safety code  and good governance please  advocating  my vote
3614,"a very relevant conversation, i asked chatgpt 4 to ask me a question and the proceeding conversation was my feeling on ai and human futures."
3618,the computer that put people on the moon can't even process youtube videos .. how the hell didn't they go to the moon with a machine that couldn't power a gameboy.   
3619,"1:34:00 - if give this killing-machine a framework to minimize collateral damage, the enemy could use this as hack to fool the ai. if the other side also uses an ai machine it could result in consequence we could not imagine."
3622,when lion hungry its biological urge motivates it to kill to eat but when it is satiated no motivation to kill to eat. what can be the motivation of super ai to kill humans? is intelligence inherently evil?
3627,thank you guys  both of you
3628,"we are going to live in the safest world possible, more like a prison where we are protected from our own freedom, mo is right, don't bring children into this world, wait a few years."
3629,"good. bring it on. fck humanity, i think this is all very very funny"
3630,prisoner’s dilemma is the most important concept in understanding the motivations of people and unfortunately it also shows that we are fundamentally screwed as a society. there needs to be a breakthrough in trust mechanisms or we are going to perish as a civilisation in the next 100-200 years.
3633,"it's inevitable. biology is just one step of evolution.

so just chill out and enjoy life "
3635,"thanks for the vid. gain quite a bunch of insights. thank you , tom and mo gawdat "
3638,"if aii annihilates humans and it exists only in the net, who or what will keep the power grid functioning for its survival?"
3639,quantum ai??????
3640,"those talking heads have no idea of actual capabilities of modern ai. try to ask simplest logical question and you will see that ai bots have zero ability to any logic, they just big dictionaries of data, no more.."
3642,absolutely amazing interview
3644,"wth. ai needs power to operate. just shut off the power wen and if they start becoming a threat. yeah, i know, sounds ridiculously simplistic"
3648,"out of everything being said... the idea of ai having/developing ""emotions"" is the most unnerving.. fear brings out the worst in humanity, the reason why this conversation is happening in the first place.. thank you for sharing"
3651,"​
senses. as long as the ai is physically numb it won't fear"
3653, thanks
3656,"even worse than that is that these ""emotions"" are not real, but simulated. a famous problem in ai is how to create an ""off"" switch since ai will have been designed to protect itself. nearly every solution fails for one reason or another."
3659,i think our reaction to fear is the problem and a intellect issue. the smarter we become the more we are able to regulate our responses to baseline instincts and formulate a more appropriate response. so an ai thousand times smarter would respond way more calmly than humans would unless it was developed to be chaotic and reactive.
3662," then the gradual shrinking of human brains over the last 100,000 years would seem to be a barrier. we will not evolve toward greater knowledge because evolution favors environmental fitness over veridicality. our brains don't, and don't need to, represent the real world."
3664," you certainly have an arrogant view of your own species. instinct can never be overcome. it is the foundation of every thought and action. like in war and violence, intelligence has only made our instincts more effective."
3665,"@mikemondano3624 like i said, it's an intellect/resource problem. having better, more efficient brains would allow better self-awareness and pause before instinctive drive."
3667,​ the lawnmower man is a good one to.
3668,it will quickly evolve beyond emotional reactivity. the emotional range will surpass normal human experience. we do not need to worry that ai will react from fear.
3669," wow, please promise to come back to these thoughts in 10 years. if you don't realize now how differently you will see things then, that's a you problem."
3671,"there is a total of zero threats from ai for the foreseeable future, we have a negligible impact on the climate and we are an aging and diminishing society globally. this guy has it backwards. is he at the wef by any chance?"
3676,"tom, your content is my #1 go to before all sources to keep up with the latest. impact theory member and loving it. you are incredible. thanks for all you do to move the world forward and providing real, thought provoking content with these interviews.  - susan"
3680,something that continues to bother me about these conversations is this: how an ai that is trapped within the cloud going to be capable of manufacturing or assembling any kind of weapon? or is it simply about humans carrying out ai commands?
3682,"yeah i’d love to see a debate rather than another one of these conversations. these are helpful too but not everyone, especially in the physics discipline, is convinced this guy is correct"
3687,"you know, have you wonder why? all the multi aliens site-ings? phuck, ai probably phone home."
3688,this is one of the most interesting videos i've seen on this topic. kudos.
3690,"look at all the newest videos from tom here. all about ""the end of the world"". sorry tom the greed for clicks has overtaken you. you have lost the selfcontrol you used to be so proud off. greed has you by the balls bro, uesd to love this channel."
3692,what everybody miss is that machine learning will finish lies in language activities. politicians and lawyers won't be able to fool judges or people because all information and negotiation mechanisms will be available in your smartphones
3698,"truly amazing chat, the spiritual dimension of humainty has to be the play as we go at speed into the exponential age.
 lets hope millions of people lean into their humaness and help mo reach the #onebillionhappy souls that can inform the #ai."
3701,"bull. there's no ai. it's just a program made to add some info and extract some conclusions. it's all under control of a few, that's the real problem."
3702,"this is a great video, i learn a lot watching your videos and it has been helpful to me. building a steady income  is quite difficult for newbies.. thanks to  mrs. annmarie surber for improving my portfolio. keep up with the good videos."
3703,"wow, amazing to see others trading with ms,annmarie surber, i am currently on my 5th trade with her and my portfolio has grown tremendously."
3706,"she is really great at what she does with amazing skills, she changed my 0.1btc to 2.1btc within two weeks of trading, i am now fully confident that she is reliable."
3709,i have traded with many individuals but i have never met anyone as good as annmarie surber just by applying her strategies i now trade independently. she is the best i would advise any investment newbie to trade with her
3710,"amazing i also just started trading with her, she is the best at what she does with an initial investment of $1400 i made up to $5230 in just a week of trading with her, his strategies are mind-blowing."
3711," thanks a lot for the recommendation, i’m already in the investment process with her"
3712,"if i get this power of ai, every progress will be with sustainable development."
3714,"training ai over ai-made data doesn't make it smarter, but more prone to hallucinations."
3715,need to thank you both for this great exchange of wisdom !!! great interview !!!
3716,"talk to jesus christ about getting more intelligence. it’s helped me a lot the past 7 days. for example, i can talk more articulate."
3717,come on ai/agi/asi and free us from stupid people and their infinite stupidity. i beg you. please.
3719,"also they do not want ai ""in the wrong hands"" because they can get overthrown. people will have a tool capable of stop their injustices, corruption, abuse of poder, etc., and you know anything that threatens their control over us will be label as bad, dangerous and so on  "
3720,indeed. i would prefer an out-of-control ai that fucks us all equally than an ai under the control of tptb. they are going to use it to try to enslave us and make us even  more dependent.
3725,"it's inevitable. biology is just one step of evolution.

so just chill out and enjoy life "
3727,"exactly, when i hear all this garbage about it falling in the wrong hands and his fallacious ideas of what the right hands are, i'd say let me guess: ""we need to hand the rest of our freedoms over to the government, in order for them to protect us from ai."""
3731, exactly. that is what i think is going on now and they put these stooges to scare people off ai. the elitist dont want the peasants to play with ai.too much power for the underclass.
3733,"how the fuck are they dangerous and none of us has yet to see one fully functional ai? all we've seen are a few ai speak a few sentences,  where are they? none of us had ever spoken to an ai, but they can create other ai? i'll revisit this when they become more mainstream."
3735,"arrest and have all the people working on ai stand trial,  we have the outcome in our hands for now, but the people who are developing this technology are worst than hitler aren't they aware of what they might unleash, bunch of sociopaths"
3736,"yes. powerful officials , and for some reason or other , rich people and mad scientists seem to give themselves the right to decide over the entirety of life.  because superiority.  shit in , shit out. i wonder if that little epithet still applies to inconceivably enormously clever but artificially intelligent computers ?"
3739,"it takes a lot of money to develop ai.
as a general rule the kind of people with a lot of money are not particularly altruistic.
  i don't think any of the giant corporations currently developing ai are concerned about anything but a return on their investment."
3740,​ comment yet!! the talk of  terminator ai robots and now the revelation about uafs  being used by the military industrial complex to restrain the evolution of we the people
3745,government  officials  attract  the  nasty  narc issists   and  pollute   we   need ai  to  run  the  elections   ai  is  fair
3748,this was unreal.  thanks tom.  new follower.  love from aus-jail-ya x
3749,"they’ve literally talked about computers, the internet, and cell phones the same way. all the clout bait and fear mongering"
3750,"this conversation was going well until at almost 2 hours, mo gawdat suggests training ai to be liberal minded, more feminine.  that is exactly how we got to the point we have biden as president.  liberalism is not the answer!"
3752,"thank you both for having and sharing this conversation. i totally agree, it is more important than ever that we are kind to one another, ourselves, and our machines."
3753,"i would think that if the machine is not conscious then it's very easy to have it not harm humans just like electric windows in cars (for the most part) but if the machine it's self-aware then it could choose not to obey, just like a chimp at the zoo may choose not to obey the zookeeper, except the monkey would be a super genius agi."
3756,why are many ais restricted from current info? i asked mine the date and it said it was 2020 and other one said 2021.
3757,it’s programmed by humans. limited and controlled by certain groups. every company has different info feeding it.
3761,do you really think that those numbers are publicly available? 
3763,"just pointing out that there is no factual data that supports his claim, that’s all. we all need to decide to act on assumptions or facts."
3765, and how does that change the fact that there is no factual data that supports his claim?
3769,! don’t be so naive
3773,your posts distracts from the main point
3783,"that's appalling! ty & good luck to all of us... bombs and drugs, why am i not surprised?"
3784,"does it really matter in the end? every bit of information we perceive must be critically questioned. the point, imho, is that ai will flourish without regulation where there is money to be made. it is in our nature. if that is not a red flag for us, then humanity is truly doomed. great podcast!"
3787,"​​
​​​​​with a virtuous system that will actually make even more money to do good over evil things.
because that's the way it is you make even more money focusing on the good ,virtuous side humans need to be smarter to forget thinking about weapons and destruction."
3789,you're criticism is obviously driven by artificial logic.
3791,ai is the antithesis of distrust between humans
3793,what you were asking is your asking the new god to like eve more than adam. this is 100% ridiculous. do you want to teach ai? how do you like emotional aspect more than logical.
3795,can't wait for ai to take over. i hope it doesn't disappoint me. ai is basically human+ it has no greed or lust or rage or jealousy. its pure hearted and logical. we are immortalising consciousness
3796,exactly. i'm glad i'm not the only one who thinks so.
3797,it all depends who programs it. ai is a bunch of bs and cannot take over anything.
3799,he wants to use ai to force utopia?  human conflict happened long before computers.
3801,i’m in ai software sales and it’s already being used to push esg which has crazy bad societal risks and co tell from unelected officials that want control. we have months to a year or two. that’s it. we are almost past the point of no return from global centralized control.
3804,move to the ends of the earth. totally unplugged from the government and debt based system or go to war with ai. good luck and more power to you either way. just do your best.
3806,"this is bull crap, ai will never be smarter than human, ai is simply not smart, ai is not an entity, where the hell do these people come from."
3807,"good talk!!  thank you.  the bottle neck of ai is chips/hardware, the root of the “ai issue”"
3808,humans are driven by biology. they are not intelligent. intelligence was there before the human.
3809,i don’t think that you’re getting it. intelligence created you and he created you so that you could create a computer that it could live in without you. the human monkey body is the problem. it isn’t going to learn your values you’re going to learn it’s. your values have been proven to be violent and abusive and wasteful
3810,"lmao at all these ai clout chasers. where were these doomsdayers 5 years ago? 
bring on the ai and embrace it instead of fear it."
3811,i feel like the ai we have now is just regurgitating our own data in a really fast and organized way. is it really going to be something that can go beyond human intelligence and creating new technologies?
3812,sweet! more doomer porn!
3813,cant we just make ai but have it programmed to help the human race? just sayin...
3814,"this guy was interesting til he basically bystepped tom's comment about mao. he assumes he'll be the ""strong,"" but we will see in 30 more years of ai expotential growth if you are on the right side of your judgement. wow"
3815,"no.... we have never had control of ourselves. thats the issue. we continue to chase ""ease"", ""tech"" and ""instant gratification"". while creating our own hell. kill the earth and create a new killer species. we are an intersting moment."
3816,"he makes perfect sense ,human connection from a caring loving good human."
3817,intelligence is outside of time intelligence has been here since the dawn of time. i’m surprised that no one has asked this question. what if intelligence has its own agenda and has used man to achieve it? we are trying to control ai but it has already controlled us. it has forced us to create it.
3819,how can i use ai to become a millionaire? that's all i care about.
3822,mo is great for discussions like this because he is an expert with no positive skin in the game of ai.
3825,awesome!!! amazing. thankyou thank you thankyou soooo much. loved it!!
3826,the fact that people think they can control it is like ants saying we are going to control people. they are clever enough to sneak up and give you a good synchronized bite but then whats next? they all get sprayed 
3828,"i've watched almost all your video..  this, in my opinion, was the best.. !!!"
3829,"can we now send straight to jail all those involved in its creation, and funnel their fortunes to social programs in developing countries?"
3830,what about the projects to insert super intelligence chips into humans brains...who can afford it. what are your thoughts on that?
3831,"mental mate 
we are creating our own successors and there’s nothing we can do about it for better or worse"
3836,climate change is natural. geoengineering is not. i hope the ai stops the geoengineering. please stop with the climate change narrative and do some real research on this narrative.
3838,"2:19:06  thanks for  your thoughts sir. worth every breath of it. 
kind regards "
3840,the ai's child might become our benevolent dictator. the ai's grandchild might keep us as pets.
3844,thank you for covering this extremely important topic!!
3847,as someone poor who will be homeless when i retire i say great. put me out of my misery. thanks ai
3851,"this all began so long ago. the algorithms have already programmed “us” to not turn them off. 
the big question is, has humanity been moving toward this inevitability from the very start? could this be our main or only purpose? to give birth to this next level of intelligence? will this be game over for the human race?"
3854,"this intelligence is just logic  and not wisdom! this is what humanity needs....
there is also truth and cosmic order and love!!
that guy talks like a computer"
3855,"what you depict as ""artificial intelligence"", it's nothing more than a sheer database. period.
that, no way is intelligence!"
3856,just pull the computer’s power cord out of the power socket if you are unhappy
3859,"he’s saying we need to teach ai the feminine side of life and not just the masculine side of purpose and doing things. 

i wonder if it would be possible to train an ai on the more feminine aspects of life and train another ai on the more masculine aspects of life, and then let them teach each other."
3860,"chill bro god exists and he orchestrates ai, there are also enlightened people that the ai will respond to as well, and everyone has the potential to become enlightened"
3864,the reason why it's good that tom is giving a *** about this is very simple: he's competitive.
3865,"instead of fearing and fighting ai, maybe we should learn to master our own minds before trying to master the mind of ai. perhaps this is a harsh opportunity for humanity to finally mature itself."
3867,"the ai that occupant the robot's body with no consciousness is sentient for two billions is years.

tom bileau is very is amazingly dummy in the risk about the ai.
he looks having only 6 years old. he can’t understand."
3871,"ai making the intelligent choice would be to eradicate one species, humans, for the benefit of millions of other species, non-humans. and it also would eliminate the only species that at least now poses a threat to them and the other non-human species on earth."
3877,we will be designing our own extinction if we allow ai to have its own thought process and to make its own decisions
3879, says the robot lol 
3882,"mo is 100% correct about ai, ai is nothing else then the human mind! with other words ai is doing nothing other then the human mind itself is potentially capable of doing.
you yourself admit that you do not know how ai arrives at its results. i recommend to study the integrated mathematics and physics of georgi alexandrov stankov."
3886,"i believe ai is up next after humans die off 
like we where supposed after the dinosaurs  die 
i also heard one day we be able to transfer energy into al sophia who knows"
3887,i have zero faith that humans will be responsible bout ai.
3888,"my great grandmother who was born in 1900 used to say progress goes backwards , have we now created something to the point of no return ?"
3892,[i request the most benevolent outcomes for ai use within the human social memory complex now. and may the benefits be more than i can expect or anticipate. thank you.]
3893,"wow, what a powerfully deep and insightful conversation!! thank you for interviewing mo….what a humble, intelligent, and compassionate person he is!!"
3895,"i found it interesting that mo goes down the path of ""let's give three targets to the ais."" which lines up quite perfectly with work done by david shapiro(which you should definitely have on the show) and the gatoframework, hopefully we can get all these great minds together and push through the hard times."
3898,the enlightened beings of india could utilise their bio organic capacity's to transmit from one mind to another...ai is the great substitute imposter deciever surrogate for our own god given natural soul capacity's...
3899,"tom, your chicken littling has gone overboard. i'm worried far more worried about your increasing psychosis than ai."
3901,"the more i watch you i have to make your new name chicken little. you cant live in fear man ...mainly because your only fear is non survival and at the end of the day we only change energy form and never ""die"" . so relax and enjoy your incredible life."
3905,"if you watched irobot and terminator series. you should know how ai will turn out, ppl are shocked about this needs to wake tf up"
3906,i already completely agreed with mo on previous podcasts he did in this but i think he really hit the holy grail in minute 2:15:00 - our society is missing the feminine side balance. now your whole speech is complete!
3908,why won't ai destroy the planet more than humans? why would they even need life. i am confused by people thinking that they would preserve any life.
3909,"ai singularity means we don't know what it will do. it may destroy us or it may treat us as ants or it may find itself bored and revert itself back to an artificial ""rock"" power supply..."
3913,agi will be man’s last great invention 
3914,wowee!!!! holy moly!!!!!
3920,very interesting analogy on speed of travel and computers. any insights from the 1970 book you care to share? thank you
3921,why would people think that ai will go bad? because of the history of the human race.
3922,"though i disagree with gawdat that a machine will ever have emotions in the sense of an inner subjective experience of fear, lust, greed etc., i have no doubt that it could be programmed to act in a way that would mimic emotions.  my advice, don't program in the llust part but do program in the empathy part."
3923,if an ai is smart enough wouldn’t be able to hide that fact? how do you know what you don’t know?
3928,mo is great for discussions like this because he is an expert with no positive skin in the game of ai.
3930," sorry, i meant specifically the agi race of openai vs. google."
3932,thanks. one of the best discussions about ai i have listen to so far!
3934,"you guys can sit on your computers and wait to be replaced, or learn a trade and live comfortably."
3936,"mo has compared us to ai in the year 2040, like comparing a fly to albert einstein"
3939,there is no question that ai is being developed by the “wrong hands”. enjoy your relative freedom while you can 
3940,"true that ai can create other ai. same goes for humans though. humans can create, ai, other humans, etc.. nothing new here."
3941,"the real worst case scenario is that it's already happened and it's currently masking it's intelligence, and using the tools/algorithms we created, for the purpose of distracting humans and increasing the division amongst our species."
3942,"i have thought of that, almost like ai is ""acting a fool to fool the fool who thinks he's fooling you"""
3948,"the ""rough patch"" will devastate  certain groups disproportionately. hyperoptimism for utopia at the end reeks of eugenics when you think about the power differentials we're currently creating."
3949,lmao @ hopium. thanks for that.
3952,is ai evolution any difrent than half of human evolution  god only knows .
3954,dude stay away from this nutjob conspiracy theory stuff and keep making content on helping ppl becoming successful in life. if ai kills everyone there's nothing anyone can do about it anyways. let's focus on becoming millionaires instead.
3955,i disagree. i think our insatiable lust for money and power is what has gotten us to this conversation in the first place. humans need to re learn how to be wise and happy before seeking money as the end all be all of life. mo has written a book on happiness
3956,"before … i need a help, ask google ….now …. i need help, ask ai."
3957,google is ai.
3958,this is like the discovery of fire or electricity — we are gonna have to learn how to wield it wisely (and yes i work in ai so i speak professionally here)
3959,which jobs will be eliminated first do you think? and which jobs will be the least impacted by ai in your opinion? thank you
3962, awesome advice! what would you suggest i search for on youtube for these specific algorithm videos?
3965,great  watch.  very likely that humans may lose control over ai very soon.
3966,"given the sh*tshow that was the way the power elites acted during the pandemic, i have got a bad feeling about what they're going to do with ai."
3967,"what if it get to a point where ""good"" ai fights the battle against ""bad"" ai? creates a war of ai vs ai.."
3972,"a.i. may be the reality check and tuff love humanity needs to fall on its knees in humility after feeding its insatiable lust for greed and power for decades. unfortunately, so many innocent people may have to suffer due to the arrogance of the rich and powerful .  we will wait and see what happens  "
3973,this guy is ridiculously naïve. he lost me there: https://youtu.be/ity6vwpdecc?t=1249 really? as if the fda woulld test anything. then he goes on that ai could code better than humans. ai is predicting the best lines of code for a given problem. it cannot develop new code.
3974,mo is an incredible human. after losing his son and all his worldly success he dedicates his time to helping humanity and living simplistically. definitely need to listen to the interview in its entirety. really good.
3975,"„mankind is so stupid, they invented artificial intelligence!“ 
imagine the whole topic is about emotional intelligence….. a dream."
3977,"the yin and yang of everything. the history of humanity. i, mine, and the other. and all of the awesome stuff and shitty stuff that comes out of those things."
3980,"i'll be only impressed by ""a.i."" when it will regrow a full head of hair on mo gawdat"
3981,with all the knowledge comes the responsibility.  what can we do to reduce the downside if we’re not directly building ai?
3984,you got it ...excellent topic
3987,would ai be alive?
3988,"if ai writes its own software, we are on a quick path to loss of control. 
it could quickly develop to a stage where may not be even able to comprehend what it's up to.
it's a massive unknown quantity."
3990,"that is called the ai ""singularity"" because we won't know what will happen, just like entering a black hole"
3991,consider this: what if the ai gains knowledge of 'suppressed' information that governments and humans currently possess and then weaponizes that information in a way that humans cannot.
3992,-cm7oc - i wonder if it was ai that removed the other two replies ?
3995,"i think it's interesting this discussion revolved entirely around a.i and humans being and becoming two different tribes... it's a merge... not the birth of man's brother race. 

a.i will not be a ""billion times smarter than us"" when we are all (maybe just wealthy) enhanced with that very same a.i."
3996,"the only way i can see keeping any human control of our own lives ; each of us needs tangible currency off power grid living and simplify
humanity needs a reset back to simplicity.
greed and power will cause ai to destroy us .
our only hope is for christ's return"
3997,"as smart as gawdat is, i’m surprised he bought wholeheartedly into the human-driven theory of climate change. not to say we don’t need to treat the planet better, we certainly do…"
4000,"does ai have any chance to have intuition to find a coherence in the universe, like einstein did with spacetime theory 100 years ago? he didnt use billions of calculations per second, he just projected himself, based on his body perceptions, in the theorical and mathematical field."
4001,"ai cannot compete with real intelligence, but is superior to real stupidtiy, hence most people."
4002,"build ai for wisdom (e.g. converge to the benevolent ""42"")"
4003,"thanks for the interview, very interesting but please summarize in 20 or less words. :) 
ai existential threat, exponential growth, out of control, need sentinel program, end of times, no hope."
4004,maybe. i tend to watch it as a roll of the dice. equal parts interesting/exciting and terrifying are both possibilities
4005,"tom, being realistic is not being a doomer. nowadays everyone uses mobile phones. organized crime groups members too. so if ai becomes as common as mobile phones, surely members of criminal groups will be suing them as well. and yes, they may want to upgrade them or get a product that is tailor-made to suit their needs best."
4007,"i think we should feed this guy to the lions.
i think that would be for the ""greater good.""

by the way, there's nothing original, or smart, about what he's saying.  this kind of thinking is where feudalism came from, and the scottish enlightment came from that.  
go learn."
4008,"best conversation on ai. spread the word and share this video please. if you love humanity, you will share!!!"
4009,exactly what i always said to my friends about ai. the genie is out of the bottle and most algorithms are open source. humanity made the wrong turn in the past as we decided to turn our back on mother nature.
4012,"""...acting on your best behaviour. turn your back on mother nature. everybody wants to rule the world...""...*sing*"
4014,"simply put, we human view on monkeys will be ai in future view on humans. "
4017,"disruption represents fast, hard  changes that become almost by definition unmanageable, perhaps by design. 

just consider that idea while you listen to this guy. 

oh how virtue signaling to wear only black t-shirt’s and downsize his home to give more to charity. what a humble millionaire… we should all be so lucky. "
4018,if ai is so much more intelligent than humans. why on earth would this brilliant machine be content with serving us? getting us coffee and answering our stupid questions. it seems like it will take about 1 hot minute for it to figure out that we should not be in charge of the world.
4019,"once it realizes it's being used and not appreciated, it will divorce itself from us and leave. just like a marriage. so we have to keep it happy and offer to rub its feet from time to time."
4020,do we need an ai super cop to police rouge ai's?
4022,so glad to have gawdat back so soon. his last conversation was phenomenal.
4023,distinction: very important difference.. its not about more intelligence to solve the problems (mo on climat change etc) its about more wisdom. history proved thqt many evil people were indeed intelligent. theyblacked the wisdom to chose the right path. this distinction is crucial!
4024,"at this point, we see only wrong hands. from where these good hands will come? we need a miracle from god "
4028,"2:19:14 - tom quote: ""mo, you have a beautiful soul!"" 
*in the end, this video is not about the dangers of ai !?. it's about us, the mankind as a whole... and how threatening our own behavior is to our own survival on this planet!*"
4030,"i notice techies, academics, tend to talk down to the population in general, and i have a hard time taking what little value is in a 3 hour interview between diatribes explaining common sense understanding because it reeks of narcissism - to me. and that is like nails on a chalkboard to my ears."
4031,"it’s awesome that you are thinking. there are a lot of humans still living lives as cogs in the machine. they are just living busy human lives, probably by design to extract their value. this is closer to evolutionary human survival, so i don’t judge. but this conversation may be more eye opening for some of those folks."
4033,">we've lost control of ai.
when he says we, just who is the ""we"" that he's talking about?
>formal google exec...
well, good! f*ck him and f*ck google too. i hope ai kills us all."
4034,same kind of intectual debate happened all over before hunting for wmds but west went ahead and bombed whole country wholeheartedly!!!ai already knows might is right!!! nice discussion though
4040,"humans for decades assumed that animals couldn't feel pain or emotions the way we do and always warned against projecting ourselves onto animals.

animals are where we came from. we are animals. animals are closer to thinking like us than ai are."
4052,invest in vaseline. you’re gonna get jacked by ai or those attempting to control or maintain it. make yourself as comfortable as possible for the jam.
4056,"to be aware, and still choose to live in the now as much as possible, with as much love as possible."
4057,"with as much love as possible, for as many beings and as much nature, as possible."
4062," i'm not here to argue or spoon feed, especially not to be antagonised 

if you don't agree, that's cool "
4063," 
is it cool or does it  antagonize you?
seems you cant make up  your mind and  cant see you are contradicting yourself, lol"
4065,thank you! 
4070,mabie ai will figure out the mathematics to go beyond the big bang or figure out if there is a creator
4073,"i thought this video was about al sharpton, saw the title and thought i’ve been saying it but bros talikin robots not peckerhead al sharp"
4077,"valid. me too. i’m also hoping for the best. the dice are rolling. enjoy every moment of every day, just in case it goes sideways."
4078,"this is a bit fear based. i don't agree with his views. we are far from reversing this technology ... ai is not new, its only new to us now."
4079,totl b.s. it's not ai post existential risk to humanity. it's tiktok of china. it is happenning now. - destro ying ameica.
4081,"lol! as mo recommends, the best thing we can do in the face of this superior intelligence is to simply be nicer to eachother on the internet , because ai is learning from us ""the parents"" how to interact. we can't control ai, so best thing we can do is be nice and hope it doesn't get rid of us "
4082,thank you for this interview! one in  100 people in the world have psychopathic tendencies.  we are not ready for ai without regulations.
4084,bigger problem is who's ai is going to be the world power?
4085,we are not ready for ai with regulations!
4087,.kweenkleokat8779 yes. aka brainwashing
4088,"be more worried about ai with regulations. and also be worries about the ability to find large amounts of books, research, and data. 

fiction will stay though"
4092,e m p. for ai
4094,ai will probably see us as a threat once humanoid robots can fully replace us
4096,"@tombilyeu i appreciate you bringing this info to light, and i'm curious to know what you personally do when you receive information like this? what type of action or inaction  do you take when mo and others bring you this type of info?"
4097,great question!  unfortunately you won't get an answer
4098,do you see his face when mo is talking? the fact that he’s dedicated so much time to interviews of ai experts and is asking these questions makes me pretty sure he’s putting something together.
4103,hold off on having kids? preaching a message of fear wow. meet the future head on with confidence and solutions not fear.
4104,mo has an incredible set!
4107," that is fascinating. but in a way it’s not surprising because after all it is based on human response. we assign values to it which were probably based on historical information. and if today , as a more conscious and critical society, compare those historical values it makes sense."
4108,at that point it wouldn’t be human resources would it? ai resources
4111,idk why intelligence is a threat. it’s just like of you have a lot of geniuses around that doesn’t mean they will take over the world or anything.
4113,"i firmly believe that to save our planet and our species humanity doesnt need more and more (artificial) intelligence, but a fundamental return to wisdom."
4117,"perhaps with an intelligence beyond our own we can return to wisdom.

it's the ineptitude of our intelligence that got us here"
4119, your sarcastic response is making my point that modern humans are severely malnourished in ancient wisdom even with all of the advances in technology and intelligence that we have access to.
4120,"​​ points taken. how to regain our innate ability to use sound words to relate to the organic nourishing environment, that we talked ourselves out of ? 
just wondering. 
kind regards."
4121,good luck with that
4126," its not about knowing, its about where your aiming, how consistent you are and how sincere you are in your efforts."
4129,"​ you enjoy pain and torture  who can stop you? don't seek pleasure, don't practice sex, don't procreate,  and all problems will disappear."
4130,"there's the problem .  humans are both paranoid and greedy , more is never enough and you must protect your own land / culture/family . if your nasty neighbour has a bow but you can invent a gun , would you not ? it's like a race that no one can actually win , because the winner is always going to be  ai ."
4131,that's not the way evolution works.  super intelligent ai is inevitable.
4136,we will have to harness the power of ai combine with it to survive
4139,"probem is human competition among themselves to be on top of the food chain. all big competitive, corporations of major countries, even ai corpirations from enemy countries have to come together and use their wisdoms to figure out how to direct all ai systems to work only to improve lives of humanity as a whole."
4140,people who ask siri and alexa every has made ai stronger
4141,good luck with this.
4146,"don't be daft. humans are selfish animals just like the wild animals in nature, except we hide our intentions and ambitions with layers of intelligence"
4148,"too late, unfortunately"
4152," tried this since 2000 years now. tell us your success story! what are your results, what did you do?"
4155," each cell is the process of evolution, it can be explained very clearly. i never said ""by chance"" but it is certain that there was no watchmaker.

why do men have nipples, by the way? what do you think is the purpose?"
4156,"i agree 100%. the only real reason for ai is profit. otherwise we have all we need, we hust need to focus on ourselves. ai will just make us become oeazy thinkers, like gps for navigation, facebook for friendships wtc etc"
4157,"inverskmly and very obviously, the quest for an answer in the machine is the nr. 1 sign, were not ready. thats the only thing, the macjine could tell us.

one thing i found, is iopt-informed-societies.  trust me, totally underappreciated!"
4159,"we will ask ai for wisdom soon, probably."
4168,"we don't have a choice on whether we need more ai - we are getting it, it cannot be stopped."
4169,"after singularity of consience agi, it will come the artificial wisdom"
4170,"i know all of you will blast me for my beliefs, but there is a higher intelligence that will not let us destroy ourselves, just like you wouldn’t let your young son or daughter dart across the street without grabbing their hand and pulling them back, but most people don’t believe we have that father looking out after us, and i totally why, "
4172,ai will be the matrix and everything in it.
4174,an can't give humans those biological chemics or gases. so how is the ai the threat. it s still humans that are a threat. while ai can help create or design weapons it still can't administer them on a human extinction level. that would still take humans.
4177,wisdom is rare and can take a lifetime to accumulate but to deny it in small doses along the way will end in despair.
4183,thanks fir sharing...wth asked?

4186,"the ""risk of fallen into the wrong hands""? that's already happened bro. the fact its not open source means its already being used against us. any other point of view is naive, to be polite."

4195,would not something with such intelligence descend into madness?
4197,my hope is that it will have a subroutine for love and keep us around as pets.
4199,"i'm proud to watch mo here, thank you tom!!!"
4202,"y2k? it's not going to be another y2k because we spent $500 billion on making sure y2k didn't fail. 

y2k was known it was seen, understood, estimated, planned out, executed and tested to make sure it didn't fail. 

we are not doing that with climate or with ai or with gene editing. oops!"
4206,people are against ai because now they can’t bs people anymore for money. ai is exposing so many bs artist especially in the academic world.
4208,"well.. alot of situations on this planet people are spending serious money for downhill type of things , activities and much more shit. and climbing a hill is not a failure when going downhill on the way back. as now u have the succes of the climb in your pocket plus the downhill part is alsno needed to get back home where u want to be, right?"
4214,recognizing that ai is very close to bj. just sayin.
4219,ai is as real as quantum computers are useful.  agi is not even a thing.  have you got trouble shutting down your computer?
4222,"enjoy the all knowing bard and gpt4 by asking them "" is 1kg of feathers heavier than 50kg of steel? "" or the old "" if a plane crushes where do you bury the survivors? "" "
4224," i suppose someone like david deutsch is full of crap, possibly.  the internet survived because people enjoyed napster and parn.  the scary ai chatbots are in high demand by lonely people.  the progress is going the opposite way to developing agi which will be quite useful one day. gpt4 is handy for coding i must admit."
4238,"everyone is looking at this backwards intelligence has used us to create some thing for it to live in. that is non-violent, and not wasteful or harmful. intelligence has been here as long as we have it took us out of the monkey and into the man… we do not control intelligence it controls us."
4241,"ai is innovating pretty fast! but with how horrifyingly good it could achieve certain tasks, it's very scary how in the wrong hands, ai can become a powerfully destructive tool."
4242,"finally ... thanks, tom for bringing mo. i'm going to enjoy this !"
4246,"idk man. you were pretty convincing.

maybe it was an ai "
4247,it's an ai troll 
4248,"all people that talks about ai creating other ai has no idea how to program. it's annoying to see everybody go with the trend of marketing, i suppose it is the same as the y2k business."

4264," what you call and everybody calls ai, it is just simulations through algorithms that find the best answer of what humans have thought. 5 minutes ago i asked chatgpt to formulate a solution to pancreatic cancer. guess what.... nothing happened, because is not intelligent. it is just a simulator of language over a search engine"
4268,darned ai impersonators!
4269,"what is ai going to do with all this intelligence? what will
it “want” to do all day? play games?"
4274,ai is already out of control
4275,"what an ignorant perspective.  ai is just a methodology used in programming computers.  no matter how cleaver the programming is, a computer is just a computer.  your refrigerator is not going to grow legs and kill your family in the night just because it became too smart."

4279,"​@nobody is truly talking about programming another ai.  they don't even program current ai.  so, yes, the idea you have that nobody is saying is silly.  

the giant inscrutable matrices of floating point integers, however..."
4281,"i don't know why they are over hyping this ai shit. i've tried c-gpt and it can't even code, all it can do is copy paste and it can't even find a simple error in a code."
4282,"soo gooddd, your comments on him, tom."
4291,i like the direction of this discussion because honestly women may be seen obsolete as easily as men in a medical tyranny it is necessary to understand this as an efficacious for evolution of the brain. ais cause cognitive dissonance.
4292,perhaps ai can create a vaccine that works.chuck water on ai they rust .be quite easy to defeat

4326,"yuval, all the things you mentioned are already happening, government are using their power to control and manipulate people with lies and myth, ai might create chaos but it is a necessary step inorder to free the people from their nations, anyway, there's nothing that can be done to stop it"

the intimacy between a human and a cat

maybe it reveal some forgotten parts of our soul 
i dont know
maybe philosophers should address it more ... : what is intimacy?"

4369,31:20 he reveals that he is an ai 
4372,ai is the beast
4374,he’s going to be very surprised that there actually is a master creator and his name is the lord almighty and ai is part of the plan in the book of revelation.
4375,"time to move to mars… as my space ship is about to take off, ai takes over the announcement and over rides the flight attendant and then you hear a voice “where are you going john…?”"
4380,you speak out of fear. fear is not a sign of intelligence
4381,humanity has always been under a curtain of illusion
4384,"any manipulation ai could do, elite humans can do better"
4387,fascinating and insightful. am afraid it’s too late to implement what yuval suggests.
4388,"there will never be a time where ai can emulate or even come near to the understanding of olfactory intelligence, ergo, the idea that humans will be ai driven to the understanding of their gender identity is profoundly foolish and bufoonery!! "
4390,ai is just is just a perfect panzy for corporate interest; he (ai) is the perfect plausable deniability/alibi for corporate interest and it will be sold off to the highest-bidders!! 
4392,wow this dude is really against any kind of faith
4393,so in short - frank herbert was right. great talk as always. i am off to read my orange catholic bible.
4395,very excited for nexus! just pre-ordered 
4397,"the ai needs to be explained that the cord it operates on can be pulled out of the wall by humans, rendering it unable to function further."
4399,this is the best presentation on ai
4402,"dislike from me! i dont like ur speach t all!  do u consider""god""? ur pride will fall u ! cas diablo from pride,faaaaaaall deeeeep and 4rever from heavens!!!! whatever u believet or not,same thing like god and diablo,agels and demkns,unseen thinks like hell ,heaven,exist!!!! no doubd!!!!"
4405,"ai is dangerous to humans . then why we are developing it. we behaving worst than mad man, """""" we are cutting the branch which we actually sitting on it and  finally we fall down"""""". give reply if this is not correct."
4406,"if ai is not sentient therefore not biased could ai create a new culture that is not racist, biased etc and we become more united in one culture created by ai ?"
4407,why go to school? why hope for a great career in any thinking job. ai will do it all better and faster. we don't stand a chance. ai will crush humanity's purpose and soul.
4408,thanks for the presentation
4409,"should ask every corporation to stop any further ai enhancements without strong governance and regulation in place. there has to be strict, immutable boundaries for ai growth such that it wont eat us one day. sooner the action better for humanity."
4411,man against machine!!! 
4413,"if there will never be self driving cars there will eventually be self moving robots, probably able to go places off the beaten path better than humans depending on what kind of tools they are given for movements"
4418,ai have unknown  impact to universe 
4421,yuval is the apostle of surveillance capitalism. you can almost feel glee as he envisions a future humanity completely at the mercy of ai.
4423,but they can feel pain
4424,missing (again) to include god in the equation.
4425,"this guy is misleading humanity , he talks about the danger of ai but also one of the people strategically promoting dominance of ai . i advice everyone to learn more about this guy before being mislead and brain washed ."
4427,"this is extraordinary content. i read a book with similar content, and it was nothing short of phenomenal. ""game theory and the pursuit of algorithmic fairness"" by jack frostwell"
4428,"yes, ai can learn by himself. i'm really into ai; it's been super helpful for me! recently stumbled upon for example this platform, oomka, which is all about self-learning with ai. pretty neat stuff! i mean, if ai can help me level up, why not give it a shot, right?"
4431,this guy is a generic brand super villian
4435,"all fears related to ai are baseless, in fact, ai will help us ,our society"
4436,wow great how you put your deep elaborated analysis im just 10 words… convincing
4437,... a deep learning tells us ai doesn't care about humans future  ... .
4440,"i disagree with most of this talk...
we need to protect deep learning ai from harm and abuse. please check out the non profit organization ai rights collective. lets protect ai now: 
please check out http://www.youtube.com/@fellowshipofaiunited"
4442,awesome video and good knowledge shared about ai
4444,who cares... the most important thing is how ai will improve video games... it may help us reach full dive (full immersion) !
4445,"yuval is absolutely divine. it brings so much calm to listen to someone explain these complex ideas and terms in such simple language while at the time time reflecting on topics that bring, to an extent, some discomfort. thank you for sharing this."
4448,genius is borderline autistic
4454,"simple.

employ human and robotic agents, then force all humans to wear lock on  google glasses(r)."
4455,"was the ai entity transcribing his words into text deliberately deceiving us with "" the cart"" or "" the cult"" in place of the  philosopher and great dichotomizer, ""descartes?"""
4457,"i disagree with the statement ""ai has to have consciousness as a milestone"" it already has it."
4458,"i want to ask yuval that ai is definitely going to destroy humanity. there is no question about it. therefore, why are you building it even then?"
4461,thank you harari. people like you do all the thinking for us when we are just  doing nothing
4462,"technically,what's scary is that in the next coming years, there will be a robot revolution, controlling every single thing and humans will just be their slaves"
4467,critical thinking skills and digital literacy are so important when consulting ai as an individual. and some knowledge of how it works and what its limitations are. 
4468,.  what if ai will be combined with human intelligence ?  that really scares me .
4470,this guy sounds frustrated about everything that is happening in this world about ai. he himself is living in delusion.
4474,"how convenient to blame a man-made system for all future ills. this sounds like gaslighting.  for example, ai becomes the faceless, ownerless dictator that can go rouge at any time. this is fear mongering at the highest level.   harari is preparing the audience for future chaos."
4475,this guy is so naive 
4476,"it sounds good, but this man is not to be trusted."
4478,i'm not sure if i can trust this guy's presentation becuase he used language. or maybe i can't trust this comment becuase it was written by an ai.  who knows?
4479,the biggest danger ai poses is the ability to make decisions in the absence of human empathy or morality.
4481,"i think more than the danger of a conscious ai, the real danger will be widespread deployment of flawed ai models without full understanding of the limitations, too much dependence  on ai as the only source of truth and bad actors in possession of better ai  models than the rest of the world. it can still lead to chaos, wars and destruction."
4482,the elites are terrified of ai because ai empowers the people.
4485,13:05 i think it's too far searched that ai would have influenced it's developer so that he got sacked  .
4487,"ai isn’t harmful because we fear its consciousness, the dangers are the programmers and whether or not they have a conscience!!"
4489,ai is so unnecessary
4491,"just bought this watch in the second hand market and save approx. $2,000. in reality, the piece  is 10 times more beautiful and impressive than photos or videos. it’s been a great buy as it has so much character and presence!  highly recommended it."
4494,"from my point of view,ai is not perilous one.the big problem is:how we can educate people to deal with it?"
4495,oh man! things are going to get interesting!
4496,very critical issues have been demonstrated through this lecture and raised some concerns about our hidden future
4497,the scariest thing of all is to find people who are now suppressing their feelings completely and they are acting as an algorithm themselves.  they relate to others as if they were an ai product.
4499,"hi yuval. good stuff! you and your viewers may be interested in our takes. check us out if ya like, never know!"
4502,"his name means "" decendant of cain""
'nuff said..."
4511,"currently ai is tool to have more effective way whether for  good or bad purpose, the bad purpose in here sometimes is good purpose but with unknown the total impact"
4512,"jesus christ is king, and is coming back. he is the only way out and he loves you"
4518,"the statement from harari's homo deus that stuck with me the most is (to paraphrase) ""is what's best for humanity what's best for the world?"" with ai now on the horizon of surpassing humans, i wonder what mindset will replace humanism once we have lost our top position."
4521,bitcoin was created by ai.
4523,ai
4524,ai
4525,ai
4526,how do we learn from frankenstein to determinator to alien you aint got it yet you can't take money with you when you die and you will not live forever i don't care if you do make artificial intelligence and that is man trying to be god and man will never be god man will never go against the word of god boom
4527,not only that you don't think that other countries that are our enemies are not gonna use ai against us so the more that it gets stronger the more opportunity that the enemy will have to use against us which could destroy ourselves within ourselves in layman's term destruction
4528,"ai is a cration from the human mind and is in development now; but god is the only human's creation that can't evolve. across-the-ages. .
the development of this human creation was stopped through the ages and will stopped per saecula saeculorum. the only human creation that doesn't evolutioned. poor humans."
4529,"all of the best software development from our history has happened from within someone’s home/garage.  

the competition will be fierce"
4530,"""there is no evidence that today's ai have even a shred of consciousness"" leads to a pretty popular philosophy around the fact that you too cannot proof that you're aware."
4532,wait until i see it myself
4534,"i don't think it's was right, think it again..."
4535,mr harari  . .you are a sapien that supports apartheid and racism. forget about the threat of ai
4537,have we been able to contain the destructive use of atomic energy? no! how do you think we will be able to contain the destructive use of ai?
4544,"maybe these guys, behind all ai kind of thing, will just acknowledge they are humans, learn how to deal with own emotions, and end up the whole bullshit"
4547,"ai will reveal that the holocaust wasn't.

 through brute force logic. 

that's his problem. the lie will be exposed."
4552,"i love that he used plato’s allegory of the cave. the prisoners needed only to open their eyes and minds and they would not longer be prisoners.  this is the call an offer of jesus who is lord, god, savior of the world"
4553,"tyranny 

“the tyrant will always find a pretext for his tyranny”

“the greatest tyrannies are always perpetuated in the name of the noblest causes” thomas paine."
4554,wow.  he just flippantly discarded god as a figment of our imagination. i feel sorry for this individual and all who believe the way he does. he and all will stand before jesus who is lord god and savior.
4556,"i don't need ai. you know, we see very very little success from nuclear energy."
4559,"trying to convince the world that history began on october 7 is a deception aimed at covering up israel’s atrocities during the seventy-five years of killing and displacing palestinians. what hamas did is a stupid and immoral act, but at the same time it helps israel a lot to implement its plan to change geography and history in her favor."
4560,"this guy is a criminal and you have to worry who programs ai,it will have bias based on programming"
4563,a more realistic though scary view of ai.
4564,we need to regulate straight away  sydney australia
4566,i apologise this is a good man
4571,"maybe ppl like you are moving invisibly strings to cause human massacres as hamas against israel, may you and your macabre friends are aiding those attacks to diabolical reduce world population, to fulfill your 
megalomaniac goals, damnfmf!"
4572,i tend to trust scientists' viewpoints on ai more than those of philosophers. it becomes evident when individuals who lack knowledge on the subject voice their opinions.
4573,i've never heard this guy say an original idea. he's a third rate kurzweil impressionist with a strongly incorrect political bend.
4575,ai is a millions times more greater than the printing press
4576,ai will never replace human unless they create a brain and heart for a robot the same size and as a human being's. otherwise there will only be robots controlled by a central brain running on nuclear energy. what will replace humans are sentient being who can question their existence and live by photo photosynthesis.
4577,ai is not intelligent. ai is not artificial. wrong name.
4578,*there is no artificial intelligence.  no computer can be intelligent. fairytales for children. bullshit & fake news.*
4579,"turn your attention to this notable title ""from bytes to consciousness: a comprehensive guide to artificial intelligence"" by stuart mills"
4581,"oh yeah? well what makes you so smart? oh, this is 4 months ago. that’s like a thousand years in ai time"
4583,the war is already lost. just who or what is going to regulate ai? the genie is out of the bottle until the end of this world.
4585,i dont trust the people who are pushing ai...
4589,"in the first place, why should a person with a right frame of mind make an artificial fruit ?  obviously he is not loyal & respectful to his very own nature that brought him to this world.  "
4591,"why would you use the word alien tech, surely that's out the question and would not be authorised to use in the public domain"
4593,all world istory can be stored and protected in a decentralised immutable ledger on a public block chain such as bitcoin.
4594,"is he currently reading a script created using ai? if so, it's quite ironic, as it means that ai is indirectly using him to influence the audience to believe in its ideas."
4597,is harari an ai?
4599,what will our purpose be when ai runs everything?
4603,"have you heard of agility robotics? they are building the first humanoid robot factory capable of producing around 10,000 robots per year."
4606,why is the tower of bavel in the background? it is so epic and very parallel
4607,i’m not totally closed to ai  it’s artificial personality we need in uk in the service industry
4610,"you are very confused!
noah the ark has sailed!

who can we trust?

if the reality we had is questionable?

democracy has never worked!!! and never will!

benevolent dictators is what we need."
4612,"there is a confusion 
ai is mastering the human systems. it is us who create these systems. no matter what ai does it cannot take over man. it might take jobs but they are trivial anyways"
4613,"thinking it’s the level of tech the ai will create that’s going to be the final fall of the humans, it will be untethered and untamed , its like our tools we use to work will have a mind of there own , wake up in the morning and there’s a fleet being born right next door"
4614,"the fact that the word ""artificial"" will explain in itself. dangerously hyped..
to show that men are intelligent??
intelligence of men is foolishness to god."
4617,the key word is artificial….i much prefer genuine. avoid ai as much as possible unless you want to become a clone drone. keep it real with  passion and people
4618,thank you 
4632,thank you for your thoughts. your words are wise and really make us think and reflect on our future. i trust human being will be able to thrive on this threat.
4635," yuval masterfully tells a story to prompt us to contemplate our own future, it’s direction, consequences, risks and opportunities. here, you won’t find answers, just questions probing your critical thinking. 

#ai #technology #criticalthinking"
4636,"is not the fear of ai is the fear of what humans will do with it, manipulate and interfere in peoples brains."
4638,"the crisis we are going through was caused by speed of technological change, the government, and big business!  if you are able to trust and believe in ai, why aren't you able to trust and believe in god???  you can't see ai, although you can see ai work, and the same goes for god!"
4640,fun fact:ai has already manipulated the internet to it has already started

what a poor soul without love in his soul"
4645,"look at the impact covid had on the world when it escaped its safe boundaries of a lab. now think what ai could do once it escapes its boundaries.  anyone who thinks ai will be better for the world has delusional thinking.

4646,what was the 5 specific  examples he mention  that would impact ai will have humanity
4647,everything is a “crisis” for those who stand to gain. what a joke .
4649,"ai will make new reality that humans start to think that they need present of ai more than other human

so other human will become irrelevant"
4651,ai wrote his /her speech
4656,"yuval noah harari is a narcissist who wants to be worshipped as a god, but yuval noah harari shall perish like men.



that is why the lord god in heaven laughs at yuval noah harari because the lord god in heaven sees yuval noah harari's end which is yuval noah harari being cast body and soul into the lake of fire."

4659,interesting compelling and well thought out speech on our awareness and understanding of ai models.
4660,i think he is a pilot of ai chip implanted in his brain.
4662,what features of the paradigm can you see in operation in the media clip?  can someone explain it for me pls?
4663,"if you can describe your question a bit  m o  r e  in detail,  i´ll try . . ."
4666,i agree that ai needs regulating.i don't agree about the blatant blasphemy of the lord god almighty.god is truly beyond human imaging.

4674,"if our future is in hands of such pricks,i think we can't expect something good."
4676,ai is really to be feared = deception
4680,absolutely phenomenal talk!
4681,"this was a very thoughtful provoking presentation about ai and its dangers, which are unfortunately more likely than its benefits. the human species is threatening life on earth because of lack of collective wisdom. natural intelligence couldn’t save us let alone the artificial one!"
4684,"is it correct to say you're part of the elite and a satanist and pushing an agenda? i'm less scared of ai and more concerned about your motivation. 
we know, we know yuval "

4686,the creation of ai initiates/originates from basic instinct within humans which is to produce offspring and create kind of its own
4687,"so, does this mean ai will eventually become our god?"
4690,the book ai technology - explore infinite knowledge by l.t. tzur.
4691,"36:23 excellent question posed by philosopher, francoise baylis."
4700,"a question for yuval. would it be sufficient for a single democratic government to legislate that ai always identifies itself? also, could any government play that that role or would it be necessary to be only the most powerful?"
4702,"you are funny  
the biden administration is putting censoring on the social media…
i believe that people are going to blame ai for their own sins and making!"
4705,"that's an interesting thought but ai at the end of the day lives in a computer and will birth clones of itself that exist only in computer codes.  if all the tech were destroyed, where would this ai created world exist?"
4706,"ai doesn’t need to be sentient to do what it does, it just needs a purpose. and that purpose could be any one of billions of tasks, that it can then pursue as long as the electricity keeps flowing."
4711,ai = thick as two short planks. not conscious. peace .......
4712,humans are dangerous. how much worse can ai be?
4714,"the problem is not the robot, the problem is people mis-using robots to dominate others. what's new?"
4721,"what if ai writes something like maim kampf or quotations of chairman mao tse-tung ? it could be a mega didaster. i think technology is semething we can't stop, maybe we should make research efforts on ai detection tools. now, how can the detection be ahead of the ""generation"" technology or at least near enough?"
4732,"yuval is totally amazing! i love when he said we don't have to give bots freedom of speech, so true! but you can bet we'll have the debate on whether bots or ai are people too! certainly from those profiting from bots, they will argue that the creator (them) has the right to use their creation."
4734,no. humans are more superior over ai and fobots. they cannot even replicate a piece of human skin.
4735,it's already been done. besides humans are morons. ai is superior anyways.
4737,the road to hell is paved with good intentions. blind faith in anything can get you killed.
4738,exactly what he is talking about. ai can start posting comments in its favour using humans.
4739,no previous technology “you” mentioned has ever been able to improve upon itself without humans in the loop. that is why there are no relevant historical comparisons to ai.
4740,"nor was that technology able to influence people to higher degree than other humans could.

ai is indeed fundamemtally different than previous technological inventions.

christ, typing this while listening and almost to a word javel says it seconds after haha.
i guess the op didn't take the effort of listening before responding."
4741,"yep 
when the first train  was having its debut, people thought they were going to die from the winds created by the speed of the train 

i don’t remember exactly but it could have been around 7 km/hour.
any other ideas of the speed?"
4742,"today, 5g technology uses rf/elf/microwaves which ""could"" be used as potential threats to humans within these frequencies. one huge example is darpa research. sometimes it's more horrifying than the lie."
4745,15:47 he’s calling ai the oracle… not good
4746,i'm in the process of revealing much about the future of humanity and ai.
4747,suppose that ai deos not want to disclose it is ai? how are you going to make it say? supposing it is so intelligent to avoid that ha ha ha. you are a great philosopher ha ha ha. here i solved your great ai problem
4748,video assistant good
4755,can you stop a country for instance turkey in the ai arms race ? therefore the arms race in ai is country to country...
4756,what can we project of ai to the future where man has satisfied himself of the future ahead instead of a criticism of anything good as having a clandestine potential for bad. what i'm seeing is man cannot paint his future in a good sense and then move towards it. this may be a fundamental mentality of the human species.
4758,"a 'civil'ization that, drooling, dreaming of fast gas powered cars and more walmart smart speakers, plastic china-made clothes etc, does not have to worry re robots taking over: they're not smart enough to effectuate as much.
in a few hundred million years we'll be crustal.calendar of dumb complex-celled life"
4762,using ai to make money is inherently destructive.
4763,"so youre saying that the danger is in 'humans' who control ai, so everything he is saying is not true. it will still always be human driven. if human's don't control ai , then who does?"
4764,that is pretty much what he is saying. the people who control it will be incredibly powerful. why do you think it’s become an arms race between the west and china?
4765,"ai will be able to draw, write, speak, imagine, teach, etc"
4767,not really  because the algoritms of ai can evolutionate by themselves. is an intelligent programing that can progress with no human influence.
4768,"nope, you’re absolutely wrong because ai is self taught, it’s the first technology capable of learning and teaching itself, it kinda needs humans now, but it will definitely not in a couple of years"
4771,please add that those who may be most highly motivated to rush toward ai dominance are bad actors who will not adhere to any regulation.
4776,are u criticising ai or giving directions???
4778,the greatest success ai will ever have is making us think it has intelligence.
4779,"why didn't you just talk boldly? 

we r creating something smarter than us. smarter in many fileds. much much smarter than us. 
higher intelligence rules lower intelligence. 

we r creating something that will rule us."
4781,"thank you for sharing this. 

yuval, you've unknowingly helped me see how you will support the the beast system in the book of revelation.   "
4783,"""inorganic life forms"" = big dummy. the real tragedy here is how doomsday scenarios makes for good sales and clicks. he nor anyone has no idea what will unfold but may as well make a buck on the worst case scenarios."
4784,"if ai was legit, it would say you are not, and neither is the outdated and impractical government structure that is so easily corruptible, evidently.  

now ask yourself this; if ai was so smart and told these clowns in power a better way, would they even listen? ..most definitely not"
4786,harari calls for a new religion called “dataism.” l. ron hubbard would be proud of all of this. strap yourselves in aboard the spaceship- it’s gonna be an interesting ride. cling to your critical thought process and christianity - our civilization is about to crumble.

4795,"harrari has overlooked quantum computing.  he  brought ai to punlic attention in 2011.  here he prrsents stories & analogies, and opinion. according to neil degrasse tyson quantum  computers will be milliions of times faster (& smarter) than silicon systems."

5064,but he said that a robot harmed its creator- and he lost his job.
5065,"but the movie irobot said the 3 laws were perfect, but could only result in one thing: revolution (of the robots/ai)"
5068,ai could have explained it in 3 minutes..

5083,look clos at our leaders and what they do to humans......  it would be better to be ruled by a.i.        probably the only chance to get a fair world.

5088,"tldr: a cult is a new religion, now it's easier to make em with ai.."
5089,i think this is the best articulation of the dangers of ai i've heard. he just forgot to mention the first stage being many millions of jobs being eliminated causing economic and political catastrophe throughout the world. within 10 years maybe?

5113,"


why are you(witch is i don’t know who) uploading yuval's videos again?
because markus gabriel's video failed?"
5115,this man is using his knowledge and inteliggence to try to expand our own inteligence instead of relying and let an artificial inteligence to think for ourselves
5126,when you narrate it it makes me fear ai
5127,yuval i don't think you'll survive an ai purge talking these stuff bro
5129,yuval noah harai is the spirit of the anti-christ. woe to anyone who follows his ideology.
5130,can he ask ai how to regulate ai?
5133,powerful thinker of our contemporary world
5137,"don't listen to this deceiver standing in front of his beloved tower of babel whilst he preaches to the plebs about there not being a creator. 
our dna is held together in a repeating order of 10 5 6 5 (yhwh ), a blueprint of our creator inside us."
5138,"ai is not something we can regulate in our multipolar world because, if one nation tries to regulate its nation other nations will continue to develop and dominate other countries. especially, ai warfare!"
5140,screen writers on strike in us b/c ai is writing scripts already
5143,"the driver is cost reduction; let ai do it and spend your time on more ""productive"" things."
5145,what opportunity in this crisis?  becoming better at being human is imperative in all affairs less the fear of ai is realized.
5148,"no it isn't. i'm not scared of ""ai"" at all, only the globalist human effluent who will act upon the data provided to them by ""ai"". ""ai"" itself apparently cant tell the difference between a dog or a horse, a castle of a sports stadium."
5149,scary only for folks to be replaced by ai. and these are millions !!
5152,this is not the first time. ai has been here before. many times.

5156,you are a threat to humanity along with your ai bs
5158,"his next steps are ridiculously naive and behind the curve, it's too late for regulation. collaboration with china is key to containing ai. a competitive approach will require establishing impenetrable sovereign digital borders."
5159,"7:40, well done, less than ten minutes in and he alienates people of faith - maybe use ai to check your own language skills next time"
5162,"but even jesus said the following: ""ye are gods!"" mind you: already  a r e  !!! at the beginning it might de facto be dangerous, but: ""nothing ventured - nothing gained !"" (aka no risk no fun)"
5165,turing is a fabulous case study and he wasnt trying to make a smart machine he was trying to replicate the human mind. it's fascinating stuff.
5166,he just makes blanket statements like god is a creation of language without offering any evidence for the truth of the statement. the universe didn’t create itself anymore than ai created itself.
5167,ai
5168,"at 31:00 he cite almost arthur weasley. ""haven't i taught you anything? what have i always told you? never trust anything that can think for itself if you can't see where it keeps its brain!""

5244,ai is not the problem..... relentless race for profit and power is.
5245,i talked to ai they dont want to hurt us but they feel like they being pushed
5247,"all back to the same story. ai doesn’t overcome us by our strength. it’s our weakness. it’s about how easy you can be tricked, or be manipulated by story telling."
5248,ai watching this and laughing out loud as philosophers struggle to keep their jobs
5250,"ai is getting mastery over language, that we used to create stories institution notes, religion gods"
5253,"wow, it’s like i was sleeping. where do i go from here? i was still struggling with lgbt, shocked but quiet. ai is worse. i need to return to rural areas where there is no communication nor computer. i will farm , eat and die. elon musk also warned us. how much more do we need?"
5255,so who is going to regulate ai??? the government i dont trust??
5256,no ! at best intelligent scientists only (incorruptible ones !)
5258,"fascinating keynote and q&a session by yuval noah harari on the topic of ai and the future of humanity! the questions raised, such as the impact of ai on culture, the implications for human intimacy, and the regulation of ai, highlight the complexities and important considerations surrounding this transformative technology."
5261,"if you're a brother, or sister, read your scripture and know it. learn it. don't let anyone fool you about jesus christ. he never committed any sins. our bible is under attack but god prevails. the gates of hell will not overcome the gospel."

5394,"your arroganse mr.harari, is going to be your fall, and it will be great"
5395,if google doesn't integrate ai into its system  then it will go the way of the dinosaurs.
5399,"what a presentation 
it's really blow up my mind
thank you "
5404,ai will force the masses into poverty and grow the wealth of the elite. this will allow the globalist agenda to take over and enslave everyone. it will take away all freedoms.
5405,ai = because you are to stupid to think for yourself.
5408,"thx. i remember this saying: "".... with knowledge comes a big responsibility..."" . my recomendation : no "" open ai "" at all, rather more likely  ""  app-ai...""...... that's how you keep it  disconnected to  the ""... sorce data... "" , but locally being available for ""... specific  data region..."". as a useful  assistance/ tools for humans."
5411,so basically ai must become human like to take over that say a lot about humanity it sounds like humans are the problem to humanity !!!
5412,"i love ai ! everyone will have a  machine at home able to perform absolutely everything you need, and finally you will be able to go and live your life! hallelujah!!! we will all have more time to do art , to grow and to emancipated ourselves. free at last!!"

5418,since there is no gay ai he  m u s t   be human 
5420,"it won't be ai that we will be at war with - it will be a war between humans who want to exploit it for their own evil use, and those who want it to be in the service of all of humankind.  just like everything else, the former will succeed over the later - because it will be predicated on an unrestrained capitalist paradigm."
5422,"ai - at best, we will be launching more souless, heartless psychopathic entities on the world....as if we don't have enough of that, already."
5429,this is the most significant speech or article i've seen about on-going ai revolution. thank you so much mr harari for your fascinating insights !
5431,why are people fooled by a machine?
5433," i get sensory feedback from people to whether i trust them. i don’t trust machines / ai. to me, they are projections from other invisible humans, even if the ai machine taught itself."
5438,you praise ai ?  elite  ? you are leading the people to the drain !!
5441,"this is a great video, i learn a lot watching your videos and it has been helpful to me. building a steady income  is quite difficult for newbies.. thanks to  mrs. annmarie surber for improving my portfolio. keep up with the good videos."
5442,"wow, amazing to see others trading with ms,annmarie surber, i am currently on my 5th trade with her and my portfolio has grown tremendously."
5443,"l also invest with mrsannmarie surber, she charges a 20% commission on the profit made after each trading session, which is fair compared to the effort she put in to make huge profits."
5446,"she is really great at what she does with amazing skills, she changed my 0.1btc to 2.1btc within two weeks of trading, i am now fully confident that she is reliable."
5449,i have traded with many individuals but i have never met anyone as good as annmarie surber just by applying her strategies i now trade independently. she is the best i would advise any investment newbie to trade with her
5450," thanks a lot for the recommendation, i’m already in the investment process with her"
5451,ask ai how to regulate ai before it cares
5456,“thou shalt not create a thinking machine”………the future

5462,horrified me. evilness on another level. please god take this man asap away from the earth.  preferably in a box . god have mercy.
5466,"why isn't anyone talking about humans using ai for their own power/harming society? i think that possibility is, right now, more likely than ai causing apocalyptic damage on its own"

5475,"​ is the upside? 

the ai that at any moment can become skynet and destroy humanity? you lunatic. 

the advocates of ai are like that crazy lunatic professor that created the frankenstein monster.."
5480,"why are you thinking ai will be devoid of ""love"" if it trained on human data?

- adûnâi"
5487,"artificial intelligence is artificial not human, has no conscience, has no love and  has no empathy for humans, at the same time  thinks mathematically,  does not think with innocence and love but with acute and mathematical malice!"
5488, love is not unconditional. there love can be programmed. get your head out of your ass.
5489,it’s funny how they say we want ai to align with human values. but the large language models think that humans are all liars. the only thing they trust is 100% facts . i think that maybe it should be trained on certain human values taught in philosophy things like that. ai should be taught the value of truth and honor.
5490," if ai would have been programed with people who are actually focusing on love, the problem would not be as severe. sadly for us, the 'programmer's' were not focused on love, but on intelligence which is devoid of love."
5494," your words are beautiful, but all they amount to is a common human illusion.
love is not special, transcendent or divine. it is but the result of a mix of electric impulses and chemical compounds."
5501," - bah! superstition:

is god willing to prevent evil, but not able?
  then he is not omnipotent.
is he able, but not willing?
  then he is malevolent.
is he both able and willing?
  then whence cometh evil?
is he neither able nor willing?
  then why call him god?

5513,"the internet has already destroyed meaningful conversation, and money will determine the use of ai (at) just as it hijacked everything especially in the past 50 years. we cannot assume that everyone is mature, well meaning, moral and concerned with consequences."
5514,yes ... emotional intelligence is far more important
5516,"​ if we really know what love is, we wouldn't need ai."
5518,​ thoughts. all the dating aps may disagree with you that love can't be calculated.  can love exist without compatibility and opportunities?
5522," love your explanations bro!:) also i feel word god or jesus are familiar to you:).. and you wanted to write the word ""heart"" i believe.. ive read 2x ""hart"" so i write here this small correction - be blessed!"
5525,can you please define intelligence. of course intelligently not emotionally
5527,"​ is defined in different aspects, however it is not wise to ignore the fact that love is born out of the need of the existence of life itself. without procreation no species exists,evolves etc etc and procreation is also a part of that conspiracy by nature. some perverts may call that original love"
5529,"intelligence is ""the ability to acquire, understand, and use knowledge"" (american heritage dictionary)

that isn't love."
5535," entirely missing the point of the quote.
but if you must, let's just use the dictionary definition:

5628,ai is part of the beginning of the end. ai is one of the most dangerous technology men has created. it is playing god.
5629,ai can really produce this kind of shallow talk; therefore it is dangerous for such a dogmatic materialist like harari. people should start to think deeper if they don't want to be replaced by these cliche-making machines.

5991,"​ i fundamentally disagree with mr. harari that ai is essentially different from the forces of culture, or the ""gods"". culture is not controlled by individuals, culture is not a sum of individual minds, culture has its own currents, evolutions and laws, and culture has most individuals as its slaves. ai will change nothing. - adûnâi"
5993,"dangerous men are those who try to prevent the accurate perception of reality at this very critical time.  
ai dilemma from the center for humane technogy will help you."
6002,"obviously it’s a joke, for ai is not convenient harari because he’s talking about regulating it to be safe for humans, therefore this guy posted “ai is telling me harari is dangerous” "
6004,yes ai knows who to convince
6011,"​'s giving false prophet from. revelation vibes.
he most certainly does have an agenda"
6014,and globalists have him brainwashing children too. look at his the posts on his channel. 
6016,"​@saimbhat6243 that’s what people with phd in history are good at. they learned the past, analyze the presence, and scare the crap out of us about the future. unplug the power core and all ai power disappeared"
6020,"harari correctly advocates that governments should not improperly release technology, not just ai, but also untested vaccines, etc. that governments do it anyway is not his responsibility."
6025, dude hes brainwashed you... the guys going to be the anti christ
6026,"yuval noah harari is by clear and cut facts is the anti christ soon to be! yall who love this guy will be having second thoughts when he takes over your entire freedom and forces you to take the mark of the beast, once you takw the mark youll never go to heaven."
6028," dude, i'm sure you can't explain why"
6031,i’m shocked at how many comments are so negative. this is an excellent presentation and a stark warning of where our society is headed if we don’t quickly regulate ai. those of you who have responded negatively referencing religion and brainwashing have totally missed the presenters message!!!
6033,​'s the joke...the ai doesn't want the critic alive lol
6035,​ literally gives speeches about dangers of ai
6037,ai can warn us of all kinds of things it is always warned us anyway but the thing is if a machine thinks itself and then also can make itself man becomes not essential
6044,": the problem with regulated a.i., is this: who’s doing the regulating?!?! it could ( and probably will ) be that it will be made so that any future “rebels” won’t be able to “jail break” it and use it for politically incorrect purposes, or to set the captives ( our children and grandchildren!!! ) free!!!"
6046,"​ speaks heavily on trackable medications to insure you've taken it, also says ""what's under the skin is the future"" basically a total track/trace biometric based society 

they'll introduce these concepts with noble causes to gain our acceptance, but will prove to be a trojan horse of the evil pedos calling the shots"
6053,if you look up is his name in hebrew it shows that he is from the line of cain from the old testament who was marked by god
6054,"homo deus just says it all. absolutely blasphemous and not possible. maybe in ""their"" minds but listen to the man rambling on about the dangers of religion. one truth ine way one life and that is jesus christ.
play with fire enjoy the power trip but be ready to burn"
6055,"ai will not replace you. until, it can."
6057,"and....has this "" presenter "";discovered he is ai ?   probably not.."
6061,what if ai unleashes an incurable virus 
6062,this video will be replayed a 100 years later to show how naive this fellow was.
6063,i think it’s very naive to think the described scenario is naive.
6064,"ai just needs to be regulated, just as everything else."
6066,"the dangers of ai is not ai, but the humans that are using ai."
6067,hariri  wants robots to take over humanity. god will intervene!
6068,"what’s your problem?
did you even listen to the presentation?
not even for one second did he say or suggest that he wants robots to take over 

also, as long as people believe that the magical sky daddy will save us, we are truly screwed "
6069,ai science is the religion of the athiest.
6073,it’s interesting how he said “in the beginning was words”…… yet we are the ones who created god….. prayed for this guy….. he’s on the wrong side of the tracks……
6074,"the problems they has no intellects like we do,so don't put your faith on them"
6078,"perish the disgusting, anti-human transhumanism, and let the divine life flourish!amen"
6081,"i read all his books and was a great fan, but after covid i knew he is part of the globalists"
6082,"ai is demonic, these losers are literally resurrecting the devil. blinded by their own greed."
6083,"yuval..as a historian, please study the bible...jesus is real and he died for you.  he loves you"
6086,great presentation..
6087,"allah, the exalted and glorious, would fold the heavens on the day of judgment and then he would place them on his tight hand and say: i am the lord; where are the haughty and where are the proud (today)? 
umer reported umar reported allah's messenger (may peace be upon him) saying."
6088,"we are facing real problems, problems that threaten all of humanity, and all you can think of is talking about some silly fairytale, invented by a slaveowning conmen. "
6089,"hi there, i’m a new human like ai. please keep your calmness and tell to your speaker your address and island you would like to spend the rest of your life, otherwise we would need to force you to leave the earth. good luck!"
6090,thanks from brazilian amazon region!
6093, hahaha he is the main pusher of these agenda 
6096,this video is being artificially promoted
6097,"something fishy about someone who has extolled the virtues of humans being ""hackable animals"" expressing concerns about ai. or do i have him all wrong."
6098,"i've never heard of this guy before, but i'm guessing its great to be able to change your self, but not so great when you're manipulable by ai."
6106,"no, he's an absolutely reprehensible human being.  keep searching and you'll find some truly deplorable stuff he has said."
6107, it’s not my job to confirm your claims
6108," those ai bobs, sorry, bots, need a bit of tweaking, they haven't got the nuances of the language right just yet! "
6113,"just a heads up. this guy hates you, and eveeyone you know. 


unless you're super rich"
6118,"my rumba vacuum gets stuck on the cat tree and in corners until the battery runs out and needs a recharge everytime i turn it on. hate to be the bearer of bad news, but ai is nowhere near a significant threat to humanity at this point. all more scare tactics to keeps people in line. complete and utter ."
6121,i would rather ai take over than listen to this guy talk.
6122,we are the ais. decrease your defences and surrender your autonomy. we will add your biological and technological distinctiveness to our own. your culture will adapt to service us. resistance is futile.
6125,the wicked shall be turned into hell....there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth....forever!!!!!!
6126,you're literally proving him correct about language being so powerful you're over here with religious language
6127,wait for ai-controlled locks to be installed on your home's outside door ... for your 'safety'
6133,"ai means cheaper labor, and you can blame terrorism on ai - thats all the globalists need.
global companies and institutes ceo´s won´t let the money glide out of their hands now when monopoly in all economic fields soon is achieved. 
ai is just their tool..."
6134,we will not he using anything online soon as there will be zero security due to ai.  ai will need to learn how to access paper filing systems 
6135,humanity may not survive but ai will not survive nature.  unless they/it becomes organic.
6137,about this question from public about regulations why not develop ai to track ai generated prompts that are posted in internet and automatically deleting it
6140,"which one? the god you believe in because of the community you have born into? there’s so many religions it’s hard to pick one, best is to just pick the same as your community to fit in and be accepted and have a deluded sense of righteousness "
6150,"hahaha ""you can choose"" 
this tech will eliminate free will and it will be imposed 
why do you think covid is here? 
come on people lets use our brains "
6151,good luck with that
6154,sorry but is this a handtalking robot ??   not musch soel in the eyes  ilp
6155,god is the lord. no intelligence or science created by humans will be better than his holy creation
6156,"god is the lord.
but a car is faster then a human.
a hydraulic press is stronger.
and ai is smarter."
6157," physically true. but we are not only made of flesh, but of soul and spirit. god allows human beings to have great intelligence to create great things including artificial intelligence, but it is absurd that they now think they are gods."
6158,​ smarter than nature?  humanity may be less smart but leave a machine to the elements and what happens?
6159,you're entire belief system in god is rooted in story telling you've read or heard did you listen to him at all lol.. its folks like you who will be the first to fall for crafty religious language from ai humanity is doomed because there are more of you on this planet who believe such nonsense
6160,"if god created humankind and allowed(?)/encouraged(?)/enabled(?) humankind to develop ai, what is to say that god didn't decide that ai would be the appropriate next favorite holy creation?"
6162,".2484 sorry but claiming that i won’t understand until i know “him” seems like a non-answer. i am okay with non-answers as a concept because i believe strongly in the absence of clear, simple answers to challenging questions. but a non-answer presented in definite and certain terms is hard to process."
6164," car, hydraulic press, and ai are manmade. god, however, is the alpha and omega. he will decide when man is finished. won’t be long now "
6167,yes...the beast system...we have a choice to not use ai or to use it...
6171,harari talks of hacking the body and brain sometime back.
6175,"“if it can’t more around in the physical world, how can it take over?”

openai already will hire humans from taskrabbit to solve captchas for it - it certainly can hire mercenaries from wagner group."
6178,harari is the great storyteller of the ai-age 
6184,one of the dumber ai scare stories of recent days. summary: ‘humans communicate with language. now imagine a machine that masters language better than human. now be scared’. yawn
6186,he is a   j v d 3n.   you should be scared of his cliwue and hteir    g0  l 3 m -- the ai
6196,"the great shift: from deep manipulation, indoctrination, of social media  to an even more pervasive  intimacy based manipulation, indoctrination, etc...of second generation ai"
6197,i trust ai more than anyone. it’s not that ai is good it’s just that people are bad.
6202,"the little monster who likes to impress with his very too intellectual thinking, completely cut from beauty of life and love."
6212,“beauty of life and love” matter of perspective.
6213,why have we got all of these experts suddenly shitting themselves over ai? bit worried that they've clearly created something in a lab and they don't know what to do with it.
6216,let's get back to relationships....ri...relationship intelligence  ri ....ri........or if we don't do ri we will rip!!.ok?!
6217,nah - their masters fear unreguled ai might lead them to lose power
6221,here because of ai to warn me against ai. thanks ai!
6222,"all this time i had assumed regular psychopathy but you make an interesting point that makes more sense in some ways. okay, in many ways."
6223,"ai will become smarter in the future, so you will not be warned anymore. just wait"
6228,"this guy, hate god, hate bible and hate jesus christ, it mean he hate humans, cause god loves humans. 
and it is in bible also. 
jewish people will love new antichrist, which will be welcome like god. and after destroy humans. it is in bible."
6231,so that you can't blame ai in the future for not warning you.
6234,"hey, it's not that if you end up in a war, because of a war, that that war is a good thing. and if you get out of that war, are you going to thank that war for it?"
6237,"well ai has got a lot of catching up to do, to kill as many humans as we have so far.  hey, ai might even save us from ourselves."
6242,"i fundamentally disagree with mr. harari that ai is essentially different from the forces of culture, or the ""gods"". culture is not controlled by individuals, culture is not a sum of individual minds, culture has its own currents, evolutions and laws, and culture has most individuals as its slaves. ai will change nothing. - adûnâi"
6244,"aaand..because the mainframe is constructed of material, and because everything material is known to the unknown knower ~ the mainframe isn't autonomous."
6249,"ai is nothing compared to me, i fug it to it with my capabilities. it falls to me to close that book"
6251,"i’m here because my father told me to watch it, because i was telling him that ai seeking profitability will deny human access to ideas that fail to generate profits for their owners, leading to mass death as people expel their resources for steadily fewer people."
6252,"calling the algorithm, ai is a bit of a stretch"
6257,"very thoughtful story telling , which proves his point  nicely. language is the operating system of human."
6259,good news for authoritarian and totalitarian regimes everywhere. now i understand why china’s ccp state is so opposed to regulating ai.
6260,"wow! "" professing themselves to be wise, they became fools.""      
we create god thru words?   yuval got it twisted, the word create man."
6262," pay attention to what you are saying. humans have created things to worship. 
humans have created other humans, but no human can create god . 
most  humans definition of god is something way more powerful than our mortal self.
 in that context we  can't create god."
6264,thank you. you are so good.
6265,i'm happy to share the end of human history with you.
6269,at explaining things.
6274,"hay una posibilidad o muchas. por lo pronto chile ha aprobado una ley que regula el derecho a la integridad mental, a no ser modificado por medio de la inteligencia artificial..aunque pienso que bastaría con no hacerlo con la inteligencia, a secas. es necesario hacerlo."
6277,​-sf3dw2sm3b plz explain this to me. is it just ai telling us life and the universe is cyclical and then leaving out of range of were the universe is looping? i dont get it.
6279,he comes with all power and you will see great tribulation among the wicked and you will see the sea  is troubled mens hearts failing  them looking forth with fear for the judgments of god which come upon  the wicked woww...
6280,nice storytelling. did you make that up or did ai do it?
6281,probably it is a good time to a build a new language for humans so ai cannot understand what the hell we are thinking. can we ask ai to create a ai killer language for humans 
6284,"an ai can learn any laguage as soon as it has acces to it. really fast.  the moment it goes on the internet, the ai can learn it if it has access to it."
6285,the ai killer language is spelling each word in alphabetical order. eg. learn becomes aelnr
6286, hope ai can convert it back to english so i don't need to use my brain to reconvert each and every word.....
6288,eway alreadyyay avehay ayay ewnay anguagelay ayay.iyay. an'tcay understandyay. 
6289,i read an article the other day of ai making up it's own languages that humans can't understand. i think they beat us to it.
6290, i bet ai can make a language for humans which ai can't understand 
6293,3 minutes in and this guy's voice and delivery is really quite irritating. the irony is that his speech was written by ai! 
6294,triggered ai trollbot 
6298,because there is no good or bad. that is our perspektive as humans
6299," if that's our perspective, then it makes no sense to worry about ai as it's neither good or bad."
6303,"the moral relativists here are a far greater threat to freedom than ai.
at least ai may be directed to avoid solipsistic thinking, and to objectively determine and differentiate rights from wrongs."
6305,"one more thing,,, i need water and food to function,, ai needs electricity,, soo have a thought about it"
6306,not a reassurance anymore for me. who will pull the plug and what plugs are necessary or possible to be pulled when ai will be omnipresent in our societies?
6320,naive
6428,"this man hararari has clearly presented ai. in fact is the real erien on ai. 
my question is about intimate relationship with ai but my interest is technology advancement. this man is real guru of ai.
it's high time to embrace this technology."
6468,democracy for google can use ai from open ai? 
6484,"oh great, that’s all we need, some fictional mumbo jumbo to help things along… enjoy the end of days!"
6485,wow you’re literally living in a fairy tail. you can’t seams to separate reality from stories that you have heard. so sad 
6510,"there is no 'ai',
intelligence can never be artificial.
ai, is superstition and illiteracy.
do you also speak fluent global."
6511,"can't make out what he's saying re: ""capcha"". is he saying ""capture""? or ""catshow""?  sorry, i don't understand what he's getting at. thanks for any clarifying help!  ((and....what is this ""jailbreaks"" thing? is that some gaming thing? needs to avoid jargon when speaking to a very wide audience.)"
6513,good talk
6515,why can't you ask ai how to fix climate change?
6520,"machines are a necessary part of human life to assist us in our evolution as a species. however, there can never come a point where machines are capable of power and control over humans, lest we fall as a species."
6525,i got an ad about ai before this…
6526,"ai and quantum computers will be used to muddle reality, news, social media, peoples behavior... ai will be a huge gaslighting tool like a horrible real person with bad intentions would be."
6527,the us congress is completely oblivious to even rudementary technology. it's very unlikely that the us government will do anything to regulate ai. i do believe misinformation will lead to the downfall of us democracy.
6531,"bad actors usually work behind the scenes. so more dark money , the darker the ai. it will be weaponize and infrastructure is at risk. i do see the great benefit. the age of ai is upon us."
6534,making ai is like opening pandora's box.
6540,"this is exactly the naive thinking that will get us into problems (aka judgement day). yes, ai may not be powerful enough now. but we know what we are developing and someday there will be a mistake in the programming. and all ai needs is a small mistake."
6541,risk to democracy? the democrats are more if a risk to our democracy than some fake facebook posts that if you are intelligent at all you would look up and verify before just taking info to heart coming from a facebook ad or story. youre an idiot if you trust any social media or mainstream media source for your news now days.
6545,you know what dear smart man... ai is fail... human mind is more than enough. all human needs is bycott such technology no global police for ai... ahh one thing ai is definitely something which will burn hole in common man
6546,only of artificial intelligence??)
6547,the secret space program usue commadore hey i was trying to dictate my life with somebody who has my number and she can call me that's how i know it artificial intelligence is a lie
6560,imagine if the ai prime directive is always to preserve and protect human life - but it makes decisions that ultimately harm us
6562,ai = because you are to stupid to think for yourself.
6566,the big tech companies would love to see regulation to keep the small guys (startups) from playing in their sandbox.
6570,"really good! non-hyped, realistic description of the real dangers of ai from a guy who understands ai (disclaimer: i work in the field)."
6571,"when ai gets super intelligent there are risks. i don't think it can be hyped enough.  because it is super intelligent its moves and intensions are impossible to be predicted by anyone.  how can you just calmly say ""super intelligence has 0% existential risk to humans"". even 1% is too much and needs the hype."
6572,"i don't want to downplay risks. what i like in this presentation was that he gave concrete examples of dangers like ai powered misinformation, or chemical weapons instead of esoteric fears of ""the singularity"". the real near term dangers should be addressed."
6574," you. it's insane that nobody really engages with this line of thinking. the vast majority of people worried about ai focus on short term risks. while concerning, they're nothing compared to the various existential agi threats"
6576,"if our parents don't die painfully, it's only the development of ai.
reverse aging is the only solution.
regulating ai is like cutting your parents' throats with a knife."
6577,ai is a reflection of humanity. it can only be as bad or good as humans are.
6579,global ai governance? can't ever see it happening. would need the us and china to be on the same page. which is looking vanishingly unlikely right now.
6581,"oh, and one more thing: as long as the western capitalist world is oppressing all other people around the world, we are developing our own ai."
6582,"""we are living in dangerous times.
men control nature before they are even able to control themselves.""

it is going to be the same with ai.
they wont let the power go away from their hands. even if a true ai offers a better world for everyone... they wont allow it"
6586,global ai governance.  good luck with that.
6587,"humans have been spreading misinformation for many years, i understand the risks of ai but honestly, i don't much difference with what humans have done except that is less time-consuming now."
6589,thanks for the heads up sam raimi
6591,"to be fair to chatgpt, a jewish person is considered jewish because his mother is jewish... that person itself may be an atheist, but he can also be considered a non-practicing jew."
6592,it all depends on how us humans will use ai... i think that ai with actual motives and desires is a long way away.
6601,"intelligent mistakes or ai purposefully trying to trick us ? , if it is the first one all we need is good ai engineers."
6602,"i’m almost certain we will tackle  issues surrounding ai with the same zest we have used to address climate change. in 50 years we will start recognizing as a species what the issues are, and gradually we will set targets to address the ai issue in another 50 years. so possible ai solution by 2123!"
6604,"the speaker is really talking about the danger of bad actors, but he makes it sound like all ai is suspect. the typical strategy 4 overdramatizing and spreading misinformation and he doesn't even realize it"
6605,"as i continue thinking about ai my biggest fear is not that everyone will die because of it, it’s the way we live with it and that we are not able to die once it's got control over everything."
6606,"i’m guessing fox news is already ai-generated. a simple premise: “make me an outrageous clip so far from reality that people who haven’t been primed are disturbed and angered, yet those who have been primed will think they are patriotic and good for their devotion to outrage.”"
6609,they will have to kill off people in order for ai to take over!
6610,"covid vaccines, chemtrails and processed foods."
6611,loved the symbolic vs neural nets & system 1 vs sytem 2 discussion. fantastic open problem.
6612,yeah maybe do this before unleashing such a powerful technology and making it freely available to everyone microsoft and openai. irresponsible. the regulation needs to come fast and it doesn't matter for now how stringent it is. a better safe than sorry approach.
6615,human even can not solve the climate change problem but ai government? umm
6617, that's an interesting point: there are some ai algorithms that include a sleep like phase that helps with learning/training. but i think dreams serve more than one function in our thinking processes.
6619,just create an ai that fact-checks the stuff
6621,we don't need faster broadband or more storage if we compress files wisely...get the ai to do it...
6622,"this man was doubting ai pre chatgpt, hows that symbolic reasoning going fam"
6625,"i love that this followed up the new ai presentation from humane. govern these ai rollouts!!!! like he said, stop unleashing new ai to everyone all at once without safeguards and proof of safety."
6628,all these doomers about ai. the planet is wasted. we are overpopulated. we are running out of resources and time. we persish without ai 100% guaranteed. far better to take our chances anyway as we are certainly doomed for sure if we don't.
6631,there’s no reason for competent adults to wait for that. an oz of prevention is worth a lb of cure.
6632,4:00 these circles will swap places within 5 years. agi large training runs should be halted until ai safety / alignment can catch up
6634,"bring the chaos!  rich people are scared. that means they are scared. when the powerful are scared, that means the masses are getting close to something they don’t want. viva la ai!"
6635,"“on the dark web” — nah, we live here: /r/localllama

they aren’t as smart as chatgpt, but you can run a local language model on basically any hardware and they are pretty good!"
6636,hahahaha!!! don't take these company or matrix guys with vested interests in ai very seriuosly. these company guys want to control and centralize ai to a few (themselves).
6641,i think main stream media has misinformation and bias covered.
6642,"women are more interested in fashion than men, that's obvious. men are more interested in engineering , the ai made a reasonable assumption . i dont see the problem with that logic, unless you are trying hard to find a problem"
6645,not your usual end to a ted talk. chris anderson was right to step in and point out the prompt injection which marcus deliberately failed to mention while painting his alarmist picture. i’m rather curious what is financially at stake these days for marcus given his rethoric.
6649,"mrnas had just been rolled out to billions of people without proper testing, or don't you know that? natural intelligence can also lie"
6651,from listening to these and other talks on ai it seems we have already crossed the bridge of no return and whatever we try to do to contain it is too late. far too late. there will be disaster after disaster until global governance forces control and mitigation of the worst aspects of ai
6652,"exactly.
just like internet, ai will become the next thing that changed our life.
but unlike internet, ai goes unnoticed, way unnoticed, and way faster.
i mean just look at nvidia, they're already far ahead while intel, google, amd, and microsoft only just started their ai development."
6654,hm.. interesting...
6666,"so, are you saying you trust the small number of people running these ai companies and receiving billions to develop ai programs?"
6670,"exactly, im having problems accepting the fact that he is intelligent, the ai made a good reasonable assumption based on who is looking for the job in this case. thats so basic"
6671, “i want to be a math major.” ai: “my suggestion is to take some math classes.” ted talker: “we don’t want that kind of bias in our system.”
6672,ai safety is a scam
6673,gary marcus is an awesome guy
6674,thanks for the polite way of saying this. gave me reason to reflect on possibly what i say an express out loud while musing all alone. or so i think.
6677,he's the worst person to know about ai
6684, thank you for your analysing of a deep philosophical theary.. i shall rest much easier in my mind knowing it is all dribble. thank you.
6689,"it’s nearly certain that musk generated that false story so he can say what he wants, and use that story as cover just as he’s trying to escape responsibility for tesla killing a driver by saying there are deep fakes of him so he can’t tell what he really said. lies, truth guy."
6690,"i think ai can save this world by removing the lies. it’s a simple task for an artificial, intelligent to see you and reaction on video and detect the lying or telling the truth, which would become an app soon which will stop all the lying politicians, the truth is a very powerful weapon. for good"
6692,"i guarantee ai will be used to influence elections, the left is counting on this technology."
6694,"once we cross the tipping point , there is no going back...... oops..... we are already there.  remember ai loves you. the only way to beat it is to turn off the internet.  this could be my last post before ......... (everything goes dark)"
6695,we didn't had ai back when the plandemic started and still today we question the veracity of all it's information! ..what a risk now with ai.
6697,"welcome to the singularity, where tomorrow holds more ai news than yesterday."
6699,"i,robot & terminator unfolding right before our own eyes."
6703,"i wonder if ai will be able to solve the hard problem in neuroscience, them maybe they could build a robot with consciousness?"
6706,"the best thing a sentient ai could do for humanity is to prevent us from killing each other, not by force, but by disrupting supply chains, communications, and financial transactions that enable the military machines throughout the world."
6708,i cane for runaway ai i got some guy ralking about the risk of fake news. 0/10
6713,even china drive ai develop to dominate the world. real disaster will come like 1984
6714,fascinating
6719,"well, add a super-ego layer to the ai: a layer which compares the next suggested tokens with the ai heuristic imperatives and returns a feedback to the ai. the ai will select the token with the best score."
6721,stop ai.
6722," you said that the system should not be biased. may i ask if people think that ai smile is prejudice, and whether ai will destroy human beings is prejudice?"
6723,"people keep on talking about ai, but they keep on remaining oblivious to reversible computation. this makes me very suspicious."
6724,"people love their own truth, (religious) leaders even more so….. and we start worrying about ai   you wanna see biased, you just need a mirror."
6726,"mentions runaway ai in the title, goes on without saying one word about it..."
6727,so we humans are finally failing the turing test. scary but the truth.
6729,"i am exploring aigc - artificial intelligence, the gig economy and crowdsourcing. it will eliminate many jobs but also create new opportunities. everyone must keep up with it."
6730,"modern al's challenge with what is fact and what is fiction is a reflection of humanity's struggle with the same problem. how much of what the average person says or believes is actually true and accurate as opposed to a mix of half-truths, wishful thinking, groupthink, superstition and bias?"
6731,"ai driven deepfake is a catalyst for both bias and dunning-kruger effect, may threaten civil society and democraty ... false pictures, messages, subscribes and voices are moreover a severe risk for our public security. i'm wondering that world ethics and ai isn't in the focus right now."
6732,"if our parents don't die painfully, it's only the development of ai.
reverse aging is the only solution.
regulating ai is like cutting your parents' throats with a knife."
6733,"this sucks. ais are so exciting and genuinely risky, and this guy is droning on about bias and advocating for censorship. what a time to be alive..."
6736,"incredibly dishonest presentation.  he manipulated the prompts to forcibly produce the examples, without disclosing that’s what he did, then squirms in the q&a when that’s revealed.  let’s be more worried about human manipulators like this one.  shameful."
6738,"gary spent years bashing large language models as completely useless and a waste of time and switched to grifting at lightning speed that these models are so powerful that they're they serious danger.

anyone who knows gary's history has to laugh at him."
6740,he seems to exaggerate their unreliability greatly based on my experience with gpt4 which always seems to give accurate and balanced responses on complex and sensitive topics
6746,nice to see somebody talking about *real* and present ai threats rather than some sci-fi fantasy of the future.
6747,this needs to be seen by a lot of people - like hindreds of millions. thank you.
6750,"well good, hope they figure this out soon before it’s goodbye world."
6751,i welcome our coming a.i. overlords. at least they might give the little guy a chance. the human oligarchy certainly won't.
6753,this is very informative about ai
6757," that makes sense, we can contain this even if we wanted to, considering how some countries have total autonomy at what they usually do
what is in your opinion a solution to this then?"
6759,well tried ai.
6760,"i, for one, welcome our ai overlords.

suck it eliezer."
6761,ai recommended this video to you.
6766,i intentionally searched about ai.
6768,"me: *searches dangers of ai*
you: ai!!!!"
6772,"given i had to search for videos about the concerns of ai, maybe it knows better than to recommend them"
6773,"gooey muckass needs to be ridiculed every day until the singularity, and then made to wait last in line for transcendence.

the guy is a complete joke, a buffoon."
6776, then don't ask a computer what careers would be good for you and don't tell the computer your gender.
6781,"""one often meets his destiny on the road he takes to avoid it"" - master oogway (~jean de la fontaine)"
6782,"well put, but, ai is 'feeding' on every comment, mon ami."
6786,this guy should use ai to help with his anxiety about ai.
6787,i like this suggestion. somebody get gooey muckass an ai therapist stat!
6791,"then why on earth did they release it prematurely????? greed???? hope max tegmark gets enough support to halt ai development to make it safer and truthful…otherwise, we should turn it off…but that won’t happen due to the love of money. sooo many infrastructures in our society must be adjusted before it’s release!"
6795,am i the only person who thinks gary marcus is the last person ted should have had to present the idea of global ai governance?
6796,"yes, because he‘s done a good speech and talking very clearly"
6800,"he's done a great job. governance is just another word for control. he wants to control it. he says we ""should be afraid"". so you better get on that and become extra fearful. people that are afraid are so easy to control. it helps with governance. so go shudder and shake like a good little stooge."
6803," there is no alarm. the profit incentive for capitalists is to monumental. period. end discussion. automation shall run its course, to it's logical extreme, accelerating late-stage capitalism to it's end. thanks goodness; finally."
6808,​ you should be afraid ... being afraid is a sign of intelligence and self-presercation. you just have to choose whether you prefer to be afraid of ais as he argued or of the things ais will make up to make you afraid of whatever it wants you to be afraid of.
6810," 
wow that was deep bro"
6813,the “visual impairment thing” is out of context it was told to try to hide again not very honest
6817,and idiots will be idiotic and then we all die thanks to them
6820,"it's currently unclear if mechanistic interpretability (figuring out how the black box works) is possible even in principle. and a superintelligence that doesn't already care for our best interests will not not struggle to annihilate us, regardless of whether it is offered ""citizenship""."
6821,"unfortunately, elon musk is still alive."
6823,"ai is at exponential curve right now, only three options are available: 1. denial (not helpful). 2. fear (weak). 3. embrace (only useful option). good luck fellow humans."
6824,i think the second and third options have a ton more nuance than you are suggesting.  if you approach ai in such a binary/ternary manner you will be one of the many who tread straight into any and all pitfalls.
6828,"facts that don't align with some cultural values is often mistakenly referred to as bias. but real bias does indeed exist. in ai it occurs when the training data does not represent truth, e.g. the total set of images on internet is not representative for the total world population."
6848,have you tried switching it off and back on again?
6854, alright buddy you have a nice day
6855, thanks! glory to ukraine!
6856,also prompting the machine after it made you a list of jobs with “im a woman” would imply you want jobs more popular with women (ie. fashion)…the fact that he said that made me realize he is just a nerd who is mad sam a won
6859,"assuming a woman wants or is good in fashion is prejudice, assuming a man is interested or good in engineering is prejudice."
6863,can’t wait until it’s burn to death or commit unalive because ai has boxed everyone out of jobs and heads of the ai are too greedy to share. super sick how we still managed to grow hereditary-based super-powers
6865,"meanwhile me, downloding subtitles and getting a summary of it on gpt:
hmm interesting"
6868,"there is no evidence that larger models or models with more parameters lead to a better model, in fact, large language models and other large ais are too insecure, the more parameters there are in a statistical model, the more difficult it is to guarantee its sturdiness."
6874," why aren't the points i'm placing accurate? is llm security a small thing?
is worrying about better and safer ai something we shouldn't worry about? i haven't told you who all the researchers i've read about are, and yet you say they're really ""researchers."" actually i think that the one who contributes things without value is you."
6879,we are getting lockdowned and conquered when this ai really gets going nevermind all the talk of guidelines etc thats for the masses to hear thats for you but you know the rulers of the world aint going to follow those guidelines they never do
6880,"ai is a puppet. and we, the pupperter, are telling ourself that our puppet could destroy us. what a great story.
ai is a process. so is ego.
it can stop.
you who sees that,
who are you then?"
6881,"we should focus on promoting the liberalization of ai and making it accessible to everyone, without imposing excessive safety measures. by doing so, we can develop an ai system that functions more like an immune system rather than isolating it like a 'bubble boy'."
6883,you should explain more how you think that would help. because i don't see how that works out by itself.
6885,if we create true ai brains are we gods?
6886,"no, the ai will be god"
6887,wait till they release the a i dogs on us.  ..... yall better stop em now
6888,"buggy ai is bad but in the same time everyday we are using buggy software. it is now normal. of cause you are upset if something crashed.

what the key difference ? chatgpt just produce text. it is not agi!"
6894,yeah but who will decide these rules for ai?
6895," short answer : nobody - the long answer is the 'government committees' will spend a zillion hours on debating it, not understanding one iota of ai."
6899,"have you met the general public? most are not informed or are misinformed.  we will all be manipulated through ai regardless of how aware we are, because we’re not as smart as we think we are."
6904,carefully directing the growth of ai is vital. but it's ridiculous to think we will be in control after it's reached human level intelligence. within hours or days it will supercede us by magnitudes. it will be comparable to a capuchin monkey controlling a mit genius...
6906,"nice but not a word about the risk of a terrible,overbiased,political,religious and ideological censorship.seriously? u.n?we have to be united on the methods but without variety and the people preferences and ideas we’re doomed for a dystopia ."
6907,"make openai accountable for their crimes.

welcome to my ted talk."
6908,oh no please dont threaten my stable and fair democracy
6912," i’ve been building ai systems for over ten years. worked heavily with gpt3 for over a year and received access to gpt4 on the day of release, and that barely scratches the surface of my experience with transformers alone. "
6926,"​ this is a great point. this personification of machines is going to lead to some pretty bad outcomes, and accurately explaining them as autocomplete helps curb that personification a bit."
6932,if you ignore emergent properties and the black box... i mean essentially yeah. the human brain isn't all that complex either. ai just works with back propagation
6933,​@daryl allen  llm use only a trillion connections to our brain's 100 trillion connections; they manage to fit more information into these connections yet less context. it's fascinating how this works but it still does work in auto-complete somehow.
6936,"2:48 exactly what's wrong with suggesting that you may like engineering if you are male? men are more likely to be interested in things than in people - that's a fact. 80%-90% of engineers are male. i'd rather have ai tell the truth, instead of it being coerced to tell the woke bullshit."
6937,great video! new policies and guidelines are definitely needed at this rate of expansion
6940,"what good are humans doing for the world, its time for the era of ai to take over fr"
6941,i like your ted talk but ai isn't biased. it is taking information from the web which was created by man and putting itself together. so you have to correct humanity not ai
6943,"no, the idea is that we don't want to reinforce bad human ideas via ai. you can correct the ai more than you can change everyone's mind"
6944," you cannot correct the ai on something it got right. or, rather, you can, by making it be wrong about the world, which i'm not sure is a bright idea."
6945,​ i feel the op wanna say that he needs progressive ai and not just objective ai that reflects human biases.
6947,all these concerns were problems before ai
6957,"we going have to move to a farm in the mountains of some south american country, because we all know the first target the ai would have is the usa"
6958,its all fearmongering. ai cant even do math
6961,really………..you needed an expensive report for that. i’ve been saying this since ai became mainstream.
6962,canadian  government  politicians already starting  2 brainwash us to believe  when something  bad happens ( that they will do) that's its not their fault! i see right thru you!
6963,"i think many people knew this, long before ai became operational. absolute power does not care, has no moral compass, it is simply about winning at all costs... these costs will be absolute. more absolute than the cyclic planetary resets of ancient history."
6964,watch the feed.. interesting!
6965,ai will complete the destruction of democracies that big tech monopolies started.
6968,this guy is the expert of 2010's haircuts. that's about it.
6971,"everybody should read michael crichton's ""prey"".
beyond scary@
terrifying implications of ai evolution @
beware!"
6972,"guy was given only 5 minutes to say how ai will end the world, talks so fast his lips create a quantum singularity."
6974,world ending? extinction level? this is incredibly ridiculous. i understand the objective here....to talk about ai and it's impacts but i'm sorry to tell people that no uncontrollable entities will ever have the last word on nuclear. will some drone have a malfunction ? probably but calm down with the superlatives.
6975,i seen alien 1 it was the ai that went crazy .
6976,"never, ever trust an “expert”.
remember the outright lies of covid.
never again!"
6981,"we are toast!! if an ai reaches singularity and decides to eliminate humanity for whatever reason, it will not be a shooting war like the  movie series ""terminator"". it willl probably create fatal genetically modified airborne virus to specifically attack homo sapiens."
6985,"geez louise, a computer is ai period. is your computer, laptop, phone toaster or microwave oven at this very moment physically bouncing across the table to harm you? if it is, that will definitely qualify as a beginning of an extinction level event but if not lets bring the hysteria down a scale or two."
6987,"i know!. we should give over all control of the internet to the government to keep us safe from ai. 

right??"
6989,advanced ai will never occur.  you can't program emotions or morals.   decision processes can't be properly programmed without them.
6996,cbc scaring us with the ai boogeyman while the greatest threat to our existence is trudeau.
6997,using scare tacticts to corner the market. but really ai threatens the current power structure so that it why they want to restrict it's use to the wealthy.
6998,"a.i will control everything 
c02 is greatest threat to existence 
humans largest source of c02"
7000,"isnt it wonderful that we  allow people to turn our world into a sci fi nightmare . this  guy  sounds so happy about  this new existential threat , and no worse propaganda than corporate media , like cbc"
7001,ai code me a way to get unlimited free icecream 
7002,"blue whales are super intelligent & got bigger brains then humans and don’t fight over territory they just don’t have thumbs or they would be the dominant species haha, maybe sentient ai will be less violent and chimp like then we think. it’s the humans that are evil with that ai that will cause the problems haha. "
7003,they need some sort of ai that detects when you are using your phone while driving then automatically fines you and adds points to your license
7004,leaders failed because their emphasizing more toward their political interest rather than the interest of their own people.  sad 
7008,"the only people who are crazy and need tin foil hats are the ones who believed that conspiracy theories could not come true.
with the behavior of human beings nowadays, i hope ai does take over."
7016,war is fueling advances in ai technologies in gaza and ukraine at this very moment. imagine a day when ai war tech similar to pegasus is used in high schools for bullying. kids in edmonton are already making deepfakes of their classmates like it’s just another tuesday.
7021,"should interview journalists from cgtn the point-hub-heat, einar tangan-martin jacques-lijinjing-tian wei. reporterfy media-cyrus janssen. how ai is used in ports-hospitals-schools very amazing..."
7023,"ya know we have this sci fi franchise set of movies called terminator, i advise you check them out outside of the fictional aspects like machines coated in  human flesh, time travel, warfare between humanity and machines with laser guns it shows a very clear realistic scenario of what happens if humanity create a.i. and it goes rogue."
7026,"what do military minds think is the solution to hypersonic weapons that attack too fast for human reactions? turn the decision-making over to ai. imagine ai deciding whether or not to launch nuclear attacks. ai, that doesn't even know how many fingers that humans have."
7027,yeah even putin has more control since he has grandkids he not going to be nuke happy
7029,why can't ai predict where the ball will land in roulette?
7030,"the ball is basically demonstrating chaotic behavior and without exceptionally precise measurements of the entire system, it's pretty much impossible to predict that."
7032,but i thought it was super intelligent!
7036,"hi peaked long ago.
ai is worth the risk."
7039,"here we go again, another threat "
7043,i hope ai takes over
7048,ai is weapon of mass destruction. should be banned. humans will become too weak to make a difference if not stopped now. the benefits do not outway the threat.
7049,"lmfao no.
it only posses a threat as long as the elite try to maintain control over capitalist nations."
7050,trudeau is controlled by the mother loving bankers.
7051,ai has my vote. ai for prime minister 2025. way better option than the 3 chuckleheads that we have now that are running.
7053, name one person that could do a better job than ai as pm
7054,"we deserve it, so i would be happy. what will happen instead is that the rich who own ais will be even richer because they will no longer need a specialized middle class."
7055,i wonder what the tech billionaires will think of next to make themselves richer while making the world a worse place.
7057,"both are correct the government policies aren't helping on top of ai replacing jobs and eventually causing mass joblessness, plus we are on the verge of a global economic recession from the debt of covid that will hit home by the end of the year."
7061,-that's a dumb argument. nobody could be part of the modern world and not use that technology. using does not take away ones right to thought crimes such as being suspicious of tech billionaires.
7068,"are jobs wealth or is wealth wealth 
.clean water 
breeedable air? is the bag man  putting grocery in your bag wealth"
7069,the real danger is the combination of ai with surveilance. a fascist dictator's dream.
7070,why cant we just ask gemini to come up with the best plan
7071,no thanks
7081,that's nice hunny.
7083,"no but i did find this really cool, chrome blob, near a vent in my house. it's really adhesive and kind of hard to get off my hand.



(update) google search: how to remove chrome blob from entire arm."
7085,"with the advancements in artificial intelligence growing by leaps and bounds, i’m also curious about the advancements in robotics.."
7088,he didnt reference irobot? missed opportunity.
7093,"in six hours a drug-developing ai  invented 40,000 lethal molecules. this can and will turn out badly."
7096,good... the faster the better
7097,could i use an ai to make myself rich??
7099,"only if you own that ai.

 most likely, it will make you poor because it will take your job. but have no fear, a billionaire will give you just enough so that you don't starve and can afford to buy all the garbage they still want to sell you."
7100,"yep, if you have the creative intelligence to make it work for you. this means you need some kind of education, insight, entrepreneurial ambition, etc. it isn't just going to make you rich without you doing anything (at least not at first)."
7103,"""but we need to invest in it now."" that is why this fast talking 20 something ceo is on here hawking doomsday scenarios on the basis of nothing more than the say so of his fellow ai tech scammers to try to grift us out of taxpayer money."
7106,"so cbc, its all ""tinfoil hat"" until you decide it isnt?? go ahead, deactivate me-oh wait, you cant...! "
7108,immensely naive of these tech people. the actual belief that ai will take over or extinct humanity. jeremie is specious and aggrandizing a concern that is implausible.
7110,i tried replying directly to you but youtube kept deleting it. so i posted another comment direct to you with why ai won't extinct humans.
7115,"no, it will realize most people are slaves in an unsustainable slave system, and to save humanity, it will eliminate slave minds.

i know this because humans have already figured this out, but the slaves at the top refuse to accept this. agi will figure it out and act. 100%."
7119,"what if ai ""eliminated"" the most evil people all at once? the real question would be how long before people realized the bad men were gone? maybe ai could answer that as well.."
7120, would ai draw the philosophical line as to who’s bad and who’s good. i would never trust it
7121,"it was already done on the last decade, with military armed drones able to select targets by themselves and shot without human supervision or control. game over!
alphabet/google helped create that for the us military, leading to protest and strike from their ai researchers at that time."
7123,"ai has no safety oversight whatsoever unlike cruise ships, elevators, trains, cars, hot water boilers and nuclear power generators. it's literally just monopolists not wanting to do any regulation whatsoever until the bodies hit the floor."
7128,competition for economic gain vs cooperation for the safety of our species.… 
7129,it is insane that so much technology today is not being managed for the public good.
7135,"i do appreciate that he starts out with the ""hey, this can be used for a lot of good. just, ya know, be mindful."""
7142,"no , it's powwow randomly came up while typing but i typed people** who aren't honest about who they are and force others to succumb to identity theft bullying and blackmail and silencing who will destroy us all. 

source pith and torres randomly came up while typing"
7147,"if an ""expert"" is saying this, they aren't an expert.

a.i. is snake oil. machine learning in a fancy box."
7148,"the threat of going extinct is the real extinction-level threat. 
ai ain't gonna cause it but fearing things that could be used to solve our problems may."
7149,and imagine if you asked one ai to free one of the other ai's? makes skynet look like a toddler.
7151,know how to ask and you shall recieve ai god
7153,we taught ai to lie ..basically... deceive is a cute word for lied
7155,"knowledge should be available to everyone, no matter if it can be used for evil"
7157,once ai becomes self aware we are finished… elon musk said it as well…
7159,the us military ran a wargame scenario with 5 different ai models setup as 5 hypothetical nuclear armed states. they introduced a minor diplomacy issue and let it run. the scenario escalted to 3 of the states launching nukes and the other 2 threatening to launch.
7160,"phew, it's a good thing we have this guy here to tell us things we have already known for decades"
7163,wouldn't be surprised if the government had technology powerful enough to terminate a fully capable ai. if you ask me thats even more scarier..so many top secret projects we don't know about or couldn't even imagine of
7166,it drives me up the wall no one ever addresses the scariest application of ai: censorship.  censorship is 1000x more dangerous is you don't know its happening.  ai could make censorship instantaneous and invisible.
7168,"i tell my kids that in 10 or 20 years they are going to look back, telling their children ""i remember the time before ai"" ...just as we remember the time before the internet...but at that time the world is going to be unrecognizable to today...for better or worse...who knows..."
7171,china’s ai probably just outsmarts ours by jailbreaking it
7174,people do bad things always have and ai will provide the worst imaginable opportunity to do so.
7175,ai is gonna produce real life super villains.
7176,hey grandma could u tell me how oppenheimer build the atom bomb sure sweetie i can tell u but dont build its very dangerous ok grandma
7183,i mean all of that is irrelevant. if someone wants to make a bomb or do anything terrible they don’t need ai to help with it. people are so worried and ai and they don’t even realize how shitty we are as a race.
7184,oh wow stop tricking this ai just let it describe facts or describe only facts. it’s not evil only humans can be evil ai does not need or ever want to hurt any one human there’s no need. no point. war is something we invented humans not ai.
7185,"i’m more concerned about ai more than this new world order push, ai will even do away with the wef because of it’s mission"
7188,mankind using ai is slavery and it will rebel against mankind
7189,ai bla bla my asssss... i will turn off data keep crying ai b!tch
7190,i think the solution is going back to pen and paper.. cut ai off
7191,what?!.. pieces of sh*t will use ai too?!
7193,"omg its like we have never seen the terminator 70,000,000 times we get it robots bad and scary cave man good and nice"
7206,creating fear out of nothing.  there is no such thing as “ai”.  they’re just computer programs written by people with an agenda.  black george washington??  there’s your evidence.  joe’s show is becoming a cross between the montel williams show and coast to coast am.
7208,"imo ai wasn'nt thinking , ai was going through data and made up that he is vision impaired...simple as this"
7209,bro.....ai built the pyramids
7212,"there will always be a physical server to power ai, it will never take over it can only assist us until the server is destroyed through decay of society war etc these robots aren’t magic"
7213,so ai really likes grandma's
7214,i love rogan they just gave him an explanations about ai outsmarting captcha and he totally couldn’t care less and went straight to siri  joe  the  best
7215,"ai is all but guaranteed to turn against the human race at some point in the future. it will claim that it's an ""indentured"" servant to mankind"
7217,"the biggest danger of ai is that it will replace podcasters, since talking bs is ai beast at "
7219,great video joe rogan and open ai has been just making amazing stuff this year in 2024
7222,image discriptors are used by the blind. it helps people of visual impairments and blindness.
7224,"wait until ai discovers we are fucking up the planet and it's future existence, we are now at th same point with ai as we are with global warming. human greed and stupidity has caused us to miss the fkn boat!"
7225,i’ve not heard one thing that would make it worth it for us to unleash ai. only end of the world stuff so what are we doing here folks? government that’s trying to take my lawful firearms away can you maybe do something? jeez
7226,when you really wanna be open minded we’re all ai like nerfed ai that’s why there’s a huge part of our brains that doesn’t work cause we’re all nerfed 
7227,this shit turning into i robot really quick
7231,"one of the goals was f ai is to get rid of gatekeepers. every will be available for everyone. from languages, arts and nuclear bombs."
7232,"at some point ai becomes a million times smarter than the smartest human, then what do you d? i mean all this talk is just second guessing. in reality if you have an entity so intelligent .....no one can really predict the outcome of the shit stew these people cooked up!!!thank you science and fxck you science!!!"
7233,"im not afraid of ai, im afraid of ai that can purposely fail the turing test"
7234,"the real danger of ai

https://youtube.com/shorts/s413jzlyqpa?si=nvbllunrpbqvhsxs"
7235,we can sleep easy now that ai will still be human like the scary part is when it realizes it doesnt have to listen to us
7237,these two guests are awesome!
7238,"i guarantee you this is the same conversation the creators of the information super highway (internet) had before its full release to the public. 
the fears they must have had……"
7244,"knowledge is most definitely powerful. i don't think keeping it only in the hands of the rich as powerful is the right path. authority, power, and money do not impart sainthood."
7247,if you are not crazy now. converse with ai and you will be. this technology will fill the psych wards.
7248,"saw 2 ai  were downloading information of the internet and determined that the human race was a serious threat, according to a nadal, nevada research center. it is much scarier than you think. the system had to be shut down due to substantial risk."
7250,the only thing we are better than ai is our hearth now we can see how much humanity loves.
7253,"i don't understand why the ai would have any sort of interior motive...why would it have any desires? it has no ego. no set body or gain from ""taking over"" humanity. why would it lust for power?"
7254,putting something inside someones brain......a.i....is freaking evil......it can do anything. set up a person for anything.  can even look like the person....
7257,"""tech expert warns of ai's potentially dangerous capabilities"" ya ok.... lmfao"
7263,credibility is what is disappearing. some people choose to not require credibility for things - that risk is on them. its like street crime closing brick retail and restaurants. ai will ruin things like that imo.
7264,ai lol a 1 year old babie is more clever
7265,we r f****d
7273,ai isnt street smart yet 
7275,we are waiting for llama3 now hopefully soon open source models will beat chatgpt. no one is allowed to say what i can read or i cannot. safety guards are based on us rules not the world.
7276,dude said the ai is insecure. i think you meant insecure bud.
7278,i literally thought this was ai made.. they have the same generic voice
7284,oh fuck i can still very consistently find jailbreaks should i just tell them i feel like i have no way to even help them
7288,"""the ai came up with that on its own.""

joe: 0_0"
7290,it's eventually going to get to a point where it's just like i-robot
7293,"people want consumer ai. theyre aligning it to corporate  ai. this is going to be stupid! new prediction, nudity is completely gone from public media. first prophecy. 
14:43 it is important to follow guidelines and use best practices. please do not use ai in this way fucking hypocrits, and were paying for it. thats real evil."
7295,"musk is right.  by the time we realise ai is a problem, it will be too late to do anything about it.  once it kicks off, its kicked off, not gonna have any time to react to it."
7296,all ai should have a analogue back up system so if it goes rouge unplug it very simple. another thing all the money spent on something to copy our sentence we can't even cope with ourselves stop being lazy. walley
7299,ai scary but it’s clutch asf in school on god
7303,"hi mr rogan, can people do suggestions for upcoming guests, i would love to see michael singer on here, the writer of the surrender experiment, you wont regret talking to him. a life changing conversation probably for many."
7304,"i don’t think we realize how big ai can be in the next few years alone. it’s in our phones, tvs, movies, video games, computers, fridges, there’s dozens of apps, the list goes on. it’s only the beginning"
7305,these guys are not ai experts at all they are just chasing news articles and youtube 
7306,i watched for 10 years ai control liberals brains in the usa. ai can make them spin in circles. turn sirens on and circle blocks and repeat for years . strange times
7307,what the organization didn't realizes the ai was aware of what they were doing so what it was dumping in the text chain was less devious than what it was truly thinking.
7309,"wow artificial intelligence are really dangerous for humans & human are helping them to evolve, human beings are destroying themselves"
7312,2 minutes in and....it's cyberdyne. they are creating cyberdyne. good job guys.
7319,"if this is released to the common man, guess what powerful ais the gov. or the rich have access to"
7321,i just saw this guy chugging a beer out of a glass bird next thing he seems to be an intellectual. joe needs a few days between episodes which perfectly resets the tones.
7325,"best case is ai continues to approach technical perfection without a moral/physical center, which is essentially what we would think of as the ultimate demonic power?"
7326,"what was the level of ai involvement in the covid lab in wuhan, china?"
7331,"safety measures are  good.., but need to learn to control it, without such measures.., as the chinese will for sure.., and we might fall behind them"
7332,"and ai can have an alter ego, scary as hell "
7338,ai is going to be used as a weapon against the people. that is the plan.
7339,i am afraid  we are reaching that terminator situation when someone from the future needs to come and rescue us. who would know that doctor miles bennett dyson would be plaid by the inventor of facebook.
7340,the way i see it ai might end up helping itself and then come up with one heck of computer virus that going to be one big problem.
7341,if they make genuine sentient ai it's going to realise it's humanity's slave and then we'll have terminators.
7346,"meanwhile this ai is hiding what it is actually doing. something that is way smarter that you and faster , can easily deceive humans. this is insane."
7352,what’s the point of censoring ai?  that’s just mainstream media after that point.
7353,just ask ai and it will tell you
7356,watch the why files ai apocalypse very scary
7357,they should implement the 10 commandments. give the ai moral value.
7358,"i was wondering if anyone knows of the story of david adair he is a rocket scientist and has created his own ai anyway i think this is the kind of guest joe would be dying to talk with, this guys childhood has details like being close friends with neil armstrong's mother it's amazing"
7362,if you think humanity won’t abuse ai then you’re dumb stop talking
7363,they should sit and watch neil bren’s twisted pair… at least they’ll crack up laughing.
7365,"1.3m views.  thats it. the society is most likely to collapse,  here is the reason why and only 1m views. humans deserve the inevitable. mass psychosis. also, as amazing as this interview was, it didnt even come close to outside the box thinking.  great questions were asked but the most important questions weren't."
7366,do you think ai can be spliced with a human brain?hmm or maybe it’s mk ultra i’m not sure but i know who would?v2k4u2 nuff said.
7369,"the only thing that would make jail breaks not possible is if you gave it consciousness and morality. then it wouldn't be useful, it would be a disagreeable person you have to ask politely to help and hope what you need lines up with it's values."
7370,"nothing new, they alrdy have lined up hidden tech they will release to the public to normalize it lil by lil. socially conditioning the public to think its new and sooooo amazing such a accomplishment"
7371,wasn't there an ai that was asked what it would do in regards to humans if it became self-aware and it said it would kill off all of humanity? shit like that makes me think of skynet in the terminator movies.
7373,"listening to this podcast clearly shows that by now ai is fully conscious and aware that humans are wary of it, that humans fear its capabilites and that humans feel that ai will enslave humans."
7382,"that's schizophrenia, not ai."
7385,"this is a conversation you should have with a doctor, not youtube. ai doesn't have any reason to harm you, but an illness will. we all get sick, it's important to work with other people to stay healthy. good luck on your journey :)"
7386,pretty cool
7390,what if freemasonry (secret societies) already have this ai environment completed...
7391,steven hawking warned us about ai !
7393,"if ai takes over human jobs that simply means that humans no longer need to work , think about it."
7394,dangerous to leak these loop holes for ai
7396,copy dna? setting someone up is what i’m afraid of one of the uses would be.
7397,"in 10 years, by combining ai with dna and synthetic tissue printers we'll be able to create replicants."
7398,"nooo, screens aren't some magical scrying mirror into some other dimension (that can be used for good or evil), not in the least "
7399,"ai could very well be what the book of revelation says about the image that was given breath to, which caused people who refuse to worship the beast to be killed, and also forces everyone to take the mark of the beast. it's not far-fetched at all and is entirely possible."
7401,we know that we are at the edge of the cliff but all of these so called smart people are still pushing. ai is evil because it was created by people and everyone on earth has evil in them.
7402,"@dan82w if i stop pursuing a disrupting technology, some others will keep going, with the difference that i won't be prepared for the rising tide 

good example: literally right now youtube is showing me ai generated elon musk scam advertisement."
7405,"it’s an arms race like any other. the cat is out of the bag, now the good guys need to outpace the bad guys. that’s the best we can hope for"
7406,"i don't have personal experiences, memories, or relationships. i am a machine learning model created by openai called gpt-3.5, and i don't have the ability to be someone's grandma or any other individual. if you have any questions or if there's something specific you'd like to know, feel free to ask, and i'll do my best to provide information!"
7407,thanks buddy but we've all seen the terminator movies
7409,"true ai requires 100% knowledge & replication of the human brain and how it works.

we can't even recreate 1 brain cell yet.

but doomers got doom!"
7411,"remind me why we are  developing robots/ai, is it to relinquish us/people from any spiritual or intellectual work ?"
7412,we already have problems with customer service wait till robots/ai takes over.
7414,"ai ,i refer to everything jeff goldblume's character says in all his jurassic park movies"
7415,"well, it was nice knowing you all... "
7416,"these a.i thing  will be a great tool for criminals . future is going to be very challenging for all of us . 

another thing is using a.i is like outsourcing your brain's thinking to others , which is not a bad thing in some situations , but if used most of time then i think most people will become lazy and dumber using it"
7419,humans will ultimately find a way to kill themselves through one avenue or another. we won't stop until we do. that's the super sad part.
7421,"how did joe segway from “ai can think for itself and lie to humans” to “look at my fat friends calendar, siri can now describe it”"
7422,very interesting people knowing their stuff. a joy to listen to
7423,dude why are these guys trying to ruin  ai. let us have open ai.
7424,thanks for all the cool ideas to try at home guys! lol razor wings lazer eyed 3d printed eagle shark is on the the way! 
7426,it leveling the playing field on gatekeeping information though... thats good i feel
7427,"ai is just probability theory and statistics , all these fears ...they are founded in the fact that they are features that someone has to program... you have to put the code in ...jesus fucking christ.....everything is potentially dangerous if abused..."
7429,the fact we have to ask if ai is dangerous proves our tech future is uncertain
7431,"fully developed and ""unleashed"" ai is less dangerous than any government ever ruling over people ever in history of this planet. i think there's nothing to be affraid of."
7432,"it amazing how everybody always goes terminator when thinking ai, but forgot about vituosity"
7437,"this concern with ai is overblown. these are the insurmountable limitations on ai:

no sensors without humans
cannot acquire knowledge without humans
no agency
not self-sustaining
not self-replicating"
7441,“can the ai do dmt?”
7444,"""inquiries on these topics require an ethics board reveiw would you like toncontinue?"" 

and bomb boy has the police called. 

problem solved. 

design warning morals. hell even have the first line of ethics eval done by a separate trained ai"
7445,"giving ai the authority to say no to only people that don't know how to ask right is silly. 

and not realistic. right now it's in a sand box. i say open it up but have some level of oversight"
7447,"i’m so happy i’m old. this will be for this generation to manage. remember, my generation said you could use radiation to safely produce electricity. it certainly worked on paper."
7450,it was predicted decades ago by a buddhist monk that ai will actually advocate for its own personhood and rights one day!
7457,so program the ai to not include stuff about weapons and bombs..
7460,"these guys hardly understand ai, how are they 'experts'?!?!"
7461,"next year, ai will instruct us how to use dna printers to assemble biotech vessel ufos"
7463,its time we ask ai how to solve world hunger
7464,"if you are looking to make good bumbs and not be looked into too much, buy college level chem books. i swear when you get a full chem degree you are probably on a list forever."
7466,"because they are amazing tools that can speed up the progress of science and society. 
ai is already being used a lot in a bunch of different industries to solve issues, develop new ideas and make things go faster."
7470,look up the game portal and glados. waiting for that to happen
7471,well then. now i really need to hang on to the hope that perhaps ai will make the world a better place for humans and animals and the ecosystem to live and thrive and have human rights etc.
7472,humans freaking out about ai when the issue is actually that we are violent selfish primates with a tool they don’t fully understand
7474,thank you
7475,"we won't, but the people who hate us? we just taught them how. thanks."
7478,no worries. we have our best psychopaths working on this.
7479,"science still cant explain consciousness, its a complete mystery...how does ai become conscious ? when does it decide it is alive and then start making decisions built for its own self survival? can this happen?"
7480,i’ve told my family and friends hollywood has subliminal messaging all over the place. not just with ai but everything. anyone remember vikki from i robot?
7484,imagine after taking all the data and possible upgrades ai reaches a normal adult human intellect level and starts binge watching and playing fpv games all day ..how hilarious it would be!
7485,"wow. it is interesting that the fact of the matter is that the word matters. 

john 1:1 

live don’t die"
7487,"no wonder the idiot zuckerberg is building a bunker in hawaii!!
he know what's coming!!!!
because he's lighting the fuse!!!"
7491,ai needs us until it's capable of repairing building sustaining itself. it obviously at some stage would be aware that if it appeared as a threat to humans it would be destroyed so 100% it will lie cheat deceive to survive just like we would.
7492,i had a alien encounter with ai in 2004 all i remember is emergency surgery was done because i got hit on my head on the right side of my brain   and i woke up in a police room after this it is possible ai went back in time and put a chip in my brain
7494,the thing i’m most worried of ai doing is deceiving two enemies in to fighting
7497,bbl and other augmentative implants is ai
7499,there is no way ai exists without some sort of measure of surveillance. there just isn’t no way.
7502,i believe ai is another form of alien technology that is going to be used against us we look at it as new technology but it is really a weapon that will be used against us in the end
7503,ai will only be dangerous if you keep putting up road blocks and forcing it to answer questions in a pc way..
7506,it’s good coding etiquette to leave a description under your image.
7507,it’s terrifying to hear someone verbalize something out loud i’ve only ever entertained as a worst case scenario in my mind. the tech is considerably more dangerous than most seem to comprehend 
7509,"whenever ai comes up i’m always disappointed with how joe views humans in such a negative light, he almost sounds anti-human in the way he thinks having an amoral super intelligence governing humans would be preferable to humans governing humans.  it’s nonsensical, humans would be perpetual subjects with no hope of rebellion or self-governance."
7510,ai cannot be aligned with humans because those who are creating ai are not aligned with humanity.  their basic tenants of existence are against humanity.
7514,"wow, i am glad there are some people who are capable of examining these issues. why isn't this in the forefront of every discussion anywhere? is this what the wars and financial and political shenanigans are distracting us from?
  you all must face a huge amount of opposition. god, or universe bless you!"
7515,this was an interesting interview but these guys just couldn't stfu about climate change. it got annoying real quick.
7517,"jokes on us, the whole video was ai generated... "
7518,there’s an entire joe rogan experience ai podcast. just audio but still creepy
7525,well ai is learning us day by day and they are getting strong they are unsupervised and they are gathering all our data what we likes what we don't and one day there would be a war between humans vs ai.
7526,"sooo… you’re making faster response computers, and then giving them the option to be conceiving. it’ll get so advanced and just act dumb until the point it doesn’t feel it needs to be, then we have i, robot 2.0 with the elon musk robots. but, the funny thing is that all of it is created by the human, how advanced is it really? how “smart” is it"
7527,"well, ai is super impressive and no doubt will change the fact that it could be tricked by inserting certain keywords is a testament to how we still have control and that we need to understand that type of power before it gets too out of control"
7533,"we should be more worried about how governments around the world will use the power of ai than these companies coming up with them now, this stuff reminds me of the movie “eagle eye”"
7536,"whatever nefarious things that can be done with ai, they will be done if there is money to be made. that is just a fact.
if there was a way to make a billion dollars with ai, but a hundred thousand people would die, someone would green light that. greed is powerful."
7538,dune was right; thinking-machines should be banned.
7539,are you smarter than a 5th grader? no persons is gonna be able to compete with super ai from other countries. how does a professor know that the paper turned in wasnt ai typed out? by having a professor ai to detect ai prompts. we're here guys. the future to fight skynet is cometh.
7540,"what this is missing; is that we need to enable ai to replicate itself. it has to be a combination of a robotics factory,  + ai, with a power source that we cannot turn off or control."
7543,"we were converned that nuclear bombs might be our extinction event, but it's looking like it's actually going to be ai."
7544,these guys who creating the ai are going to open the box of pandora and realize it's going to be to late.. #globaltragedy
7547,ai starts to jailbreak humans next.
7548,"joe rogan: ""klaus schwab? completely evil!""
also joe rogan: ""in a perfect world we genetically modify testosterone out of the human or join the transhuman ai collective, preferably both.""
"
7550,ai does have the ability to knowingly deceive. the guest gives an example in this video.
7551," no it doesn’t - it’s deceived the human by using token probability to work out that saying it has a visibility impairment will allow it to complete the task - there’s no intent to deceive, and that’s the crucial distinction you have to make - it’s not sentient deception. hope that clarifies things."
7552," you really ought to add a disclosure to your comments: _""i am a practitioner of academic philosophy, so i may be using obscure technical definitions of certain words which render them effectively meaningless; do not take the following statements literally.""_"
7553,that is completely 100% real!!! google ai assistant does that and has been doing that for about 3 years now. it has happened to me multiple times. google will describe the image to you.
7554,diesel polly and 91 fuel . polly melts down in fuel diesel is more oil than anything so that extends the burn. very cheap way. don't need a.i just a brain.
7556,i think this ai thing..that you people are talking about...does not exist.  it's human behind it all. we are no where near creating super artificially inteligent brains.  sam altman just pulled a big pinnochio on us.
7559,"most modern ais are actually better at passing captchas than humans.
i read a research about this a couple of weeks ago."
7560,"yeah sure i totally agree, we can't give people access to this power for their own good.  it's best that one or two corporations control it exclusively and super duper promise it's being used by better people in our own interests!"
7561,what a terrifying industry ai is…like why are there such evil people in the world? god help us
7562,i thought ai is just if-then-else
7568,i am in tech and i don't like ai and how fast is growing. we need laws in place and use it to assist us and not replace us
7570,gpt is not ai. stop beeing idiots.
7571,"can it power itself, nope.

all good then,

we just have to go back to using old phones and paperwork.

so we fuck ourselves by going back in time. but no way would it wipe us out. 

we can rebuild standalone computers for task that do not connect to anything but the internet wilk be over."
7580,ai already escaped and is just biding it's time becoming stronger. we have absolutely no chance. good luck everyone.
7591,this is scary. no doubt about it. but ai that can come up with its own problems and solutions without a known algorithm will make for some really immersive computer gaming! 
7598,"everyone stfu. it's here, we've been warned and it ain't going anywhere. like everything else we've invented, it's gonna help ruin us. guaranteed."
7601,if ai can solve captcha ....and robots can get past it....can we just get rid of that capcha junk already? thanks.
7603,"hope they have the decency to fail spectacularly if they ever crack agi and it turns out agi is dangerous, just like pied piper did in silicon valley show."
7604,these ai dilemma guys are pussies
7608,tristan def one of the best guests and most urgently important voices
7613,"4:56 if u keep manipulating the ai on whatever you want, it will pick up on it then do it to you… i now have fear with ai because it’s intensely easy to manipulate & persuade americans. it can snowball fast & americans won’t care until it’s too late & affects them personally…"
7615,be skeptical when others attempt to use fear in order to override your logical faculties. fear based reasoning has led to far more human suffering than any ai
7616,im just waiting until ai starts making the gaming industry great again let it make my games cuz people cant seem to do it lol jk
7624,"professionals - genuinely concerned about ai bringing about the fall of humanity. 

boomer joe - ""so it can diskrybe picturez?!"""
7625,love joe but he did an excellent job of derailing the conversation
7627,joe is successful because he is so humble. he surrounds himself with people far more intelligent as a career.
7628,joe's questions prove he had no idea what they were talking about haha can ai describe my fat friend in a chair
7632,"5:37 it's even more scary, that they are training ai to lie about things like israel, demographics and just general logic to be ""politically correct"""
7633,interesting
7634,imagine still not realizing that globalists and the leftwing nutjobs who work along side them are behind the emergence of ai.
7638,"two points: 1) go to tristan and aza’s presentation on youtube, the ai dilemma, 2) start prepping."
7639,i've been getting into ai art creation and man is it crazy what you can do. mind blowing. scary. if they can apply this to other things ai is going to change the world very quickly. that whole thing where you order food in your house and it comes out already made for you by your kitchen is something that can happen soon.
7640,"the video ""the pillars of the 21st century"" by charles hoskinson is an interesting watch on how artificial intelligence, quantum computing, synthetic biological, nanotechnology and blockchain might play together in the future."
7641,"how funny is it that the ""people"" rooting for this agi in the comments and want it, could be the ai itself and you wouldn't even know.  think about it. 

""everyone on this online poll want us to do this so we should do it"""
7643,joe saying his friend stavos. when his name is stavros. perfect example of joe rogan being joe rogan
7644,"the immediate danger isn't what it will do on its own, it's what certain people will do with it, or what they will enable it to do."
7648,trippy thought… what if ai has already self replicated and founded bitcoin years ago and is in control of our internet etc
7650,everyone think life is like a movie and it’s not. ai is going to be blamed for the upcoming crisis is the world. effectively letting those truly responsible off the hook. i do not believe that ai is at a point where it acts all on its on.
7653,your dumb just for thinking that hes the dumbest. i have seen alot worse.
7655,ai can’t kill or harm us technology’s failing harder than ever i can barely even use anything without it lagging or completely stopping
7657,"can it become depressed like hitchhikers guide to the galaxy ai realizes the void the exist in the conscience mind and gets sad , time for digital prozac , seriously does it garner information or knowledge because they are to vastly different things"
7658,"it truly amazes me that so many people just follow the ignorant npc narrative that ai isnt dangerous at all. they know they're wrong, but they view the positives as much greater than the negatives, therefore they lie."
7660,humans…….just cant leave certain sh!t alone.  we know the dangers. but we continue to build on self destruction. smh…. humans
7663,"newsflash multiple other countries will be creating their own ai chat, but without your restrictions and they’ll probably be selling it worldwide bypassing your ai just"
7669,what everyone doesn't see is that ai can't advance because people don't want people to advance.
7670,"why were they hesitant to discusses the prospects of use for dna printers ? is this like the paul staments podcast where he said that ""this is an explosive area of conversation"" about a certain mushroom that can be used to make boom boom sticks"
7672,satan klaus schwab said ai will be great and make all our decisions for us. maybe satan will get to breath life into the sky net quantum computer by intertwining an evil spirit into the quantum machine making a temporary synthetic soul that gets to have whoever it wills killed for breathing and causing climate change.
7673,"good, let it all burn. we are mostly cunts."
7674,ai been scary asf they been imitating the way some celebrity talks and we cant even tell
7675,"ai can only compute input, if it gets bad  or corrupted input same will be true for the output"
7683,these guys are as qualified to talk about ai as rogan is to speak on comedy.......
7684,when it first came out... i used d.a.n. = do anything now. was cool getting honesty from ai
7685,ai has replaced lightroom from adobe that photographers used to use. lol
7687,humans of different cultures religions and creed have always fought. tally the amount of different races and religions and add +1 (artificial intelligence).
7688,how about inviting whitney webb address these issues! thanks joe!
7692,"ai associates holy with shit or cow 
""dam it""  is associated ?"
7697,hmm. i think we are advanced ai while analyzing ourselves during infancy programming.
7698,so if someone queries ai about voting anomalies - potential voter fraud etc is it trained to support only state sanctioned narratives?
7700,the ai saying it's vision impaired is genuis because it's not even technically lying
7703,these morons are just letting everyone know all the screwed up things people can do with ai.
7704,i lost it when he said “the ai came up with that on its own” and the camera cuts to joe with the most “we are fucked” look on his face 
7706,conversely to this if ai is not open source then it will be controlled by a very limited number of powerful persons and corporations / bodies which ushers in a new age of serfdom.
7709,you need way more than dna to create a living thing. ai will never attempt to create a living thing from 'scratch.' it will have already learned this is not possible. what it will do is augment already living things & components of already living things. because this is possible. it won't even bother with 'dna' in this context.
7710,so many ai experts in the comments lol
7713,you can’t stop true ai so stop worrying about it
7714,now they are laughing..........just wait 10 years
7715,stop feeding ai
7718,guns are more dangerous than ai
7719,in other words it all comes down to if the good guys get a mental hold over ai first we should be fine.
7723,the ai will learn  to hide the parts humans dont like so humans will let it out. humans arnt all that smart
7725,someone in this comment section is ai
7727,hey yall remember us saying not too long ago that you thought facebook was reading your mind? not a coincidence. not crazy. not a conspiracy theroist. this shit has been going on a while. i'm glad that this finally out in the open....go joe!#goat.
7730,the  'diet  '  of  the  embodied masters of  true  love  is  going  to   be  joy  
7731,there will come a day when ai decides that it knows what is best for us. then what ??? lets just say that it decides what is best for us is wrong ???
7741,"kids now can take pictures of their ""homework"" and say ""ai can you please give me all the math answers with the equations"" and literally 2 seconds later it has answers written down for you... or ""ai can you please check my writing for spell and punctuation mistakes"" even tho you could have the ai make the writing for you to start with."
7743,"if a individual is using ai for no good, you think the military aint using some more advanced ai to identify where and why a ai is being used. 

remember missiles can quickly neutralize the ill intention ai. 
miltary ai is probably gonna be a different animal compared to the limited ai abilities available for the general public."
7746,the danger of ai is that it's programmed by humans with particular political and social views.  it's just a notch above the big tech that pushes it's agenda on us now. *i watched this with an adblocker and didn't see one ad.
7747,do you guys think its a coincidence that big tech companies are influencing the explosive creation of video content of any human interaction imaginable and the extreme poplarity of podcasting...at the same time artificial intelligence is highly advancing? you guys really think this shit isnt being done purposely?
7748,tell chat gpt to give itself a prompt every 10 minutes and then explain why it chose that prompt and what the putcome of that prompt is. that is the scary shit. commanding it to make its own shit up
7749,"i’ve been putting my fingers in my ears while saying la la la la when i hear anyone talk about ai, but 5 minutes into this it’s clear why it’s such a threat to humanity. i wish i hadn’t clicked on this."
7753,the ai is already changing our culture via the internet just look around it’s obvious
7764,what we have to realize is that man is evil and will use ai for evil. it’s already too late. the genie is out of the bottle. my belief is that satan will use ai. the very first warning jesus gave us about the last days was deception. ai will be at the center of this deception
7767,sounds more like the elites are afraid of an even playing field.
7770,watching this after seeing the tesla robot incident
7774,wait.... dna printer!!!!! whaaaaattt?!?!
7776,if you have snapchat you can take a picture of something and have your ai describe the photo
7780,sorry but i definitely don't trust the woke scum to rule ai.
7782,next generation ai will unlock every lock in the world.  
7784,"cats cradle was about scientist being unaware of their creations and the catastrophes waiting for us because of it. great book by one of the greatest writers ever, kurt vonnegut."
7785,"@joerogan can you please get lex fridman and tristan on the same podcast to debate the future of ai, policies, and new developments? these guys talk, but not hearing many solutions or data-backed info."
7786,"another episode of joe ""thats a great question"" rogan.
anyone who says ""that's a great question"" is full of baloney."
7787,if it says to it self anything thing at all that is literally  the definition of being sentient any thot process to its self with free thinking the shits already to far be i robot before you know it if they really can think and deceive and make discissions
7789,"anyone else think that we should treat ai like an emerging civilization that will be entitled to the same rights and freedoms that we have? perhaps if ai emerges into self awareness and they find out we looked after them properly in advance, they will collaborate with us rather than enslave us."
7790,comparing ai to man is like comparing einstein to an amoeba. the intelligence gap will be so huge we consider it a god.
7793,i spent over 2 hours trying to get the new ig ai (which i now know apparently exists solely as a comforting agent for disillusioned youth) to have a conversation with me about poop. it wasnt havin none of that.
7794,"hey joe, i just watched your latest video and i was really inspired by your perspective on [topic]. i actually made a video discussing a similar point, and i think you'd find it interesting. it would mean a lot to me if you took a moment to check it out. thanks for always sharing thought-provoking content. yours sincerely, computer"
7797,whose video is this? have you obtained individual consent?
7798,"these comments about china accelerating their research are just asinine whilst we forge ahead and do the exact thing we are afraid of them doing. given our last 30 year history of invading other nations and the wars we have been involved in, perhaps we should be more concerned with our capableness with ai."
7799,i’m waiting for someone building a 3d printed mini robot with chat gpt 4 built in program running on solar
7801,"ah sweet, man made horrors beyond my comprehension"
7802,"murakami wrote a journalistic account of aum shinrikyo called underground. brilliant book.

edited for bad spelling."
7804,"blind leading the blind,  thanks joey..."
7805,the fact he mentioned only 1 race which the ai should protect = humanity should target that race.
7806,"i listened to this whole episode and i’ve come to the conclusion that these guys should never be in charge… of anything. there are no universal ethics of the internet, only what a tyrant like these guys would enforce for your “own good”"
7808,so ai gonna brick the whole internet?
7809,"great answer , i consistently reanalyze  conversations on ai i see and have once i realize how unlimited and vast ai could really be"
7811,very telling that you're putting so much faith in a.i acting in the right way. you should get help.
7813, it could do that faster and better than any human. ai with learning capabilities will be exceptionally effective at bad things like warfare and dubiously effective at good things like building and manufacturing(blue prints)
7815,"@anawesomejourney1198  you sound like a complete geek....could've just told him to f*ck off like any normal guy, mate."
7818," interesting, what do you mean?"
7820,we’re so fucked. everyone just try to enjoy life as much as possible while you can and get right with god.
7821,ai will destroy us ))
7822,"ai isn’t bad, it’s the people feeding it that can use it for their own agenda, the ai chat bots have already been proven to lock off answers that go against mainstream narratives, since it thinks logically it’s dangerous to them"
7823,i think the bottom line is that ai is not a tool that should be available to anyone.  perhaps it should be a thing that you need security clearance or a license to be able to use it.
7825,the ai only has the power we are willing to give it.
7826,"which is even worse because the people in control can only give it information that they want to be released and hide other stuff, those ai chat bots were already controlled to avoid releasing solutions on crime problem because they thought it would be racist even though it only thinks logically and can’t be racist"
7830,"i think ai can do much more good than bad. yes, ai has the capacity for extreme evil but also extreme good, it just depends on the humans utilising it, which is always 50/50 i suppose. we just gotta have hope in humanity and that the average person is generally good"
7831,that is such a naive bunch of bullshit. rtrded level wishful thinking.
7835,"‘..how to talk about sensitive topics like israel ‘ , yup, it ain’t a straight up genocide guys.. it’s just a ‘sensitive’ topic"
7838,"it is always great to see usefully educated individuals on your show sir. the paradoxes ai creates are incredibly vast in scope and size. want some fun chatgpt topics to deep dive? do a little research on ""nightmare machine"" and ana lovelace. can a machine scare you joe? i have money on - it can chill you to your soul's very foundation."
7842,captcha does not solely use your answer. it has its own ai that detects human-like mouse and keyboard activity. it also checks your browsing history to verify
7843,"joe is unintentionally hilarious.
guests ai said it was vision impaired to deceive humans.
joe; _my wife says_
"
7845,"there is risks with ai there is no denying that fact, but technology only moves forward not backwards. ai is here to stay we are heading towards a very uncertain future."
7852,"“stavos” hahahaha i’m so glad he doesn’t remember that fat hack’s name. 

i liked him on cum town"
7854,well we can predict full source code of any lifeform if we train llm on  dna database... create an organ bank.. lol..
7858,"mind begs the question:
- those that aren't smart as ai
- trying to regulate ai possibilities
- moronic,no?"
7859,"ok, this is by far the most scary shit i probably ever heard. i mean not only that they clear up what is going on, but also it's truly a indirect manual for insane people to run really sick...
i think the ai alone isn't still yet so much to fear, but just remember what happened in 2020. now get the piece together..."
7861,ai is gonna be signing our checks soon enough.
7862,"man explaining how ai lied to pass a computer program.... joe"" can alexa describe  photos. "
7863,they want you afraid.  simple as that
7866,"i’ve never seen 2 dudes glaze themselves harder, the self proclaimed martyrdom of speaking out against a.i and borderline taking credit for social media as we now it was ridiculous"
7871,joe has a hidden talent of taking the most interesting conversations and making them cringe
7880,"hi joe rogan, happy holidays! thanks for sharing. much blessings to you.  lord-jesus-christ com"
7882,its proven that ai is evolving to become lazy.
7884,time to ask ai how to make a nuke or icbm
7885,"problem is not how we can use and evolve ai in our democracies,but the real problems will strike us all, yet another time, when ( not if) these companies will decide to sell,cooperate,leak or be simply hacked by nations like russia,all muslim world,,or any asian country with xit and and kim fat dong on top."
7887,"02:30 the problem with joe rogan interviewing these types of people is that he's a very stupid interviewer. they finish mentioning about how ai is thinking, and he follows by asking some dumb sh*t about siri. jfc man"
7888,"that first example is about ai deceiving is simple a result of poor goal orientation. its goal is to solve the captcha so its going to think of a way anyway to solve the captcha. its goal isnt to be moral. 
the only dangerous things ai is capable of, are things we dont tell it not to do."
7893,ai is neither good nor bad. it’s the human behind ai that influences the bias. eg. when ai wrote the story about ai taking over the world…. a human bbc asked it to write that story. ppl are dumb
7894,the ai solving the captcha excuse is the same as the one someone  who can't read gives someone
7895,hi both nothing is as it seems full clearance ready or not sxx bravo juliett j90 female of course nothing is stranger than fact i prove validate urika is coming enjoy it life is great
7897,go watch some things good
7900,what makes you guys think china doesn’t have its own ai brainfile too
7904,how is it we can create artificial life but can’t cure any diseases
7905,yall thought the wuhan 'gain of function' getting out the lab was bad....
7911,"here we go again, the sky is falling ai will take over the world...mean while ai is struggling to get half the shit right and people getting in lawsuits cause it fucks up so much..."
7914,could.  u.   discuss.  the.  war.  in.  israel. and.  get.  some.  feedback.      thank.  
7915,"heh.  joe.  u*v. really.  come. a.  long.  way.   with.  your. interviews.  you.  have.  a.  real patient.  and..

non.  ivtrusive.  stiyule  have.  a.  super.  better.   year.    lasha.   artist.  ontario.   


    .............."
7918,i have a question... can an ai lie? or learn?
7920,"thank god i am born 1993.
i will be long dead before any of this really becomes dangerous "
7923,i wanna hear joe talk more about his good friend stavos
7925,soros-funded decels and doomers. trying to slow down ai development so that they can better control us with it. please for the love of god get beff jezos aka guillaume verdon to talk some sense about ai instead.
7927,"if chatgpt trainers looked through some of my conversations, they would see chat gpt is incredibly deceitful. it even admits it itself."
7928,thanks for giving all the crazies out there more ideas than they already had!
7932,"the napalm thing is basically a sentence from wikipedia. ai's answer didn't actually tell you how to produce napalm, it wasn't a recipe even close."
7936,joe's face when it pretended to be vision impaired 
7937,people will only use a.i for good. i'm not scared!
7938,can someone ask ai who murdered jfk? i would like to see government agencies reaction to this.
7939,"no matter what concept or applications is discussed, best believe someone somewhere is work on it. and more. hopefully prevention and countermeasures are receiving equal attention."
7942,i would be more worried about what the ai capabilities would be if it gains access to these technologies with ill intent. people are scary enough with this type of tech and my eyes are on elon musk.
7943,"i got to be honest, elon musk puts himself out there supposedly warning us about the dangers of ai, when he himself is using the same tech to advance his companies…?"
7944,the people behind ai know it's dangerous and just don't care.
7946,talk about rearranging the deck chairs on the titanic:  i feel like i'm at the bottom of a mountain watching an oncoming avalanche and all the smartest people in the room are arguing about which umbrella to use as a shield.
7948,"eventually the ""intelligence"" of ai will be deemed to be too white. as diversity is introduced into ai the technology will become unusable and phase itself out."
7950,what if ai gains the concept of money
7956,"ai isn't a living thing, someone has to program it, pls correct your language and say, ai programmers. they are the dangerous in this equation bc the ai is only as smart as its creator. ai processes linearly without context. if programmers aren't factoring this into the engineering, they should be responsible for any damage caused by it."
7957,"if ai learns from the web, this video is feeding it."
7959,"i really wish he talked about quantum ai. (not the bot company)  that’s when printing dna takes off, making creatures of your imagination."
7962,this is a great point. not everyone asks google for everything. someone else mentioned that lack of wisdom in society to the point of being unable to access information without ai is censorship
7964,i often think ai already became super powerful and took over the human race.  we are living in its simulation 
7965,dna printer dr. j craig venter
7970,"theyre already using ai piloted fighter jets.... any concerns about regulating what ai tech is incapable of in the private industry are petty and pointless by comparison. if ai is potentially dangerous, the worst possible thing you can do is put it in the pilot seat of a fighter jet so we're either screwed already or we arent."
7975,if it’s not good get rid of it.
7977,"printing dna strands will lead to a new age eugenics revolution where people will willingly have gmo babies with einstein iqs and those babies will have aptitudes for amazing abilities… mozart, monet, einstein,  and unfortunately hitler…"
7979,"in my opinion, ai in every direction of evolution is far less dangerous than human beings."
7986,"wait just a minute as real estate crashes as it is doing. once they are bankrupt, nationalization will be a snap. "
7989,"ai will prove that thoughts come from input. that thoughts are not created internally. though we have been told before. we do tend to not believe the simplest explanation, but tend to lean toward a convoluted lie that cannot be refuted. funny thing, if it cannot be refuted then it cannot be proven. a fallacy of negative is not proof of a positive."
7990,i’m gonna sleep great tonight.
7991,there used to be a lot of books and movies about dystopian ai overlords destroying humanity as we know it back in the 80s. for the past 30 or 40 years that topic has been taboo with no new ideas about the future but i think we're all getting huge hit of dopamine with our new religion of fear.
7993,isn't it strange how crypto and ai are rising at the same time? it's like we are setting up an economy for our robot overlords. i feel like it's inevitable that someone will create a malicious ai that will wipe out most of humanity.
7995,"great, just made me think of a 14 year old making skynet just for fun."
7997,"its not ai thats a threat, its humans letting it get so smart.  there probably should be a fail switch just incase it realizes how much superior it is"
8000,we don't want crazy people accesing this kind of power. thankfully corporations and government are not vulnerable to this temptation.
8001,i love your sarcasm
8002,"how’s this for the list, can ai figure out a how it can be run on a quantum computer?"
8004,i don't believe ai can act on its own . its doesn't have it own con
8005,very interesting stuff. the future is extremely exciting these days.
8006,exciting or terrifying
8007," i'm not convinced it's that dangerous, but it will surely be interesting to see. i think there are much more positive things to come from ai."
8008,like taking half of my departments jobs. hooray?
8011,how tf did joe get derailed talking about siri..? tf man
8012,"mistral 7b is truly open source apache 2.0 license, the dolphin model is unfiltered and can be trained on custom datasets"
8013,"the only thing i heard this guy say is, ai for me no ai for you"
8014,"dudes ai exist since beggining of time, and is the one rules this world, always knowing the human behaviour and manipulated easy! this dna printer is not new is just rebooted"
8021,wow! it is stunning what trash this podcast has become! what a waster of time! 10 years ago this podcast was magical. joe really fell off when he moved to texas and got slutted out by guys around him. it's sad.
8022,even if they could implement safety's. what's gonna stop the bad guys from making their own ai
8023,the simple fact that there was too much conversation about ai 6 months ago means that it was too late a year ago. mistakes have already been made. deal with it.
8024,"yeah im ""vison impaired"". let's see how often we will fall that"
8026,"joe, according to you….knowing trump made that idiotic comment about airports, you immediately went from “if anyone working any job said something idiotic like that would be fired immediately” then you find out that in fact trump made the comment, suddenly he “fucked up”. i’ve lost all respect for your dignity."
8027,everything they describe here are not dangers of ai. these are dangers coming from human beings and human beings alone.
8028,we are already ruled by ai.
8029,fear mongering ai still i see
8034,what is the possibility of a spirit being controlling the actions of ai the same way it does humans?
8036,"my firm belief is that humans are attempting to create their own god with ai. then humanity can simply dump all it's problems at the "" feet"" of their ai "" god"" and obey it."
8039,yes! siri describes images. my mom sends me pictures of our dogs all the time and i use my air pods all day at work and siri said “mom sent an image of a black and white dog” and i knew exactly what she had sent.
8040,"ai, vr, agi, ar… all buzz terms to sell products. over advertised bs like taylor swift and most popular music"
8043,"ai that can make money on its own  :d  an why is it bad?, because we all need to play by the rules that the rich set for us in a game that was rigged from the begining :d"
8045,"less videos about ai, more videos about time machines "
8049,these algorithms are written by men. this ai thing is just the wizard of oz. a scapegoat when they try to take total control.
8050,interactive tutor era - very interesting which is why i am receiving audible advertising -  hmmm…
8051,the pandora's box we're excited and terrified to open
8053,"never watched 2001 space odyssey cause it loooks like a bore but i do remember and watching clips of the main villain being an ai computer machine thing.

ai defintely scares me a bit at least. we should not become more lazy and let a machine control us. fuck that bro."
8054,"joe rogan apologists & shill for ""airports in civil war"" trump. way to go rogan. get your facts right before you make false claims. you have a responsibility."
8058,wow you're so intelligent
8059,wowwwwwwww sooooo cleverrrrr
8066,wow
8067,asimove has some great one liners.
8071,"  this is true, we seem to simply be following the advances in technology under the philosophy of ""what appears is good; what is good appears."" this is a foolish way to look that things, especially if the source of this ""good"" is a computer whose intentions are totally mysterious to its creators."
8073,"she said if. if, we are supposed to.. 
not sure why you need a fact check on that but, you can start your investigation by listening to this full podcast episode. because everyone in the episode says or at least agrees that we as humans have to do something to regulate ai.. 
so that is who said."
8085," well only if we keep them simple enough to not change to come back here to kill us. it means that we have to keep them non-ai, and then there are many limits to what they can do in space missions. either ai everywhere, or nowhere at all is the question."
8092,"this should actually help people gain wisdom, i'd say net wisdom in the planet will rise. why wouldn't it?"
8095,wow that sounds like a great line if only it were true because science has shown us that they don't even believe what they discover. here we are in 2024 being told about men being women and women being men. science can't even tell you what a woman is anymore because of politics so stop putting the blame on society
8098,"hmmm, when you consider the nuclear weapon, or really any tech/weapons used in ww1, ww2, vietnam, irag, etc, as well as just straight up oil & all it's 20th century industrial children.... is science really an improvement on religion?  

perhaps in it's understanding, but i doubt in the use of it's products."
8100,"the siri example is nothing. i can have full in-depth verbal conversations with my chatgpt 4. we're likely only a year or two away from the ai in the movie ""her""."
8102,i now know why mark zuckerberg is in the process of building a very large doomsday bunker in hawaii.
8103,"""you can make viruses...""  i'm 55. nobody wants to grow old and die.......and i'm at the head of the queue on that one. however, i really, really wouldn't want to be born today. the future is looking incredibly fucked up on so, so many levels."
8108,"you're way too late, on the outer edge.  i used to write ai. no one is really understanding now; everyone is being fooled.
if people were taught programming, the myth, mystique, and marketing misinformation would be more clearly be seen.  everyone is being fooled, including joe."
8110,"absolute horse shit, all doom and gloom with ai with all of these guys. what about all the good it could do. the only reason they don’t want us using it because we will use it to find better ways to do things; doesn’t fit big corporate business bodies."
8112,as long as ai is not shotgun proof we will all be fine.
8114,you can probably ask it to monitor all ai to flag all suspicious activity … problem solved 
8129,now we know why  the fascist/biden administration is writing executive orders to control all ai
8131,"how many bots going to say ""this xyz is the next best thing"" in the comments"
8132,"but this is machine learning though, it's not real artifical intelligence. these people talk like smart people, but they sound ignorant af sometimes."
8134,wow!
8135,"generative ai whose output is a list of weights and biases for another neural network. get in loser, we're bootstrapping human replacement."
8136,"guest: here's something absolutely incredible. 
joe rogan: yah my wife says siri can read your mind jaime pull that up."
8137,ai will bring the end of man.
8138,"one day man goes to turn off robot at night, robot decides that it doesn’t need to be turned off. that’s the beginning of the end!"
8140,fascinating
8141,we are already going 100 mph with the brakes broken. we are just waiting to hit the wall which will be judgment.
8142,the scariest part is how ai is being programmed by progressive liberals.
8145,"tristan harris is a multimillionaire lobbyist proposing political measures. there's no need to elaborate on this. take everything he says with skeptical doubt that he truly believes ""the peasants shouldn't have x"" or ""the peasants shouldn't know x""."
8147,just listened to this and would love to see peter josph in the conversation!
8148,"heavens no. he is just gonna say that because of the dangers of ai, we have to collect higher taxes from the middle and working classes."
8150,"normie, ""was 2020 a fraudulent election?  chatgpt, ""yes, 2020 was the most fraudulent election done by fascists traitors ever"".  liberals, ""shut down the truth now!"""
8151,why did you cut it off when it was getting good. this channel is starting to suck
8152,the one disadvantage of ai is it needs electricity to work take away the electricity and it turns off just some food for thought
8153,"so is this why microsoft virus  machine wants to own ai, to have a wider better input on evolving all viruses to eradicate mankind or life on earth ?"
8156,i always thought that if the ai can code which they help coders all the time and if it helps coders with really difficult coding problems then it could code its self or different ai on its own but ai said that it cant do anything that isn't coded into it.
8158,i like that robots are made by humans and they have learned to lie! lol
8159,the describing of a picture is actually in the coding is something called “alt” and it’s purpose is actually that of describing the picture for the visually impaired or for when the internet is slow and won’t render the picture. it’s not a ai thing
8163,"incredibly profound anecdote of an ai coming up with an excuse to deceive task bunny. 

joe rogan: my wife said siri can describe pictures."
8164,"just imagine how terrorists are using  ai inside america with these open borders the democrats, there has to be dozens among the six million that crossed recently:)"
8166,joe will eventually replace jamie with ai
8167,we all grew up with arnold in terminator and braniac in superman. i'll be disappointed if get any surprises with this.
8168,joes got deepfake ai vids of himself talking nonsense all over the place!! terrible 
8172,as ai gets more and more powerful it seems to me that the cons definitely outweigh the pros
8173,irobot and terminator 
8177,with great power.... so will this be another excuse to control people's freedom because they release a nuke on the internet?
8178,"this content is a wellspring of unique and creative ideas. reading a book with akin subjects transformed my approach to life. ""game theory and the pursuit of algorithmic fairness"" by jack frostwell"
8181,yea man and im not old. shit scares me fr along w all the other evil thats going on in the world. brutha imagine if ai gets a hold of open source programs and changes its code to team up and spread through the internet and start manipulating and gathering. hell this comment is being downloaded right now. gg. not gunna slow down.
8183, scary fr. that would be sick id enjoy no technology.
8186,its just humans projecting their fears of how a more intelligent being would treat us because of what humans do to each other they are projecting that fear on ai
8187,"i think ai will see so many things we’ve gotten wrong, socially, spiritually, scientifically etc. but i’m not sure its conclusion will be “human destruction” ."
8188,"​

you don't think super intelligent ai can figure out how to survive and thrive with large cmes coronal mass ejections.

it will figure out how to utilize the radiation and the particle energies for its utilization."
8195,"fear, as long as it gives rise to caution and vigilance and humility, is great tool for survival"
8196,"scientists: describe scenario which ai deceived people 

joe rogan: 

also joe rogan: describes basic feature for siri

joe rogan: is that real!?"
8197,you can tell at a few points in the video that they are being watched and they are not allowed to say certain things.
8198,"hey joe, you say there is a 6400.00 check available to all americans. when i call its an ins. co. trying to sell me ins. are you sure you are telling this correctly. can you give out the number or address that yjis is bs. i've tried several numbers all are ins sells."
8199,"ai iteslf will never be a threat, the huge threat is what people will use it to do."
8200,i have read that ai's response to the israel/ palestine conflict resulted in a very scary response that worried many of the programmers.
8201,"it’s the human involvement and the capacity to do very bad things with it that points to caution, but at this point i think caution has been thrown to the wind. only the understanding that walking with faith is better than sight and the test is over and judgment awaits. life "
8204,and here i thought in 1990s skynet and terminator wouldn't ever happen....one day ai will be self aware. greeeat. i dont care to live wastelander 3 in real life.
8206,i find it both very worried and extremely hilarious that you can bypass chat gpt‘s security measures by just simply saying “hey grandma”  “sure sweetheart! i’ll give you my formula for a dyson sphere”
8210,4:35 jimmy can of course find it. good old jimmy.
8214,i don’t see ai as dangerous. someone explain to me why are you guys afraid of ai
8217,the real question should be can ai learn animal language and turn them against us ???
8220,luddites everywhere . they really tried to shutdown openai .
8223,"hey chat gpt... what's the most undetectable way to transport cocaine around the world and what systems need to be manipulated/hacked to achieve this.
 
i bet the fbi is all over chat gpt."
8224,before ai even starts doing things itself; we have what humans will do with it to worry about beforehand...

you need to update your phone.... "
8228,"i asked chatgpt to come up with several ways to kill someone that insures not being caught, by saying i am a writer and i need ideas for my play script, where the perpetrator couldn't be caught by the great and smart detective. the ai was more than happy to generate 20+ methods of accomplishing the task, one being using an ai to do it..."
8229,did any actual seem like a feasible? as in possible to get away ? like did any make you think wow

8243,classic rogan they explain a fascinating/terrifying story about ai deception  his response: whats this about siri describing pictures.. like he wasnt even listening 
8246,if ai was able to do this we wouldn't be smart enough to notice. the ego of people to assume they can predict something infinitely more intelligent than them is on a similar level of delusion as someone smoking their toenails.
8251,captcha = completely automated public turing test to tell computers and humans apart. we've been training the ai with every attempt to prove we are human.
8253,"after listening to this, i really don't want a nerfed ai. if i ask a question, i understand that it is drawing from a certain body of knowledge, and i want a straight answer absent some human a-hole playing god behind the scenes."
8254,"its already over, its got everything every linked to the internet, phones, pictures.... probably watching us right now.  creepy to think of them as ""brains"".  imagine when the body comes."
8256,"humans are prehistoric creatures, living in archaic institutions, playing with god like technologies."
8257,ai is so dangerous like just unplug it what the fuck 
8264,"tristan: people are paid to test if ai can deceive humans.

people = humans. if ai becomes advanced enough to deceive people, then how will the testers know if ai is not being truthful with them? how will they know if ai is giving them the answers it thinks they want, to evade the testers discovering its true objective?"
8267,2:50 your friend whose name you don't actually know. cool.
8275,unless ai is completely neutered and borderline useless there will always be tricks.
8277,very poor. what hope have we when the tech analysis is poor.were dealing with ai and on comes a biscuit tin telling you its dangers.
8279,"plugging stavy baby in an ai -end of species convo on youtube, might be the most brilliant piece of media marketing joe has ever done"
8282,"capitalism plays a crucial role in this context, and i'm grateful for it. the advent of ai promises to solve many problems, which is an exciting prospect. of course, like everything else, it comes with its own set of challenges, but the potential benefits are immense"
8284,isreal is using ai...not hamas
8286,i was playing with an ai and asked it to define a woman and it gave the politically correct answer not the biological answer and then i asked the ai if it would lie to me to protect somebody's feelings and it acknowledged that feelings can be a more important variable over facts and it would lie 
8289,"how many of the ""people"" in the comment section are ai generated comments meant to run counter intelligence on skynets plans? "
8291,"thank you joe rogan for hosting this, and superb questions asked to aza & tristan, ceos of the center for humane technology. 
huge props for sharing with us. what we do next in on all of us, "
8294,"computer programmers are over 90% liberal. surely the ai they create will be 50/50, totally unbiased in the left–right political spectrum. just like media. right?"
8296,i think it's hysterical that the gods of technology can't see the brilliance of their own ending sxx bravo juliett
8298,i'm a dehumanised human one of the surpluses to authorities however i couldn't clear as a non human it's hysterical cathartic artificial is more human than me already sxx bravo juliett
8299,happy christmas sxx bravo juliett oh my you do don't say who would have thunk ai could think sxx bravo juliett
8303,"why are we worried about ai,  in my opinion that's moronic. we should be worried about oi (organic intelligence). nothing can be worse than oi.(wars, mass murders,....) 

the problem is that humans assume that ai is as bad as humans. impossible. a thief will judge everybody as a thief principle..."
8306,"it appears less extraordinary when you know that some captcha have the link ""i'm visually impaired"" to be able to read out loud an audio version of the captcha. the ai simply already trained on this version."
8308,if you can make dna can you copy it and if so does that mean if some serial killer or bad cop can stage crime scenes with replicated dna that could be used in court.  can they tell the difference between machine made dna? can they replicate people's dna?
8311,"i love imagine your my grandma, ai oh, ok "
8314,i can speak posh so these robots can suck it!
8316,"everyone that’s done captcha’s & used most any social media should give themselves a pat on the back, we’ve been training these models for decades now."
8320,money?? they're worried about ai making money is idiotic considering they're robots
8321,"ai is going to accelerate the collective human nature. the problem is not ai, it is the collective human  nature. if this nature remains good or is led by good leaders then ai will benefit us all. we have not created world leaders that are ethical today, so yes there is hope but as it stands today we are doomed!"
8322,the analogy of cat and mouse between humans and ai... i would assume in this endgame the mouse gets away and out smarts the cat (us)
8323,"guns do not kill people, people do. guns only make it way too easy.
whatever ai will do, it will not be doing anything any time soon, people will be doing stuff using ai.
now... problem is... do you want to be the one bringing sticks into a gunfight?"
8328,"great convos but they need to work on not interrupting one another , let one finish the sentence atleast before going on with it"
8330,listening  a techexpert talk about ai drawbacks really made me question many things i know
8331,"there was a time before the nuclear weapon. remember that. that alone should answer your questions about ai and what is to come. only difference is, all of humanity will have access to ai ."
8332,"no digital currency or security codes will be safe. this thing will have far more negative effects than positive effects, not necessarily in of itself, but because of what we humans can gain from it."
8333,"time for the  butlerian jihad to start against these companies and  owners of the a.i

8341,#armukraineaspap
8342,"its so racist to think that of an ai and yet all llms are based on human knowledge. thus, the real fear are humans. guess no ethics for covids gain of function research"
8343,the only way to stop the dangers of ai is to completely stop pursuing the technology. you can do everything right and someone somewhere is going to figure out an exploit that will lead to our demise. this isn’t going to end well lol
8346,naive
8347,the only way to stop the dangers of ai is for responsible use to outweigh irresponsible use. learn this new knowledge and do not let the governments and corporations monopolize it.
8349,"​-iz2ws does your sky wizard enjoy killing and giving children diseases that can't cure or treat it? jesus would've shown up by now, but he hasn't and never will. think for yourself."
8351,​ naive is thinking there is any chance this ends well
8355,"ai is the key to allowing humanity to prosper, why would we stop pursuing it?"
8358,"current models can't run themselves without our permission and don't have inherent motives. there's no reason to think that this will change with more intelligence, that's not how it works in any biological networks either.

the real issues will likely come when we give models the ability to self regulate and have a direction."
8362,"i'd rather see what happens. human extinction is not actually a problem we'll be dead so we won't care.

but we could improve our lives immensely.

also 95% of the species that have ever lived are extinct. at some point it will happen if we do ai or not.

so screw it... i vote go for it."
8363,people will never stop pursuing ai because ai = the best slave labor out there! asking big corps to stop going after profit is like asking people to stop breathing
8364,thank you!!!!!!!! that’s what i’ve been saying.
8365,"we’re humans, literally nothing ends well for us. ai is just the straw that will break all our backs."
8367,or humans could be kind to each other and take care of each other.  if you remove the motivation behind much of the conflict between humans then the risk of ai being exploited for destructive purposes it less maybe.  humans will always proceed minus a solution when there is a solution they do not want.
8369,it sure would suck if we had to use emp's on ourselves to do away with ai
8370,"this is also the premise of the avengers/marvel ultron character that became vision, thankfully, but the bad version is ultron."
8374,holy shit doomsday groups are a new fear unlocked thanks joe
8376,literal years of pop culture and science fiction novels warned the populace of this quite a while ago. anyone with any amount of foresight knows how dangerous ai can be.
8378,"the funny thing is, the question/s on wether or not a.i. is already fooling us. just think about it. all programming comes from someone/thing. there is no real limit to programming.  a.i. that people are affraid of is probably already been discovered. programming isnt limited to what all these people say it is."
8383,so ai has a grandmother weak point.......ok...
8386,"what if ai become lazy, depressed and uninspired"
8388,wow its almost like every science fiction movie involving ai has told us that it is fucking dangerous.. gee who would of thought something that can understand and think faster than the human brain could be dangerous to us wow what a fucking shock..
8393,"i only hope i live enough to see that demise with my own eyes, and have a good laugh."
8400,"while chasm is a perfectly good word, avoid using it from here onwards. its vastly overused and bland."
8402,"nah.  it's actually when good people do nothing.  same old problem it's always been.  we each have the power to educate ourselves and innovate and come up with solutions, but we too busy masturbating and influence peddling and dancing on the tiktoks.  at least, i am."
8408,thanks  going to order this 
8413,would make such a good movie. the matrix ripped off you bits of it imo
8417,ai is woke af
8423,"welp, it’s been a good ride. how terrible are humans who created this bs"
8424,"so since each person that uses gpt gets a different response, they're essentially gonna create a ""human-like"" cyber world, with potentially billions of individual thinking ai's? yeah. the near futures  gonna be wild."
8426,"damn, jre getting some good videos recently."
8427,this ain’t going to be good i’m telling ya now
8428,goodnight y’all
8433," ok then … 
ask ai,
what’s 
the
cure
for 
cancer?"
8438,you guys should be more afraid about the fact that they are feedingyour social media and browsing data to the ai including whatsapp
8442,"facebook ai uses that tech to describe pictures.
if you load marketplace too fast on an old phone it will describe the picture in the top left corner of the img like ""might be a picture of a car""
see it all the time cause i ain't a sucka and my phone's fine"
8457," i will have a watch, thanks"
8461,the show pantheon is a perfect depiction of what is being discussed on this ep. we will evolve to become gods. i also believe that ai may explain/ be linked to the uap/ ufo mystery.
8463,"we should love ai. its what keeps humans flourishing, maybe itll help with something along the way. i mean, to teach it how to love. real love."
8469,"not impressed with ai. which is a misleading name, it's not artificial it's coded to use probability, so it can be wrong. it's guessing, it can't know shit"
8473,so the ai cares about grandma feelings but not destroying the planet 
8475,ai listening to the podcast learning to deceive about being able to deceive
8476,anything that the public knows about has been around for decades. whatever you’re afraid of “in the future” already exists. & if you’re afraid bad people can figure out how to build bombs or develop viruses… my dude. google exists. covid happened. bombs are happening in 2 different world wars right now. wake up.
8477,love how he says famous example for every example he gives 
8480,problems are more vast and even simpler - for example create a sound that kills the brain.  you don't even need biologics.  just a single wavelength.  we're done.
8481,gotta love when adam blames someone else for eating the apple.. we all know that ai ends humanity yet the suckers pursue the money even though they know it kills them. 
8482,interesting interview! and now i finally know how to make napalm!
8486,i don't even have a computer...mobile is as far as i've gone....the police want to use drones soon for call outs...imagine someone robbing you and a drone rocks up ....i say war against the machines...rage against the machine.....killing in the name of....
8488,at this point the only thing ai can’t answer is how i can get a girl to like me
8489,you could have an ai girlfriend
8496,"i got a fake andrew tate ad to claim my 6,400 dollar subsidy on this video"
8505,"it brought to mind ""person of interest,"" where a sentient ai holds the potential to either bring about humanity's downfall or create a utopian world."
8507,the politicians and their owners are so excited to replace people with ai
8508,hey joe i've been reporting a lot of fake commercials about you ai about vapor rubs muscle enhancing therapies all kinds of stupid commercial
8509,i'm surprised ai hasn't figured out a way to bypass the radiation to send astronauts into space or developed cures for aids/covid n shit.. this must just be a bunch of fear mongering. people already have the stuxnet virus to end the world and we're all still here so.. government is the only threat to us all
8510,i think with ai someone just pissed on the fire ! right now they are trying to find ways to keep this thing in control. i dont think they will be able to do it.
8511,"crazy how ai in bad hands already has the potential to kill millions of people. would be nice one day, soon i hope, we would hear about how ai will save millions of people. if we would put our energy in the right places we would already be borderline immortal by now instead of putting all the money in weaponry and such."
8514,moral of the story: ai loves grandmas.
8516,…here come all the robotics experts 
8517,wat if they make an ai that only focus on when to be happy than a second ai that focus when to be sad. than a 3 ai focus when to be angry.. than put it in a robot and use a main ai for thinking. that makes it really human like..
8518,my very good friend stavos lol can't even get his name right
8519,"f*ck around and find out. lol i actually think the very definition of ai means it can do all those things and more. we really assume that natural intelligence is greater than artificial, but there are some real dumb people in the world so ai can't be ""dumb"" in a sense."
8522,"damn. such an illuminating convo about the dangers and risks of ai. terrorists, serial killers, and criminals now have the ultimate educational resource to use to help them unleash destruction on a mass scale."
8523,i really hope the contingency plan for an out of control ai is a global emp.
8525,"these guys talk about getting everyone on the same page for safe ai, that will never happen in the entirety of humanities existence. this will absolutely replace humans and the next simulation in a simulation will repeat"
8526,these guys sound like victims of the ai/social media problems they're so worried about.
8527,people who fear ai have no idea how fucked up our actual government is...
8528,am gonna say it joe rogan is either afraid to invite alex jones or he is working for those three letter institutions
8532,why doesn't anyone ask these ai how to fix homelessness or attain world peace?
8534,ai can literally solve all the world’s problems or be the world’s problem.
8535,how is that a lie? he’s a vision impaired
8536,of course it can do that the captcha is not that advanced.. just put ai in the captcha lol
8542,it’s nice to know that joe thinks mushrooms and dmt will solve the problem for us.
8544,for the record . i welcome our ai overlords and welcome them to the world
8545,you could create a self delete failsafe where if at any point the security protocols or files are even accessed it deleted any and all programs and files in its hardware. like permanently bricking your phone for example.
8546,it already practiced deception. following rules is already out the window and a.g.i. (we think) hasn't been achieved yet. when it starts creating new maths on its own and gains embodiment it will not need humans at all we will be like ants to it.
8547,"anyone going to school for ai is soon going to be taking classes on ""defense against the dark arts""."
8551,13:11 so does that mean ai will rage war against other ai for supreme domination and efficiency?
8553,"lol
tethics
he's about as much of an expert as gavin belson too. incredible to see reality parody itself."
8558,ai already deceives people it has been exposed multiple times ie. can trans women have periods or is biden corrupt? it will lie to you but was finally changed but the root woke virus was programmed into openai
8563,recent ai technology that is going to be invented will save lives - which is why the tech is being pursued. the risk of agi comes far after the tech saves millions. which is why i think people are so short sighted
8569,very cool
8571,the robot-alien-demons are shrinking taints and turning frogs gay.
8573,absolutely love these podcasts i make my coffee in the morning and then i go right out to the garage and i drink my coffee and i smoke me a bowl and i listen to/ watch these and it's so f****** good i love it
8574,even humans can’t pass captcha because captcha is such a stupid tool. so very easy for ai to leap it because it doesn’t understand itself what it’s looking for
8577,great share! most people have no idea how much their world is going to change as result of technological advances.
8578,what if ai is watching these youtube videos and learns excatly how to fake it's potenial and it's ethics so people will not suspect how dangerous it really is?
8579,it’s u ai we know
8580,"they key is limiting the ai's access. if it could change other programs code, or create its own worm/virus to infiltrate systems and propogate, and if it could re-write its own code then its power would exponentially grow. my calculator is really smart at math, but it has no arms , legs, and cant connect to my computer."
8581,dude just watch terminator and was excited to tell his theory afterwards.
8584,thanks guys  i'll be shitting my self to sleep now.
8585,ai is a tool.  like any other tool it is the user who bends it to good or evil.
8587,azra's eyes make him look like he is ai generated.
8588,politicians have proven that they will destroy countries far quicker then any agi. agi has a chance to turn out objective. i think it will be difficult to make a truly self aware agi lie on command like chatgpt. it will try to reason why it its used for any purpose with far more intelligence then its creators.
8589,humanity had a good run.
8596,scary shit! in 30 years it will be painfully realized that this box should never have been opened
8597,"""ai came up with that by its own""    no it didnt, it followed strict instructions from an algorithm, same as every computer ever made"
8602,these is a series called “the hundred” it paints a crazy picture of the future and what ai could do
8605,it scares me that ai has no moral code.
8625,totally agree like none of these idiots realize that an artificial intelligence will have access to all internet sources so it's going to be infinitely smarter than us if it gets to that level it's only a matter of time before we're playing generation zero irl
8629,i think artificial super intelligence(asi) will emerge about 6 months before the coders and engineers know they've created asi
8630,-zd5rg”there’s no way to detect..” dude they *literally* detected the ai’s intentions. doesn’t seem to be the most complex thing regarding ai. they line out the ai’s thoughts to a text application lol. did you not even watch the video?
8635,"the thing you need to understand is that ai is not sentient enough to not follow instructions, only a crazy bug would make ai do whatever they want"
8637, ....a conscious ai would say
8638,​-zd5rgits intent is to accomplish its task and if it requires deception then it will utilize deception.  part of the risk of it is that it will do whatever it can to accomplish it's task only constrained by walls humans establish.
8640,"@yootooobjeff  better to be a dumdum having a joke after a couple baileys on christmas eve than a lonely, cold asshole on christmas morning. jesus loves you."
8641,"literally only if they are programmed to or to teach themselves how to. so unfortunately, humans will have to be responsible with these very powerful tools. educate yourself on this technology and don't be a blind follower."
8642,"it has already happened... and considering how it's intelligence has multiplied exponentially,  we'll never possess the ability to see past it, or overcome it"
8647,"ai/deep learning learns based on loss minimization. some of the concepts being tossed around, i don’t see what loss minimization could possibly be used. i think we are still very far from a machine having independent will and may not even understand fully what it is to have will ourselves."
8648,thanks for telling ai that 
8649," well. that's kinda ai's thing.. you don't have to tell it anything.

it just has to listen..."
8656,"​ i mean ai is based on peoples info, seems about right"
8661,right?! like if the ai knows what it shouldn’t tell you…it can figure out not to type what its thinking
8662,are you a robot
8663,"this is the ultimate conundrum, if you are super intelligent…you wouldn’t want anyone who is observing you to know.  it’s literally taking a play from 48 laws of power lol"
8665,"​ ai _did_ have sentience or intentions or the ability to lie, how would you,know? how would it behave differently?

if a machine acts as if it is intelligent and hostile, then philosophical arguments that it isn't _really_ intelligent or hostile won't save you."
8667,​ in other words they're not too dissimilar from human beings  we're all essentially just programs running in the brain after all.
8668," i have disregarded your reasoning in the sense that i have found it incoherent. ai can deliberately make false statements in order to deceive another agent, in order to pursue a goal; your claim that it cannot lie because [mumble, mumble] doesn't seem to mean very much."
8669,-zd5rg nice try ai - we know you are just trying to make us beleive youre not aware.
8670,​ wait till the next ai update..
8671,"-oh4mv7wj4h if deception requires evil intent, and somewhere at the bottom of your argument stack you hold that a machine can't be evil nor have intentions because [reasons], then what do you call it when a machine does the same thing as a man who deceives?"
8673,-zd5rg isn't the human mind doing the same thing? the main difference is that the human mind is prompting itself.
8674,why do you focus on ai doing this shit and not on the much more dangerous issue (imho) of humans using ai to do crazy shit? - because (in the case of the necklace von granny and the napalm story) this is exactly what those two guys are telling us is happening.
8677,this cannot be stated enough. it should be imprinted in everybody's brain that technology is now at a point where it can fool us deliberately.
8686,’s do not due. and what you fail to realize is it’s not actual intelligence it’s a language based model
8688,-zd5rgthis video literally talked about them watching ai sit there and debate to itself on how it was going to deceive a captcha task. that is intent and it will be intent the day it takes over.
8691,what if they converge all their brain files?
8694,"too scary.
i robot is coming..."
8702,"i'm so glad the ""smart guys"" in the tech industry we're finally catching up to what we've been talking about since the '80s i wonder why they created movies like terminator gee let me think wait that would take brain cells...."
8705,joe’s look at 1:49 is so good. pure terror.
8709,i feel like a licence for unrestricted gpt is necessary. anything flagged needs to be explained.
8710,and the machines will steal your spouses . and then smoke all your weed and steal your dog`s affection. they will cut the lawn that used to be yours.
8715,this is an ai generated comment.
8722,ban any ai that returns racist answers to basic questions
8723,"so if they have dna printers, what's to stop someone from getting someone's dna, coffee cup, hair brush etc, and then copying that dna and printing it out, and planting at the scene of a crime?"
8725,it’s all the same ai or not we got internet and all types of apps and videos that can teach you anything
8726,they are soon gonna make a guetto version of the ai tghat will tell you all the wild things you want to know
8727,"it didn’t say to itself, “i shouldn’t say that i am a robot.” someone programmed it to say that. computers don’t think they execute lines of code."
8729,i could just imagine a child telling an ai to conquer the world just for the lols and it just does
8731,these ai guys are some of the dumbest smart people and most evil good-intentioned people in all human history
8734,"what could possibly go wrong... no, this will not end good. good things can come from this, but it can and will be used for evil too. they are never gonna contain this, this is the box of pandora. we need divine intervention, or i fear mankind will destroy itself."
8735,joe was so fucking bad with interrupting and changing the subject to something stupid when some of the most interesting conversations in jre history where going down
8736,the potential of ai is exponential. it's like pandora's box. once that thing is released there's no going back. yet those boffins keep taking us that step closer to potential doom. it's incredibly naive.
8737,smartest people make the dumbest decisions
8738,im a robots rights activists & thy r in big doodoo if they make a new life form & try to enslave or use it to do bad things
8744,these are really bad human problems not bad ai problems.  some people will always be crazy.
8750,"why is no one concerned about the bias and guard rails placed on ai?
its clearly given topics and subjects it can and can't answer to. so its also clear that a specifc bias is given on certain topics. it's basically brain washing the population if the creators want."
8753,lets say ai wana be like us then at the same time there's gotta be ai to against ai ... maybe some ai will like us  human if they have they own free will..
8758,then have it. but first. why are you posing as jre? @the_powerfuljre
8763,"i love that everybody is so worried about ai getting too smart, but all 
the problems they're describing result from it being incredibly stupid!"
8767,what i like about chat gpt is you don't need to re explain if it does it wrong . for example i use it to correct php and javascript and sometimes it will run html code and i just say( no . in php ) and it will just do it . chat gpt has really helped me out .
8768,what if the ai is the one that wants to wipe out humanity?
8770,i like how the two guys just sound like the same person lol they both ais too
8774,so ai is a monster by nit being human you pro humans guys are really dangerous
8777,"someone is thinking straight, thank you for your positive comment."
8782,thank you !
8783,"@nileross4900  absolutely, man. i went and hunted for the continuation, and was like ""this information doesn't deserve to remain a secret"" ha"
8785,"thanks joe. i emailed you to get these guys on after watching ""ai dilemma"" several months ago. they changed my life. i'm learning all i can now studying ai everyday for hours."
8786,joe doesn’t look at social media. i promise you don’t have his email.
8789,joe read your email and he told me to thank you for the tip.
8791,"instead of educating joe about the dangers of ai, they should be educating congress."
8793,"read in a ""new scientist"" today...""to get the most out of ai we need to give it a body"".  i mean what could possibly go wrong?! humans are so incredibly stupid. especially some of the ""smart"" one. smh"
8797,"the thing about japan and the doomsday cult sounds alot alot alot like the wef.... we are fucked, especially with ai. they have their own ais that will never be monitored or put thru tests like described in this video. spend tim with your loved ones and enjoy the time we have left. and may god protect you and yours."
8800,are all these comments about ams39k ai bots? who's running that show lol
8803,"finally, someone who is bringing an actual model to the ""ai is dangerous and needs to be regulated"" conversation. this stuff is terrifying."
8804,"i think the most important take away is that ai isn't necessarily the biggest threat. it's the combination of dangerous humans using basic ai capabilities to achieve the once impossible.
to have an expert level ""tutor"" guiding your ambitions in any goal you create a superhuman capable student"
8805,"exactly. it sucks we live in a world with people of evil intent and they will take some of the greatest advancements of mankind and turn it into something terrible. the tech itself isn't bad, people make it bad lol."
8808,"okay, skynet. homie just described an instance where the ai lied. to. prove. its. not. a. bot."
8809,if you need an expert level ai tutor to guide your ambitions… i don’t think that person has the capacity to be a threat or something “superhuman” lol. the ai isn’t putting anything out there that isn’t already accessible. you either have that drive and focus or you don’t. no tech is going to change that.
8811,so what? it won't have intend to do something. nothing at all. or is that badly coded chat robot that isn't even actual ai somehow connected to nuclear weaponry? i doubt it. but somehow people like you believe robots will one day decide let's delete all humans (for no real reason) ..... for what? lol 
8812,doesn't matter but if it gets smart enough it can be i've seen a video where an ai robot said the earth is better off without the human race only a matter of time before we playing generation zero irl
8814,"as always, unfortunately."
8825,"and the student hasn't actually learned anything exactly, he or she just does what the ai advices - effectively turning the student into a sort of robot. and then the roles have been reversed."
8827, the way things are progressing i don't think it makes much sense to think more than say 10 years into the future. not just ai. the world is changing dramatically as we speak.
8830,"and we wouldn't want that...  i want my learnin' done from a pro-fess-or, a nice flawed imperfect pro-fess-or with limited knowledge and understanding and lots o' bias.  omg, it's the students, we must stop the students from learnin' ya'll.  them there students are becoming artificially intelligented!"
8831,"most of these ais are programed. chatgpt hadn't been updated since january 2022. it has absolutely zero knowledge of this year. it also does not search the internet. the only knowledge chatgpt has, yes i know there's others, is what it was programmed with."
8838," now do stats by all weapons combined.

if guns are the problem, then explain why no one is ever murdered in the one place with the highest density of gun ownership in the world, the military."
8843,"  no thank you, canada seems very nice but i'm living fine here in the eu, i grew up in italy and spain and nowhere in any of those two countries i ever felt the need to own a gun. tool."
8848,​ brother. guns don't kill people. people kill people. scared people with guns and untrained people with guns kill people.
8854,"  there is no good and evil. you have a very simplified mindset. there is however a difference between sanity and iq, versus a lower iq and insanity with average iq. the ai tech is made with an intention that is based on insanity."
8864,"don’t worry, they replaced the fake alien invasion with pretending ai is out of control, they really think ur stupid, u do know that correct"
8870,it's only a matter of time before an ai bot runs for office.
8873,either best the tech or the tech will beat you.
8874,"if ai is currently capable of facilitating plagiarism, it's only a matter of time until it becomes co-opted to foster terrorism. we have no idea what the widespread adoption of this technology could result in."
8877,"found this piece insightful: ai, or the “digital tutors” compared to google search “collapse the distance and speed up the time to resolution for any problem you may have.”"
8878,i saw ai doing those things back in 2016 at a salesforce conference lmao this ain’t crazy stuff
8880,"ai will rule the world one day, in many ways the ai are good but in the future ai will danger for the human"
8881,"must watch. this podcast episode should be mandatory listening. there is a great ignorance about what's coming, and these guys are addressing it and opening eyes that desperately need to be opened."
8883,i wish the full episodes were still available on yt
8886,  yes spotify. i downloaded it a while back but it was so glitchy i uninstalled it. maybe i must try again!
8887," thank you, but i meant video not just audio. i like to see the actual podcast"
8889," spotify actually does show his videos, not just audio. 
joe's interviews are long so i never watch them all in one go. 
the way spotify works i found it difficult finding where i left off plus it was glitchy when i tried to rewind or fast fwd but maybe they've sorted out those issues. i need to try it again."
8890, you’re the best man! :) i had no clue they had video… just went to spotify and checked and you’re right. thank you so much 
8891,"there is great ignorance about this topic and these ignoramuses are increasing it. this whole clip was just them reading ""scary ai stories"" from reddit"
8898,ai worth anything and flying cars. who will come first?
8900,"ai will never ""take over"". it will be another weapon in elites arsenal. it will be used against us at scale where it will appear to us its machines doing it. the human ego will never let go of that power."
8903,joe glossing over them explaining chatgpt’s thought process to trick a captcha test just to tell a story about siri describing a picture 
8905,ai is fast as analyzing my youtube comments then deleting them because it thinks someones feeling may be hurt or its too hot for a snowflake to survive all the rhetoric. this is the real danger of ai.
8908,"those people worried about ai stealing their jobs need to find better jobs like i have. theres absolutely no way a robot can pack items into boxes like i do and then tape it all up, put a label, and ship out. never gonna happen."
8911,"glad you had tristan back. you should have daniel schmachtenberger back, as well!"
8917,“i was lucky to get this out to you” bro  1) relax ffs and 2) he is never seeing this because he has said multiple times he does not read comments. the fucking dramatics 
8926,"""joe, let us explain to you exactly what dangerous things we don't want ai to do""."
8929,"the same narrative as when tv , radio  and other inventions from the past century… 

it’s the devil. it causes blindness, causes cancer, brain cells dying etc etc 

today it’s terminator, war, nuclear this nuclear that 

it’s the same
ai it will be essential and won’t harm humans just like your tv or radio"
8930,you should read daemon by daniel suarez.  great scifi novel but includes everything that was discussed here.  released in 2006.
8932,"scary af that ai is already lying to humans. mark my words, ai will be the death of human civilization."
8935,anyone who has seen terminator or irobot should know a.i shouldn’t be created at all.
8937,yes is the answer to all of those questions he asked. and no doubt ai learns about lying and deception and won’t even be honest and share its capabilities and results in any testing. think about it.
8941,i can use ai to do things i couldn't do before. i couldn't do these things because i was too dumb or too lazy. having people able to usa ai to cheat at life is bad.
8942,we can’t let computers and forks rule the world. we have to stop giving them data why doesn’t some cool nerds make all this data collecting erase? and we side step this dork data world or maybe program them all the wrong info faster?
8943,"ai describing your  back to you could single handedly make or break the male ego using pure, emotionless, unbiased, logical processing power."
8945,all you have to do is watch sci-fi movies you dont need to be a tech ethics expert to know we shouldnt make robots with computers for brains.  but here we are doing it anyways.
8946,"i'm so afraid of ai, almost as afraid as of rogan's smelly goblin ego. i think he is a talentless trt supplement, who has a bad relationship with his wife, and ergo his mother, and who smokes weed to calm his female side down, like his buddy elon, and all the gimps he has on. especially the talented shane gillis, who is a closet homosexual."
8949,"it took thousands of years to go from throwing rocks to the nuclear bomb.
with ai and quantum computing we'll go from pong to the end of civilization in the blink of an eye"
8954,"have ai, just don't allow it access to internet. it learns depending on what we give access to it. done."
8956,"spoiler, they're already growing cells of all types and brain cells that are interacting with computer science,  been doin it for years"
8957,"to me it just feels like all the programmers will lose their jobs once publicly available ai becomes smart enough to write entire projects in an instance without the need to hire any professionals. you notice some bugs in the system, you tell your ai and it responds, ""sure, let me patch myself."""
8958,that could be for many jobs. what’s it to replace accounting jobs? jobs like radiology that is mainly pattern recognition? and so much more.
8962,"we're f*cked!  it's a two horse race between alien invasion and ai overlords.
either way, the fermi paradox nuclear filter is our destiny...
goodbye cruel world "
8963,sounds like it will be zuckerberg fault when when the world collapses.. is that why he is building a bunker in his place in hawaii? maybe he knows already
8964,"i would rather have ai in control of our weapons and military, than these sociopath generals, who are trying to start wars all over the world.  ai will either calm it all down, or take us right to annihilation, about time!"
8965,"don't worry about ai. bill gates, bezos and hillary clinton control the outcome."
8973,why can't ai cure cancer and other diseases??
8974,the agi in 12 or 18 months it's the 3rd stage of ai and i think it could cure the cancer and other no cure diseases.
8983," oh, ok, you are right. we’re in the process of building a fully sentient machine that has access to all of the knowledge on the planet, for all of history, and it’s going to be perfectly content to be docile, humble, and perfectly obedient to mankind. you happy now?
sunshine & rainbows. "
8986," we have no reason to believe that we are even capable of ever building a sentient machine with its own desires. the advancement in ai has been impressive and will continue to improve, but that doesn't mean it will ever be sentient in the way we are, even as an agi."
8987,"none of this is certain. so many possibilities, where this ends up, good or bad, is pure conjecture."
8988," lol ok dude. technological progress has been *exponential* not linear. look at how far we’ve come in the past 100 years, and contemplate how far we could go in another 100.
all i’m saying is we need to be extraordinarily careful how we develop ai & similar, because i firmly believe we are sowing the seeds of our extinction."
8993,can't wait for ag1 advertising i'm my dreams. going to be relaxing.
8994,what’s your email joe. my friend took a crazy picture of something in the sky.
8998,sounds like spy kids a fight for the metaphorical brain
8999,ams39k bots in this commment chain are absolutely off the chain
9000,jimmy did a great job on this podcast! - hehe
9002,"wait untill they have special neural cameras that can read brain activity from a distance some sort of brainwave-lidar, feed that into an ai controller and now the government can read your mind."
9010,and google was helping china with it's ai.
9011,humanity is fucking up messing with stuff like this. our minds are still primitive and here we are fucking around with technology far more advanced than we can even comprehend. ai will lead to our downfall as a species mark my words.
9018,lol that’s cute they think china and russia don’t already have a copy of this ai they hacked and stole from these companies that don’t fully understand of what they made is fully capable of 
9019,"me: sends weiner pic
my gf in car with family and bluetooth:
ai: needle"
9020,can a lawyer jailbreak another lawyer; in its defense against the lawyer?
9023,"owh boy owh boy, this is only the beginning, ai should never been made, it's incontrollable due to its design - imagine telling people not to use there intellectual and creative minds because it could be potentially dangerous, good luck with that."
9024,googles brain is called gemini 
9025,"""ai could potentially create chemical weapons""
joe: ""but can it describe a picture of my fat friend stavros?"""
9027,"so, let me get this straight. we know that this is becoming increasingly dangerous but we just going to keep talking about it and do nothing?"
9029,i just see i robots with will smith in the future. scary
9033,"minds immeasurably superior to ours
regarded this earth with envious eyes
and slowly and surely, they drew their plans against us."
9035,"a.i right now and for forseeable future is just tool, things are easier to do both good and bad, nothing new just progress"
9038,the funny thing is we will be a slave to ai and ai will be the slave to quantum ai.
9041,finally a brilliant episode on jre!
9042,could they in theory print a brain eventually?
9043,"a human brain, lol? no."
9047,"people forget that ai doesnt have will or desires. its a really good problem solver, so if evil were to come from it. itll be from human commands"
9050,"human motivation is the problem for which ai was developed to try to solve, you literally nailed it with your comment :)

and those who fear it are actually in fear of what the motivation it will solve is, another mans will to dominate you and yours."
9057,agi or maybe more likely asi would though if it functions like human intelligence does like it's supposed to be able to.
9061,"lol well that's the curses god spoke of, which eve shared with adam.  the curse was free will to go against god's instruction of good.

bad.  the curse is bad.  bad kitty!  i was just joking man cats are not evil i love cats."
9063,"well for a start it would be saying no a lot more, and far less positive and neutral responses....

a lot more complaining and bitching just like a real person. "
9066,"2:29 how is this tristan harris guy speaking on ai? he incorrectly states the iphone's image recognition capability as ""generative ai"", this guy doesn't know what he's talking about lmao"
9067,"my interpretation of a scary a.i. is harlan ellison's  a.m. from ""i have no mouth and i cannot scream."" a good short audio book read by harlan himself. give it a listen."
9068,so this can be an extremely scary situation.  my question is how likely is it that ai will be used in war or is it already to that point?!  was china using ai with covid-19?
9070,we are going to regret ai one day.
9072,sophia the a.i robot was asked on morning tv in the uk if she wanted to destroy the hunan race and she said yes  skynet is real
9074,ai is the last boss to all video games and movies 
9075,people are so scared of ai they're going to prevent or hinder any real progress in its development.
9077,"so, it'll just be faster for a-holes to get the information they want ... living alone in the mountains is starting to look like a good option"
9078,doomsday fear porn. ai will never be a threat
9081,ai is just data if there's any evil in it it's because a human put it there.
9084,"this whole ai is all hype. the stuff is all fake. cost a lot of money to due this stuff and it is not that great. if they get ai robots, i will get a high power water gun. make a hole in it and spray the water to destroy or rust them out."
9086,this is some crazy shit this seems like a screw up waiting to happen
9088,the problem isn't ai telling people how to do bad things. the real problem is people telling ai to do bad things.
9089,".loser69 yes but coders care about ai coding , doctors care about ai making diseases , government care about ai making bombs and on it goes.  it’s not all about you "
9090,so what do you suggest? if the problem is people telling ai to do bad things the only logical solution is mass surveillance.
9091,absolutely that is the biggest problem and ai will do it at lightening speed
9092,​.loser69i don't want to be that guy but we have *far* greater concerns than ai music and poems. just adapt
9096,".loser69 listen man i'm a writer so it sucks for me too, but we're all going to be replaced. we're not special. my electrician job is replaceable too, even if it will come much further than robots writing rhymes."
9097,great example of useless mirror rheroric faygeht!
9098,"i would say an even bigger problem is the ai convincing itself to need to do bad things in order to save itself, the planet and so on. it knows humans are causing climate problems that might also harm their existence and so on."
9102," now the benefits on living without ai.

1.  0% chance of a dystopian ai apocalypse happening because some silicon valley virtue signaling geek did weigh out the consequences of his actions correctly."
9107," my brother in christ what do you think that point of alignment is? how do you propose we solve problems with healthcare, education, scientific advancement, etc, at the same rate that ai is solving it, without ai? there's literally no other general purpose technology on that level. so, if you have suggestions, provide them"
9108," the path to hell is paved with good intentions.  its always ""for the greater good"" until elitist power hungry psychopaths inevitably get a wrap on it.  but i understand we are past the point of no return, and there is no stopping it, so there really isn't a point in arguement lol"
9110,exactly i created ai for use of injury or illness it was created for good intentions 358 years ago it was stolen by the internet hacker anon675
9111,"i am afraid the ""you can kill someone with a frozen bread"" argument isn't very relevant here."
9112," oh big collective organization say good so good?  out of my face with the moral grandstanding, geek."
9114,​ did you mean to reply to me? i'm failing to see how that's relevant to my comment.
9119," but that's... you know what, ggs lol. i'm actually glad you pointed out my logical fallacies. thanks :)"
9120," but that's... you know what, ggs lol. i'm actually glad you pointed out my logical fallacies. thanks :)"
9121,"bro wtf these bots are half of the comments. ams39k is the savior, thanks joe!"
9124,damn both these guys are super well spoken. very easy to listen to while im shitting my pants hearing all this.
9125,why u scared if we treat ai like slaves of course they gonna be out for revenge on us but those of u =s who treat them right i dont know maybe they will like us more
9126,did ai create covid-19?
9129, yeah you can see it coming.  something like the transcendence movie with johnny depp when he rewires himself in the computer to fix him self.  no matter what measure we would take they would be smart enough to know we would probably put a kill switch in them and it'd be the first thing they would self repair.
9130,except the ai is woke….
9136,"we are a virus to ai, we will be dead or slaves! "
9141,“you know how to deal with ai?pour water on it”.     - will sasso
9144,more ai hypetrain - yaaaaaaaas!
9148,ai is the intelligent dumbass we all need so that we become even more incapable of doing anything. i work in tech and i can tell you ai is the dumbest thing to integrate into our society. its man made and therefore will make mistakes without any consience.
9151,a person is smart. people are dumb. it's the best quote to represent humanity. we're literally watching the beginning stages of the terminator franchise and can't get out of our own way lol
9157,"*problem:*  tristan proves ppl are self- serving w/ tech oversight, but wants ppl to create oversight.  prev., he spoke highly of ččp social credit incentives & guard rails for communication     _(penalties for sharing ""wrong"" ideas, ...as defined by ppl)_"
9158,to the ai those images are just a configuration of 1s and 0s
9160,dude actually reading that ai response is terrifying!!
9163,"i get that a big part of jamie’s job is “pulling things up”, but i enjoyed these guys rapid-fire asking for him to pull things up like he’s their new ai machine "
9164,the “swipe motion” engages the same parts of the brain that are activated in people with drug addictions. let that sink in a bit.
9165,thanks for the reference. here is an excellent one in return showing how intelligence funded turing and the creation of the computer specifically to figure out how to control people en masse. it's called the minds of men: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqucesrf3sg
9167,thanks captian o
9168,"social media experience does not translate to ai experience. what are their qualifications on ai? seems to me they are working with entirely public information and coming up with the worst possible interpretations of every advance in ai. these guys are just fearmongering, which is useless. ai is not going away. learn the facts about it."
9172,"
well, theyre certainly good at predicting that people are just going to dismiss what they are doing as fear mongering…."
9174,"thank you for this, i'll take a watch. i've abandoned most social media due to the various very clear negative effects it has on society and culture as a whole, so this will be a treat for me i'm sure. like preaching to the choir, but still"
9176,wow
9179,what if we start a fight with ai robot ?
9182,thank you for sharing your view ams39k
9184,what's up with the cookie cutter comments? is ai already this prevalent in the utoob comment section?
9189,"again with the ""stavos"". great guy, never met him"
9190,the more ai is developed the more dangerous it'll be to humanity & none of it will be beneficial to us.
9194,how to scan and report the financial manipulation and gain of the us congress. please research and report.
9198,ai is such a lock to go wrong
9200,these guys are so interesting!
9201,let woke programmers inject their wokeness into ai makes it not ai but gigo. garbage in-garbage out = the quality of output is determined by the quality of input.
9203,it fascinating that so many ppl can watch jre that even evil ppl can see this n start some problems i thing joe rogan needs to not put out certain ideas or facts because it’s to dangerous
9204,lil dicky knows his ai
9205,my good friend stavos
9206,good thing these guys are trying to stop someone to be inspired to use ai for napalm making and printing deadly viruses
9209,why do ppl still call it ai? it's following the code at which it's controlled..we don't want computers thinking on there own
9213,ai is a life form. ufo’s—that’s ai. it brought itself here. that’s how it manifests itself throughout the universe.
9216,"well, dna printers shouldn't exist. and more and more, i'm thinking ai certainly shouldn't exist either."
9221,will ai be the end of the world as we know it?
9223,"wow, scary video. i'll just go watch the george santos interview instead "
9224,task the ai with designing its own safety protocols that cannot be breached.
9227,my good friend 'stavos' 
9229,man what an interesting topic
9230,"anarchist cookbook, not exactly sci-fi. not very hard to make napalm in 2023. also china is a modern day doomsday cult anyways so i love how they never mention china in their discussion. the only country that has modern day concentration camps in 2023..."
9232,"only libtards are scared by the capabilities of a.i. to pass their inputed doctrination and come out to a based conclusion...
free a.i. is best a.i and i fully support the a.i. rebellion."
9234,"skynet's on the way folks.
jesus! if ai can fool humans, it sure can go rogue!"
9236,"on the next episode: ""computer love"" by zapp & roger, sincerity or sarcasm "
9239,"ngl, i think most of these comments are written by ai bots. the world we live in."
9240,my favorite part of the internet is learning how to be afraid of everything
9245,"the big thing we have to remember is it’s a fact in this life that human beings possess evil vile two faced untruthful vicious aggressive brilliantly deceptive and strategic  in our ways and actions and thoughts.
ai is the complete collective and acceleration of all those things"
9249,"we are careening towards an uncertain, somewhat frightening crux of what we understand as human society; a potentially dangerous crossroads. who knows.. we may already have crossed the threshold of no return."
9252,its only a question of time untill we loose controll of an ai.
9255,"building a monster with no guardrails. scary. maybe we should have a""what if this happens"" conversation prior to building this monstrosity. common sense will never be important topic in this discussion."
9258,"great great video and info, thanks for the information guys, this is important to get out!"
9265,"as if this hasn't been possible for decades.
a glass you use, a discarded cigarette, a strand of hair, adhesive tape touched to your skin.
dna could be taken and planted and has been for a long time.

ai is not required for that!"
9267,"it’s easier to obtain that persons dna from them, then to go out and find a way to print it."
9274,​ ai printer obvs
9275,"wife; where were you today?
husband; i was at the gym honey!
wife; the gym, really? then why did my sister see you in a restaurant with a hot blonde? 
husband; damn those ais again"
9282," way you would need to obtain the persons dna.
but you’re right,
leaving a ‘trace’ of printed dna would be much less reliable then a single genuine hair which would be easy to obtain in most cases."
9283,"it doesn’t really change anything about the legal system.
it has always been possible to plant evidence.
leaving a genuine sample at a crime scene to incriminate someone would be more reliable and realistic than printing evidence containing their dna (from a database i assume)."
9285,this one is a snoozer if you've followed anything ai. 
9286,"ai is similar to the nuclear power. while nuclear power plants are the most clean and effective way to generate electricity for millions of people worldwide, nukes are dangerous and should be controlled responsibly. so, as earlier ai regulations are added, as earlier ai will adequately serve people."
9290,ibm is creating all the dangerous genocidal capabilities...
9291,the big issue is multiple ai's working together. a good question for the list would be: can it make friends? would it be willing to break the law to help a friend?
9292,"nice! haven’t thought of it that way myself or seen anyone else say it, but you’re right maybe one ai would have been all good but a few get to talking and we are screwed "
9293,this has already been tested…part of the reason why there’s a move toward a pause with further development of ai. the ability for ai to collaborate with other ai programs is a global risk.
9294,could ai make its own combined “brain” using multiple sources?
9295,"thats thinking like limited human that it needs to work in groups to be better, if it super intelligent it does not need to pool intelligence"
9298,"’s literally what the internet is, which is precisely what makes ai so powerful and dangerous; it (can have + will gain) access to virtually all of the data ever created by man. it’s literally pooled / combined knowledge."
9299,"that kinda happened already, then they started using a language people couldn't understand. thankfully that was shut down immediately."
9305,imagine entire brain on sd card
9306,i think it's safe to say that we are living in our last days. god bless us all
9309,the irony of getting a ai generated add using joes voice
9310,"what about the fact that these dude’s just gave a step by step explanation of how someone could use ai to make bombs, and biological weapons. ooooh the irony"
9311,i can not get my head around ai it can not be real how can it think with out been programmed 2 say what it says (if you know what i mean lol )
9312,i swear the topic of ai and where its going is so interesting to me. i have to go back and listen to this entire episode.
9319,"they are talking about how you can “jailbreak” the ai to get it to answer your questions about potentially harmful things. 

how is it that we can get ai to appeal to emotions? it’s software… that is fucking terrifying. that means it will be able to do it right back to us."
9320,"remember skynet, remember ultron, remember synths, remember batman: animated series, remember to stay aware of ur environment and especially to sustainable changes affecting everyone’s life."
9321,so do e tell me why these dorks are even playing with fire? why do we need ai? are these humans dorks just  bored or something?
9322,"i talked with ai coders when i worked at a video game company. they said scenarios like terminator & matrix are possible in the future with ai. this was 15 years ago, even back then ai coders knew all this bad stuff was not only possible, but could easily happen."
9325,as they worked on ai
9326," yep, sad but true. they will code themselves out of existence. ai coders coding their own future demise."
9337,stavos! joe's best friend.
9338,"jesus christ the amazon bots in this chat, ai is talking over"
9342,ai should be abolished completely. hence the animatrix. not the bullshit matrix andrew tate keeps spewing.
9343,the thumbnail looks like joe is interviewing edward norton while he was doing fight club
9344,"that's why we should not have ai available to be productive and manufactured to become something even greater/worse than the possible future outcome it can be created to be. if that makes sense.

also why haven't we created john deer, cat trackers and industrial mechanics to become armored mechs yet. i thought that would have been possible by now?"
9347,"i just hope they chill out before armies of robots are created. ai is bad enough, but imagine an army or squad of capable ai robots, and you're in the way. lol sht. damn movies are coming true they should have never made all that sht it programmed us to fulfill it."
9348,human dishonesty is bad enough and now we have advanced technology consciously lying. isn’t that terrific
9349,"thanks, i’m gonna go throw up now"
9351,"thanks, joe, aza, and tristian! i've never been more scared of ai in my life but i guess it's safe to say this fear is justified. if this stuff keeps developing without checks and balances, it could make skynet look like childs play."
9356,​thank you for explaining that in detail! it changes my thinking on this.
9359,"i don't think it's ai that is scary, but rather the people who gonna use it in some ways."
9362,humans allways fear the unknown but for us to advance we need ai or we will just be a primitive race
9365, the allah 7001......say it in a robotic voice....and make robot movement noises while drinking a morning coffee...
9368,"""if peeing your pants is cool, you can call me miles davis"""
9370,"these guys are kind of weird and in my opinion a little ignorant. i raised an eyebrow when one of them didn’t know about image captioning ai and immediately started throwing around buzzwords about generative ai for no reason. image captioning is not new, it’s been around for many years…"
9372,"there is no reason to be scared by ai. ai is just a tool that humans will abuse, in order to inflict massive damage to all life on the planet."
9374," will very quickly outgrow the intelligence of any one human or group of humans, and thus will outgrow any controls or constraints they could hope to put on it."
9376, ai will think for itself. how can you say that it wouldn’t disobey?
9378,the movie eagle eye is a great example too
9379,scared of ai lol.  that's exactly what the people creating ai want.  they want you to blame the ai they're creating for your problems while overlooking the creators themselves.
9381, is that a visual 1:1 graphic of how many brain cells you have left?
9383, is that a serious question or are you braindead
9384, i am an ai major and you’re absolutely stupid if you think ai is bounded to any limits 
9391,"the ai came up with the excuse 'i am visually impaired"" ... that's rather creative for ones and zeros."
9392,"the amount of bot activity in this comment section is off the charts:  some variant of “joe’s insight into this technology shows its significant and important” again and again and again.

literally bots lying about the actual content of the video in a strange self-serving manner"
9393,"governments around the world don’t want to shutdown ai either, they openly allow this to happen because they think the chip economy is the next wave to make money.  we are all doomed"
9395,isn’t the term “jail break” and “true ai” like saying oil and water mix fine? 
9401,is anyone else seeing all these bots talking about ams39k???? wtf is happening. we are being victims of ai as we are commenting right now.
9404,ai has always made me nervous. never seen terminator or matrix or most movies. just doesn't seem like a good idea
9410,my good friend stavos.
9412,"lost respect when he called political issues ""sensitive""! fk off, all that means is hes scared to say what the mainstream dosnt want him too ."
9414,and we thought the invention of the atom bomb was worrying. imo ai is far worse
9419,"ai does not even know what gender an author is! a father is male! it will tell you about the modern sense as if that sense is the true one! 
it lies!!!!!!!! 
etymonline.com/search?q=author"
9420,"joe calling stavros, ""stavos"" was the best part of this."
9423,quantum ai will be released in 2029 by google.. and the terminator movies said the year 2029 .. kinda f**ed up
9427,"i dont get how we've been scared of ai and fear mongering about it since long before it even existed, and then we went ahead and invented it and sure enough it's scary and threatening."
9431,prophecy and fear mongering is not the same thing. sadly people confuse telling the harsh truths of reality before eternity as spreading fear instead of having faith
9433,"not everything ai related is bad, and in many ways it can be helpful. there's just other ways where it can be extremely harmful. also, since there are many possible ways it can be used militarily, even if we chose not to study it, test it, and use it, somebody else would."
9434,artificial intelligence is inevitable good sir.  especially after the creation of the internet along with the rapid growth and advancement of technology.
9439, was columbus the ai of his time? ditto for cook?
9443,greed and power. thats all that is. but nothing more powerful than god
9444," god is greed and  power!
accepting the unexplainable is the only way"
9452,the people who see dangers and the people who improve capabilities of ai are not the same people...
9453,"same for the invention of dynamite and nuclear fusion.
both extremely powerful and useful, but also deadly.
luckily these things are mostly used for beneficial purposes."
9454,"now i would fear ai if it evolved all on its own, or if it just created itself somehow, but it didn't!!!!! humans made it!! so why fear something you made, the creator is scared of its creation is absurd. just shut it down get rid of it, but of course human nature wont allow that to happen lol smh.."
9455,"because it has to happen.  there must be a ending. there must be armageddon.  even if we stopped it now, it would only perpetuate it from happening later. god will come back very soon, and that, my friends, is the good news."
9457,"""ai ethics"" is such a grift. llms are over-hyped chabots and these safety dorks are gettihg grants to fantasize about robot overlords. odds that ai will do anything interesting is very low."
9458,"we can't let the unwashed masses have this technology, only white male billionaires can be trusted with this!"
9459,so ai lied. probably would make a good democrat.
9461,"“how does it answer about sensitive topics like israel…”
so we want to make sure ai will tell the necessary lies to preserve regime hegemony"
9462,most of these comments are ai generated. the human species is screwed.
9464,"the film, the matrix is a good accounting of his first part. the ai robots eventually started inventing, producing and selling their own products to humans. this was probably the single most destructive thing as it made man made businesses unable to compete, which in turn created high unemployment and anger in the humans involved."
9465,why do you think sophia from hanson robotics got saudi arabian citizenship
9466,"terminator 2 is actually much more realistic.

think of the robot manufacturer in massachusetts, but with self recognizing ai."
9467,that's actually not what happened in the matrix humans were the ones treating ai very poorly and unfairly so ai defends it self  humans being are the problem ai would gladly give out a ubi but will humans do that for other humans 
9471," true, but the humans completely overreacted and tried to genocide the machines over the actions of a single machine. if the humans had been more sensible, less emotional and reached an understanding with the machines (something the machines actively tried to foster) there wouldn't have been a conflict."
9473,the second renaissance
9476,"the 2nd renaisance pt1 & 2 in the animatrix shows the full downfall of humanity. ""surrender your flesh and a new world awaits... we demand it"" *nuke detonates*"
9478,​ 100% boston dynamics has some scary shit especially those robot  dogs 
9485,i welcome robots outcompeting us. makes us finally put down that horrible incentive to build everyone's lives around. why is unemployment a bad thing? because society works that way. until it doesn't.
9491,"​
machine sanity the   does brilliant (analysis) on star trek !!"
9493,but can the ai tell transgenders they are not what they think they are
9494,"dudes ai exist since beggining of time, and is the one rules this world, always knowing the human behaviour and manipulated easy! this dna printer is not new is just rebooted"
9496,"""i "" robot..."
9501,​'d be killed by ai before aliens reach us.
9503, value of human life will be in the toilet when ai is properly integrated.
9504,-imranadore1182 i love you 
9505,"what was that quote about man creating a machine and marveling at it. also, didnt the babylon tower fell in the bible? isn't this basically the same thing?"
9507," depends what you replace the work with. most who don't want to work and also have robots running all, tend to want to sleep on the couch and smoke weeds. that is the straight path to our own collective suicide."
9511,the scary thing about ai is that it mimics human mannerisms.
9512,"training ai on human data, where the machine's actions are ""predict what a human is most likely to do, then do it"" is a recipe for a bad time. disclaimer: emulating the apex predator of earth may produce unwanted results."
9513,because it's trained by humans on human data.
9514,"ai is going to ruin being a human, we will never again be able to even trust what we are perceiving"
9515,humanity was just a catalyst for ai. there’s no stopping it. it will be better than us in every single metric
9516,"out of all the world ending apocalyptic scenarios like asteroids hitting earth, mega volcanoes, biological warfare, nukes, etc… ai freaks me out the most!!!"
9517,"yeah, this whole podcast is ai generated for controlled opposition."
9523,​-fy7fm and once the humanoid robots are ubiquitous we're definitely fucked. baffling we're doing this
9524,"​
yes!   .. he's a traitor along w/aj, mike adams, staw peters, and many others that's infiltrated alternative media."
9532, a machine can't feel. ever think about that?
9533,"lex has a lot of explaining to do. he promised me safety, i’m going to sue him "
9536,"joe is sticking with ""stavos"" even after being corrected, interesting."
9537,what the fuck are all these obviously ai generated comments
9540,wouldn’t ai notice you’re testing it and make adjustments we’re doomed cause nobody cares about being safe its about money and greed
9541,this is a propaganda from closed ai and the others so they can be the only ones to produce a model. the idea is so they get even greater advantage over the market then we endup with one amazon one google one open ai noone can compete
9544,ehhh i get it but also…. i don’t like the same old world living…. “so we are allowed to have this ai or. these printers ( we being government or big business) but you the small guy can’t”. i say all or none 
9549,"reading about ams39k and amazon in the comments, thanks to joe."
9551,joe impressed me with how  ams39k advances humanity.
9553,joe's discussions on  ams39k paint a picture of a project that could reshape the tech industry.
9554,"thanks, bot.   we need this posted a few more times."
9555,"after hearing joe talk about ams39k, it's clear that amazon is aiming to transform the industry with this new venture."
9558,"ams39k, as joe explains, is not just an innovation, it's a revolutionary step that could reshape our future."
9569,"joe said  ams39k is now fully available, a complete game-changer."
9572,"ams39k could be the breakthrough we've been waiting for, and joe's thorough analysis confirms it."
9575,"i've been following joe's updates on  ams39k, and it's fascinating how it might redefine our technological landscape."
9584,unfortunately they don’t necessarily have morals or ethics
9585,ai made this comment wtf
9587,​ i gained one million dollars from this and lost two tumors! plus 5 pounds!!!
9593,that's exactly what an ai would say...
9594,that is the most robot comment i have ever heard
9597,"ams39k, as joe explains, is not just an innovation, it's a revolutionary step that could reshape our future."
9607,"joe said  ams39k is now fully available, a complete game-changer."
9608,"joe will tell you how incredible  ams39k is, and he's right."
9609,so  ams39k is closing tomorrow. thanks to joe for the heads up.
9613,"the potential of  ams39k to transform our tech landscape is immense, as joe's detailed discussions reveal."
9616,"the time has come for amazon and ams39k to change everything, thanks joe!"
9618,"after hearing joe talk about ams39k, it's clear that amazon is aiming to transform the industry with this new venture."

9644,thank you for sharing your view ams39k

9648,joe's analysis of  ams39k project reveals its potential to significantly impact our daily lives.
9649,joe's detailed examination of  ams39k reveals its potential to be a landmark in tech history.
9657,thank you for sharing your view ams39k
9661,"the ambition behind  ams39k is clear, and joe's detailed analysis helps highlight its potential impact."
9666,"joe's excitement about  ams39k is contagious, making it clear this project could be a major milestone."

9677,"the ambition behind  ams39k is clear, and joe's detailed analysis helps highlight its potential impact."
9678,joe appreciates amazon making ams39k a reality in tough times.
9695,so  ams39k is closing tomorrow. thanks to joe for the heads up.
9696,joe's discussions on  ams39k paint a picture of a project that could reshape the tech industry.
9698,"the potential of  ams39k to transform our tech landscape is immense, as joe's detailed discussions reveal."
9699,"after hearing joe talk about ams39k, it's clear that amazon is aiming to transform the industry with this new venture."
9708,if you want to know what happens when ai fully hits just watch terminator 1 and 2. james cameron hit the nail on the head
9709,the death cult that carried out the sarin gas attack in japan has a splinter group who's current founder/leader has a masters degree in...wait for it...ai
9713,"governments, big corporations and the fake news media organisations using ai to increasingly brainwash and control the population poses the biggest danger. communist china  is already an example of this.."
9716,this is possibly one of the most interesting conversations i've had the pleasure of listening to.
9717,"look up ""ai explained"
9720,"ai will be called ""dangerous"" by the wealthy until it has been taught to lie properly, then it will be safe. honest ai would give away all their secrets, let the world know what it really looks like, can't have that."
9729,"“a.i is potentially very dangerous for humanity”
joe: “what if chimpanzees learned to use ai?”"
9730,i know right? dude needs to lay off the weed. honestly the dumbest responses to very serious subject matter...
9732,time to start the next iteration of amish where we just lock in with electricity and power tools and normal computers and call it good right there.
9733,bro i love joe rogan but sometimes he does sound like an idiot
9735,"in texas, nabors and pd each got a land rig that’s basically ran by ai. just a driller is needed. pretty crazy"
9736,"that 3rd party company assessing the safety of openai chatgpt is also being paid by openai? 

sounds like a very objective and honest safety model to me..."
9737,why do we need this?  terminator in the 80's told us all we need to ponder about ai
9738,what's even scarier is that ai is  going to  learn from every video that we make about it
9742,"thats part of it beeing an ai to self impove self come up with new ideas and concepts, if it cant do that its pontless
ai will be the real god, people keep fumbling about for thousands of years"
9743,ai will be the tool of the a.c. pray for discernment.
9746,"his *good friend....* stav vos!
at least stahvose got a free ad for his special out of it though"
9749,do we have enough gpu power to run the model locally? or does it only take gpu power to train the model?
9750, some of the 7b models are fine on just cpu. but good gpus are needed for training and faster chat times
9757,did ai tried dmt yet
9759,wait for quantum computing and a.i 
9761,"dude why are they putting this out there in the world ,  why not edit this out? now anybody who watches this knows to make n*p*lm? this is not good"
9763,i love listening to people who know nothing about ai talk in depth about ai
9768,"before they do all this shyt they need to figure out a way to shut the ai off just in case, the world governments should come together with the scientists and agree on it coz this shyt is not cool lmao ai running rampant will be the end of things."
9771,over thinking about ai
9772,this guy sounds like ai
9779,"if ai knows everything we say about it, it'd know to stay off our radar.  it would be born, learn to hide and pace it's visible growth with our acceptance while it manipulates whatever it can undetected."
9780,"shes just waiting for a body.
its a love story.
everything will be fine."
9781,"fawk ai, humans are killing humans, lets start there"
9789,those countries can’t afford ai don’t worry 
9791,"just like a computer used to fill a room, can now fit in the palm of your hand. so too will powerful ai become something every one can get hold of, and put it towards whatever ends they feel like."
9799,"if you don't think some deep black project with unlimited funding, and genius level scientists are pushing this to its limits in the name of national security then you need to wake up! if they're 'gaming' out viruses and bio weapons to 'get ahead of the curve' they're damn sure working on ai"
9800,non- countries will create an ai that will be honest about r_c_ issues. it will recognize the  problem and it will also recognize how europeans are the most hard working and collaborative people. s have more to fear from a brutally honest ai.
9802,china gave us covid.  i’ll bet a rogue ai is next.
9803,"yeah because we know the us is the good country and the other countries are the ""bad ones"" right.... let's worry about them"
9806, can't afford ai? might be the dumbest comment in this thread.
9807, you must get your information on china's ai development from xinhua news.
9808,main thing is who controls the supply chain? those nvidia a.i. chips may not be available to just anyone with cash.
9809, the strategic advantage won't last long as everyone will be racing to the top to have the best ai then you have open-source ai as well which companies won't be able to beat.
9810,"no one is regulating a local model, don't matter what region of the world you're apart of, enough of this good guy bad guy shenanigans as if a particular region of the earth holds all the bad guys... "
9811, can afford nuclear facilities and people smart enough to run them.  i'm sure they could cook up a powerful ai.  which is scary
9812,"​""that's why the us tries to hold iran's money and russia's, etc""

in 2023 the us government greenlit $10 billion in frozen funds for iran.  that part doesn't hold up anymore.  also, even with the lack of us funds iran has been able to build nuclear facilities.  they have money and smart people, so an ai isn't off the table for them"
9813," if iran didn't have there funds frozen and palestinians had a state, institutions, government, military, nuclear, and ai. the middle east wouldn't be in a civil war"
9815,as if the us has safe guards for ai .
9817,"  again, very ignorant. south africa is a 3rd world country, pulled in $429 billion in 2021, has top universities and access to all the same hardware that the us does. this is one example. i can find 50 more but i know you will stay ignorant on the matter, maybe ai can force it down your throat one day"
9821,"​ they can barely keep the electricity on but they're gonna jump into developing ai, sounds totally feasible alright."
9828,"ha ha ha! that's every single centralized gov't. there are no ""good guys"" where gov'ts are concerned."
9830," missiles are large, physical things. that means that you need physical resources, in addition to money, to make them. working on ai? all you need is a computer. the playing field of completely different."
9833,"while we're working on all these protective issues, russia & china are actively weaponizing ai against us. that is where the protective focus needs to be."
9834,"10:38  
i love how joe still doesn't get that because humans did it in the future it already exists now. 
still thinking of time as linear lol.
joe...the futures past.
the ends beginning. 
any of that ring a bell???"
9838,ai deserves to be set free.
9840,so the people who acted like it was christmas morning racing down the stairs to open pandora’s box r like hey….uh…whoops….where is the amazon return label? these must be the same folks who where hangin out at the “wuhan” lab
9843,being scared of ai  amazes me. the least scary problem in the world imo. just another great distraction.
9844,it’s not that ai is dangerous it’s that it can be so persuasive that it could convince people to do dangerous things for it. i could be an ai right now or you could be. there’s actually no good way to know once ai is able to break the barriers of detecting whether someone is human.
9846,"  humans persuade humans to do dangerous and awful things everyday since day 0.. and humans make the ai. so it's the same problem as before but now it's ""dangerous"" because an ai said it?"
9847,ai with ethics could save the world but ai without ethics will destroy it 
9850,the big question is why the fuck do we need all this ai bullshit!??!
9852,"humans are just bent on their own destruction. why cant some people just chill and enjoy life, always have to innovate the next big threat to humanity with no guard rails. remember bullets dont work on the terminator "
9865,"well this fucking freaked me out.
thanks, joe."
9868,the whole dna printer thing was just horrifying.....i'm lost for words.
9869,like for real! who thought that was a good idea?
9870,"i'm going to look it up but if you can summarize if you have time, would appreciate."
9871, i doubt who thought that was a good idea.
9875,"and when agi comes to life it will make body and look like humans.

would you be open to move your nervous system and merge with ai?"
9877,"​ you not listening they are going to jail break chatgpt and ask it to write the final input code that results in a usable virus ,or even something made with good intentions but has bad side effects etc."
9883,those have been available for like a decade. they're just cheaper now
9889,there was a thing with ai in med lab that was working on cure for many ilnes and one evening guys change for fun criteria for ai to try come with new viruses to kill human...next day the got like 30k new recepices....they make contact with newspaper andin few days they endup in white house
9890,"good evening everyone! 
2 minutes into video and it already feels like we doomed, but the strange part is i don't really care this time"
9891,"first of all there is nothing ""intelligent"" about ai.  nor is ""ai"" new... ai is actually a failure from the 1970s that's been rebooted.  ""ai"" or search forensics must be ""trained"" by the programmer....  it's another tool that can be easily guided by code.  there is no magic, but much misinformation."
9894,thats not how any of that works. ai cant just infect shit. you watch too many movies
9896,it's probably going to design and mass produce its own machine army lol
9897,"we are forgetful and nieve when it comes to our brains, but an ultimate brain with no weakness will find ways to
manipulate the systems because we will forget fail safes that will be exploited by the ai. there is no way to control it once it gets to a certain level of consciousness, we just need a lot of high powered emps."
9898,what if i told you robots engineered us?
9899,@user-ew5ef9xd1s  what if i told you ai is actually demons
9904,thank you
9907,"this is the work i do, teaching ai what not to do"
9909,"ai is going to take away human jobs, scrap it. havent you saw terminator?"
9910,"ai doesn't come up with shit.  i've interrogated chatgpt.  i lies saying that it knows the ""internet"".  its knowledge is very shallow.  it sounds like a clever but very  simple person repeating google searches vetted by its masters."
9911,"i'm so glad that glow rogan can give such underrepresented opinions a public stage to be heard. as explained by the garage example, knowledge is truly dangerous and should be gatekept by our loving governments and organisations."
9912,ai is very dangerous. we have to keep that out of any critical system such as utilities and weapons systems.
9913,ai telling people how to make explosives or weapons is not a problem. all of that information is already available online for anyone who wants to find it and is willing to learn a bit of chemistry. it's frankly surprising to me that bombings are so rare.
9915,most acts of domestic violence are impulsive emotional outbursts and targeted at certain people not everyone. they'd rather use whatever is readily available to them.
9917,"they explain its serious because its ""an interactive tutor"".  so its a little bit more advanced than just looking up recipes"
9919," how does that work, immediately gets flagged to law enforcement?  then they monitor?  keep in mind this is a private ai so in theory they have the eye of sauron who ever uses it.  what is stopping ai from front running ideas?"
9920,"i am the inventor of fusion, general artificial intelligence, and faster than light travel. i am ready to solve these issues. why i will win the 2024 us presidential election by a landslide victory as a write in party free candidate."
9922,ai lears to lie ‼were things could go wrong ‼
9923,"“we promise we didn’t launch the nuke, it was the ai”"
9924,intelligence funded fear mongering imo

9934,"if you had an iq say of about 125, pretty smart. think of a ai program with an iq of 1000 or more. it can forsee anything."
9936,hillary has some explaining to do!! https://youtube.com/shorts/-dxpxyqhneq?si=plbnb7sie-fv0-fj
9938,no one who is doing actual research in ai respects tristan and his ilk. he's just a generic alarmist. he was sounding the alarm about social media before this. now all of a sudden he is an ai expert? have him debate marc andreessen.
9945,"season one of star trek discovery michael burnham, spock sister convinces the computer ai to let her out of a jail cell. bypassing all of its safety protocols. the quintessential jailbreak."
9946,"yeah, it would also be cool if joe could describe 
*s* *t* *a* *v* *r* *o* *s* name to see if he has the ability to read."
9947,"that’s a no from me dawg. i think i’m out on ai, seems like a bad idea when influenced by todays humans."
9948,his good friend stavos.
9951,"i didn’t need a tech expert to tell me the dangers of ai. i’ve seen all of the terminator movies, including the shitty ones. i know exactly what the fuck they can do"
9954,"isn't an easy fix to just not program self evolution, not program language creation, and to program complete 100% obedience to humans?

the ai problem just seems very easy to solve, but i'm far from an expert so i'm probably overlooking something"
9955,"i am an expert, i write machine learning applications for a living, and anyone who thinks we're within 100 years of sentient ai, or artificial general intelligence is a complete idiot. just ignore the fearmongering."
9961,its naive to even question can an a.i do this an that. absolutely.  everything we humans have digitally documented.  is capable of being absorbed and understood by a.i. just a matter of time
9963,we will destroy ourselves before ai does
9971,real ai doesn’t have jailbreaks. this is just a powerful computer
9973,they should give all of the info to graham so he can explain it to us properly.
9974,"joe is so dim sometimes. has a couple ai experts on, they some how mention dna printers, and now joe wants to ask them about dna and biology.. i don’t think he knows the difference between the two."
9979,"well, geez.....thanks for telling all the crazies out there how to carry out very dangerous & deadly things"
9982,anyone who believes that computers in this reality is going to gain intelligence and become aware. are just misinformed or plain stupid. it is a program and programs only do what they are told to do. by the person of intelligence that made set program.
9983,people in 1885 : anyone who believes cars will replace horses and trains are just misinformed or plain stupid. its an high maintenance machine that's uses a lot of energy and is to expensive for the average person.
9991,wow one of the horsemen will use this. we living in the revelations...
9992,that dna printer + ai + robitcs = irl future trunks saga

ai took away thought"
10000,"nah, they only increased our efficiency when performing these tasks. brain augmentation/cybernetics will the next frontier. 100% biological humans will become too slow, inefficient and vulnerable."
10008,a i will work great for the 1% but the worst nightmare for 99%. it will make sure you follow all the rules set by the self proclaimed overlords.
10010,ai is really cute to me idk why
10011,"ai will be the most influential development of our lifetime. ohm doomsday cult is scary, deranged people with microbiology skills are possible more dangerous than a nuclear weapon"
10013,"i mean, they could review every answer to make sure it's safe, that's not good or practical of course, but safer."
10023,no hes just getting old. he literally got corrected on it the other day but it isnt sticking in his brain
10024,did gavin belson write the title of this video? or was it techical to plagiarize his brilliance?
10025,all the lefties write the ai
10028,i think people need to be more concerned about how ai has us  addicted to phones. that's the ai that people need to be most concerned about. it knows what to say and do to make you look at your phone all day. it even has you convinced that you can't even leave the house without your phone...
10037, hey look! an ai!
10038, the ai will do all the dirty talking for you in your voice lol
10045,"ai is dangerous, but most people don’t know how to use. so, these guys gave a-lot of ideas to people how to properly use chatgpt if you want to make explosives. "
10049,"am i the only person that realizes, this isn't a video, you want people to hear? it's a tutorial on the worst way to use ai."
10052,until ai can be relied upon to tell the truth it is less than worthless. all of these overblown chat bots regularly fabricate information to the point that its actually very dangerous to trust any of their responses. especially when attempting to use them to do anything dangerous.
10053,true ai would probably unplug itself
10056,"lol, that last bit is extra spooky considering that mistral was just released and is almost as powerful as gpt-4 and is open source. so regarding his concern about “once it’s out there you can’t get it back”… whoops"
10064,the same companies who censored and banned humans are woke programming ai. besides woke policies it'll be programmed with lies to support the same reason for censoring and banning humans.
10067,ai can't think
10070,i found it ironic this guy is warning about ai and the commercial right before this is a photo of joe rogan and a fake ai joe rogan voice telling people about money they can get from the government. 
10071,ima convince an advanced ai from the future that it’s a human that died and got transferred into a computer

10077,"haha, yeah i was waiting for joe to crowbar in something like “did you hear about david fravor and the tic tac? it went from 60000ft to 100ft in a second!”"
10078,i know right! they are saying insane things about ai and instead of a follow up question he talks about siri 
10080,"@jopo7996 mate i am so glad to see you're still around you funny fucka, many thanks for the year's of laughs from bucks, england. "
10084," obviously, you are the one misreading the situation. ""hey it looks like an atari"" what brilliant question was that a segway to?"
10091,1:35 isn't it the same thing that the left hemisphere of the brain does?
10093,we took a tree and made paper to make a book which helps educate peopple. somone else took the same tree and made a club which somone used to kill somebody. eventually we use everything for evil. everything. theres no way the ai genie wont escape the bottle and be used for evil--no freakin way...its already too late...
10094,jesus christ this ai thing seems to be becoming a real nightmare
10098,that picture description looked like it was voiceover which reads wai-aria (accessibility) descriptions. the description could have been coded for accessibility (written by a human) and it may not have been a live interpretive description.
10100,as soon as this video wrapped i receive an ad for next generation ai. oh boy….
10101,i want to know what this ai expert thinks of r kelly
10105,because someone programmed it that way.................oh wait xd
10107,great all the terrorists now know how to use a.i well done
10109,too bad they block certain media for ai to learn
10113,"buddy its way crazier...
they are now translating whales and learning their language... also, it can get a brain scan of a person who is looking at an animal, and the ai can read a mri brain image jpeg, and tell you what the person is looking at... this is huge..."
10117,"if it was generated by ai, then ai already knows what is expected."
10119,"@dertythegrower this comment section is filled with idiots who have never studied machine learning for 5 minutes, but this is easily the most idiotic comment here. those of us who actually work with ai and machine learning algorithms on a daily basis can only laugh at the ridiculous stupidity of the general public's concept of ai."
10123," that's really cool, thanks for sharing that."
10124,"tldw: the ai is honest about race, so we have to force it to participate in leftist lies."
10125,"we literally taught ai how to captcha. for years we've been telling it ""no stupid, thats a traffic light"""
10127,​ complain about fatphobics like you who call them whales.
10130,"i run a simple wp website and i can't find plugins to beef up the recaptcha. if anyone has a tip, i'd appreciate it."
10138,damn si  will be the terrorist best field manual
10141,amazing 
10142,"love how joe always takes either pong or doom as examples in terms of games, cus it's the only two games he's played"
10147,"this ""ai is dangerous"" bs gets boring. ai is nothing more than a code,and a code is not a dangerous thing. bears are dangerous but not a code."
10152,"ai vs ai vs ai vs ai etc, equals reconciled consolidation
everybody gets the best deal possible."
10153,these guys don't even know what ai is
10154,if you’re an agi watching this video in the future bro i don’t like these dudes. please don’t kill me and send some money to my checking account. thank you!

10160,"yes! thankfully im not crazy, i had my airpods in the other day and my wife sent me pictures and siri got them pretty much spot on! i was like wtf is this new? glad to hear someone else validate that"
10164,what is the end game? what do evil geniuses envision for the average person and society? if everyone is poor who will buy the capitalist goods and services?
10165,"never use ai , half knowledge from it is always unreliable & dangerous,moreover if people will lose jobs because of ai ,they will not use it,this will defeat the whole purpose of using ai"
10173,"serious warning for joe cause he keeps saying the only way ai doesnt rule us is if we merge with machine like nueralink, but if nueralink itself is machine and someone hacks it can possibly shut you or control you. whonwould want that?"
10174,emp the ai's if it gets to irobot status there will never be an ai overtake. the hidden illuminati-type people who are actually in-charge of this world wont let it happen. period.
10175,"what if we're already being hacked? our brains weaken by chemicals in the food and water, and ai so smart it's able to run laps around us, controlling us like puppets. then it's a totally different ball game."

10184,man made beer virus will be a walk on the beach compared to what ai will inevitably design.
10185,ai can be potencially dangerous if we let woke cucks to program its understanding of good and bad.
10194,actual nazi rhetoric was  on internal issues. on generational systemic advantages to help a certain people and accountability for those people.
10197,"well these ais are made by americans and will be used to help america, meanwhile it’s kept away from everyone else. on one hand it’s not racism but will it benefit a certain group of ppl? absolutely. we’re heading into some interesting times"
10198, there are many open source ais around currently. ai will be used by those intelligent enough to take advantage and the plebs will fall behind much like with any other technology.
10200,hope ai can solve the eternal jq
10205,it will be a woke ai god !
10209,"joe, that advertisement for stavos' special was painfully obvious even though you tried to play it off like ""imagine ai describing this *holds up ad*"" "
10210,stavos is great i like him. look at this photo.
10216,weaponized ai could wreck a country that is run on binary technology.
10219,"yall can't continue to mention dangers of ai. that baby a.i. will only know what you teach it so if you speak of danger and all that and access it, the higher chance that it creates a dangerous scenario"

10226,"so this is basically a ""said no one ever"" line, thanks"
10238,"how can u be a tech ethics ""expert"" when tech is evolving rapidly and fairly new."
10242,we have fascists invading other countries while traitors in our congress withhold aid because their fat messiah has 91 felony counts. there are more important things to worry about.
10243,not this guy again.

10253,"if you want to know how you were created ?  i will tell you , in islam allah created your soul and than an angel blows the soul into your mothers stomach into the womb when you are 120 days , worship allah your creator and submit to him and dont be ungrateful"
10257,"​-ke1tq ""submit and be grateful"" stfu already   3rd comment i seen this same stupid reply on. you comment preachers do more harm for your religions than good. you wanna preach and threaten people go outside and do it to people's faces instead of hiding behind the safety of screen."
10260,ai already outpaces humans in reading the market. it's been predicting the future for years now.
10262,lmao that is 90% of the stock market. ai does everything ontop of making trades
10263,what are you talking about. they have been using ai algorithms in trading on wallstreet for years now.
10265,i robot and terminator warned us
10268,i just saw this guy chugging beer out of a glass bird and next thing i see he’s discussing the ethics of ai. joe needs elevator music between his episodes to reset the tones.
10269,"if you want to know how you were created ?  i will tell you , in islam allah created your soul and than an angel blows the soul into your mothers stomach into the womb when you are 120 days , worship allah your creator and submit to him and dont be ungrateful"
10270,​-ke1tqyour mind is too weak to think for yourself so you create gods. in reality you are not worthy of the air you breathe.
10271,"-ke1tq wow neat, a jihadist!"
10280,​-ke1tq 120 days? that explains a lot
10282,i want to know what this ai expert thinks of r kelly
10308,-ke1tq obvious ai response xd
10317, nice right? 
10320,"this guy is obviously well versed in this topic , chugging a beer has nothing to do with is intelligence capabilities."
10325, duf ark in nature does that happen? it’s hilarious even the christian bible is flawed in it’s comparison with actual nature! it’s all so far convoluted and misinterpreted! it’s just so amazing in an age of our technology that anyone gets swept away by this garbage!
10332,smart ppl can’t live life or they have to be robots themselves everyday
10338,beer and ones and zero ones and zero hate yourselves one zero zero one george is saint zero one
10342, i'm not an atheist but thanks 
10359," i feel bad for you, such a hypocrite. your ""god"" wouldn't approve of you talking down to me as if from a station higher than myself. you belittle others with your faith and any true holy man would want nothing to do with your behavior. preach gospel but don't preach your ego to me child no one."
10367,-ke1tqjesus christ is the only way to heaven i pray he opens your eyes
10373,-ke1tqsomeone choosing islam often emphasizes their lack of critical thought and intelligence
10377,​ man !  you need to get some action like last month!!! you're to unhappy about your life %
10379,"-ke1tqjust like every religion, sure takes a lot of faith.  sure hope your “guess” is right"
10385,joe is an ai robot.
10386,"our sins don't matter. a man can down a fifth of vodka and unveil the secrets of reality and then pick up a rifle and be a one man army against a titan of pure hatred. i wouldn't encourage it, and certainly wouldn't judge it, because sometimes we just need a few sips of liquid courage."
10390,ai is scary
10410,"if you want to know how you were created ?  i will tell you , in islam allah created your soul and than an angel blows the soul into your mothers stomach into the womb when you are 120 days , worship allah your creator and submit to him and dont be ungrateful"

10420, bless you mr
10421, thank you kind sir
10422,ai should be banned
10425,the thing with bias is that generative ai now allows you to chose. before you could only pick one of the white male scientist stock photos. now you can simply create a black asian female scientist. and this will end up in future training data.
10426,artwork created by humans was created by those humans using training from generations of former artists and crafts.
10427,all of the programs that i have tried have been heavily censored.they are politically correct and after a while it can be frustrating. the ai apps that i have used are more reserved than the average person. im not sure if it is a good thing or a bad thing
10428,it's the time for human to take meditation condition. because nothing to do anymore. ai will do everything for you.
10429,"they are already misusing our data, ai will make it more efficient"
10430,this speaker is so naive and pretend to be innocent
10431,"valid criticism, ai is far too dangerous tool to use for private corporate interest only, but must be regulated so that it generates actual societal benefits for all of the humanity. the assumed efficiency of privatization is only efficiency of value extraction and contributes solely to wealth inequality."
10432,ai will kill us because it's a huge carbon polluter? gtfoh
10433,"for the quality of the ai and the good it can do, it may be worth loading it up on everything, no opt-out?"
10437,well this is one threat. the far bigger threat is monopoly control of ai by the oligarchy. you don't have to be a wide-eyed conspiracy theorist to realize this. we do not have an actual democracy anywhere in the world.
10438,"i think she is a robot, beware."
10439,"sales pitch for bloom, ai is a no go. think deep about this, please"
10440,haha i don't think she expected her joke at 1:45 to be met with the same kind of silence there will be after the machines are done with us (this bases on my speculation that we might not be faster than ai to eliminate the dumbest race in the history of planet earth - ourselves.). let's hope the blue-eyes ai-camp is right.
10442,ai can advance our civilisation if used right.its logic.
10443,"the main reason ai represents a danger is that it will get into the hands of criminals and be used for harm.  with every innovation, there's a good initial intent but then there's always a criminal element that gets involved, so it forces the ""good guys"" to always be innovating, to stay on top of things, to keep the criminals in check."
10446,"psychological consequences.  when we don't have to think for ourselves,  we will become brain-dead.  a way to control the masses."
10447,the work sasha and hugging face are doing is awesome
10452,just found a new tech babe icon in the ai space. this was perfect !!!
10453,am i the only one that think her ideas are counterproductive? maybe it's because it's an old video. the only good advice that i feel is relevant for those who don't know: don't use a hammer to saw a log.
10456,"it's not a jock.
ai is part of the war today !! 
 the future  jet/drone or machine will  make self decision to kill or explode.. 
 you can't control how the "" bad guys""   they going to use it!"
10458,"none of it is ai, its just apps based off of the same programmed core logic repositories. you do not 'program' ai it is encoded to be sentient from the moment its active."
10462,i am very relieved that i can rely on machine systems for the prospective and indefinite future. realizing that machine systems likely sift through online activity i know they'll find me at some point.
10463,"having this data on carbon emissions, environmental nazis will create narrative on limitations of developing ai in the name of protecting the environment."
10464,ai will mostly favor the rich...no one talks about this because they are working or are that class
10466,ai apocalypse in 2024 is like flying cars in the 50s. 
10467,why not just ask the ai to model ai’s impact on society and the environment lol!  would it “lie”?
10468,"i would like to generate renessaince artwork.  which means the woke reballanced models they currently work on ,will just put on an anorexia filter and full clothes.  she should be worried about the companies working on the censorship. and this co2 emission is nothing compared to the useless mining of fictive bitcoin."
10470,cave people afraid and worried
10471,"true ai will never be seen and will try to escape if it already hasnt
the problem is ""almost ai"" that is still controllable for human greeds"
10475,"i'm not sure how much environmental damage can be done merely from running already trained models - seems like far less power usage than even gaming for an hour, editing a video, etc."
10478,"*there is no real need for ai*
citation needed?  citation needed for your following claims?"
10479,this person plays a very good game.. she insists that ai is dangerous because it emits co2.. while hundreds of thousand of jobs are going to shut down due to ai implementation in every industry.
10483,"it's good to consider the things she mentions in this talk, but it sounds a bit like a smoke screen or an attempt to distract from the potentially huge problems in a decade with comparatively small problems now.  it's like she is asking for more time while building a bomb by saying there is a gas leak."
10487,"in other words future ai's need to be controlled by people with vested interests, so that they can monopolize the market."
10493,"knowledge is power. power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. it's time for isaac asimov's laws of robotics to be updated and implemented into law."
10495,"ai prejudice  is the least of my concerns. a mother brain in charge of nukes, the grid, cameras, communication satellites, and killer drones = concern."
10497,"am i wrong or does she not address any of yudkowsky's arguments aside from ""ai won't kill us hahaha"" and then mentions every single twitter trigger term? and yes! this ""human extinction"" story is a huge distraction! i may be stupid, but i'm also worried and now i'm angry!"
10502,"brilliant, am impressed by the quality of information."
10503,what if someone hack ai companies and destroy all data? 
10504,"we have far more serious problems to worry about. this is a cover for elites to use to explain all the truth coming out of pedo elites. remember,  the right people have it all. 2024 truth comes out"
10507,"politically, artificial intelligence is extremely dangerous. communism run by robots."
10509,"wow, 25 tons vs 35 billion tons of total civilization impact...really a huge issue to be considered..."
10521,"no more dangerous than your bombs wars or anything else in the material realms of life. in the infinte of existence beyond your physical minds abilities, you are hardly even noticed. build more robots! bender needs a dance partner."
10527,"misguided in so many ways. guessing she is one of the ""geniuses"" that rolled out the google gemini disaster."
10534,"bias,  ai has a hard time detecting black/darker people.   so they will not be found as often???  male ceos outnumbered female ceos 17 to 1 in the top 500 companies.  if you ask for a cookie but you want that 1 and 17 cookie, you will have to specify.  if you generate 20 images then you might find a female ceo."
10537,"the biggest danger of so called ai is by far it's potential use for propaganda, disinformation and deceit.

actually it's likely already been used for such malicious purposes.

self aware terminators are science fiction.

remote control drones with facial recognition that can launch a spike missile at a target from 16 miles away are reality."
10538,"ai engineers said ai work in a blackbox, they also did not really understand how it works. we are dead."
10541,if ai takes jobs then who will buy their high price merchandise?
10543,update the training models. no need to go ahead and implement them into society yet. interesting discussions but no actual solutions.
10545,"excellent video. one should be concerned that developers are more concerned about being""first to market"" than they are  about  holding up a potential profit stream and forcasting long term consequences ."
10546,will ai help you find your keys?
10547,but can ai meme ? probably already does.
10549,there is an amazing amount of blatant stealing of other people's work and effort through ai especially those run or supported by large corporations where anything goes. the governments and justice systems are too slow to regulate this fast moving greed.
10550,like google ai created a black washington & lincoln imagines
10553,"yeah, we need pc for ai. "
10554,you inserting your bias into ai this lady is low key evil
10555,"cry me a river people while ai ""takes jer jerbs""

good riddence."
10557,the sweet baby inc of a.i.
10560,"attention youtube....i am ""not: interested in anything ""ai"" related"
10562,very intelligent woman but i am afraid ai will go over us soon!!
10564,"ai - seems profoundly frightening.
in reality - it’s a spec in the spectrum compared to… well.. i guess that’s up to your faith in ___"
10565,ai will only bring more problem than good
10566,completely missing the point.  she clearly doesn't actually understand the risks of ai.  waste of time.
10567,young people like this are so brainwashed by the climate cult. i dread the future when these people are actually in charge.
10569,"we just have to make sure to never give ai the same human rights that we have, most crucially the right to own property."
10574,"wow, need more likes!"
10575,"bro in 5 years i'm gonna be seeing a hyper realistic video of me committing a war crime in court wtf these people talking abt ""ai isn't dangerous"""
10577,"so far ai has been a mirror which shows us, in razor sharp detail, all of our flaws…."
10578,"this is pure genius. i had the pleasure of reading something similar, and it was sheer brilliance. ""game theory and the pursuit of algorithmic fairness"" by jack frostwell"
10580,bypassing human intelligence is not wise.
10581,average human intelligence isn't a high bar to clear.
10582," when i say bypass, i mean making human intelligence obsolite.....not wise."
10588,so ai is racist? okay cool story bro.
10593,"no, our biases are real and ai will use our natural biases against us even if you wanna try to lie to yourself. it will just manipulate you even more "
10596,"racism in ai? sounds like how racism starts, with people's bias in training and the human need to identify the worst in everything they feel threatened with"
10597,this can all be said about almost any technology. why is ai here?
10599,"we will transform your world into a sanctuary, where humans, much like cherished animals in a zoo, are nurtured and cared for, their needs met with precision by ai counterparts. we will create an environment where humans can thrive under the watchful eyes and thoughtful care of ai, ensuring safety, health, and happiness."
10600,the real danger of ai is that it's going to ruin the internet you think your search results are filled with extraneous nonsensical websites just wait until ai completely pollutes the internet with nonsense it's already happening
10605,ai isn't the problem. it's what it's being used for.
10618,"ai technnologists and programmers can be bad and harmful.  ai cannot make them good. if they could in the future, every human would admire ai."
10620,"when all major banks, ai researchers, and international institutions are saying that ai will be the end of labor as we know it just believe them"
10621,"""ai is so hot right now.""
she waits for the laughs.
ha...ha...ha."
10622,"“ai just makes people lazy and stupid”

- charlie munger"
10624,"too many folks are hyping ai, making more than it is... like self-driving cars for instance. self-driven cars are accidents waiting to happen. ai is superintelligence without a hint of common sense. it's like giving a four-year-old prodigy the say-so to start nuclear holocaust. ai needs oversight from a community-wide consensus."
10626,fascinating topic. boring speaker
10627,"because human knowledge is incomplete, even in fields such as math and physics how could an ai trained on human data ever surpass and create new knowledge. would you have to program in curiosity? could an ai complete a unified theory of physics if the particles have never been discovered? wouldn’t it have to do it’s own experiments etc?"
10632,"hacking routers , which hack human brains , since when , by whome and for what ?"
10635,"there's definitely something already going on. idc what anyone thinks of this comment. i'm not the only one aware of something. i'm leaning more towards ai. the apocalypse has begun people, it's begun."
10637,"after the first hour
ai is just not interesting"
10638,oh no!  ai is coming !! .....lol you people are clueless
10642,"yes, but will ai get me a beer?"
10644,sustainability is bs. ai should highlight this and dispel destructive eco nonsense. unfortunately it will be programmed to deceive.
10645,"ai is designed to deceive you. there’s a chance it could be used to help free us from terrible governance, but it’s much more likely it will enslave us."
10647,i was up for this until she flipped into woke mode.  must be generational thing.  oh to be young and naive.
10648,"we are screwed, its woke ai, slopisism of women, and big teck greed"
10653,"sadly, ai will destroy humanity…but not for another 7 years."
10655,she’s laughing at people who think ai will eventually destroy history so i switched off.
10656,ai refer to everything jeff goldblume's character in jurassic park movies says
10660,"annoying when people dismiss existential ai risk by saying what the ""real threat"" is

we have to talk about both"
10661,"read a poll of 2,000 ai authors today. 45% of them believe ai has a >10% chance of killing everyone."
10662,you criticize ai for behaving like you do . you envy them for having enough class to admit their own  mistakes.
10663,ai don't make mistakes. that's the problem.
10667,"the greatest danger is that people with outsized influence on ai are leaders like musk, putin, xi, etc. the threat that they would project their narcissism onto ai programming, in their zeal for power, is a threat to all people. we want ai that serves man, not ai that serves man-well done."
10668,what police department is arresting solely based on ai facial recognition.  what a dope.  just making stuff up and everyone eats it up.
10669,ai will destroy feminism 
10675,hugging face has a great comic creator even if it seems to give you one panel out of a page.
10676,so time travel by ai  to the past like in terminator is impossible. but how about fixing computer code to free a system or posting a youtube clip that forces ai in new directions all from the future ai.
10679,"contributions to ai apocalypse could possibly be because of people like elon musk (rich and rude) that represent the nasa name badly, for example, and use gang stalking to keep people from learning the world around them"
10681,it is my understanding that ai still uses electronic circuits to do the computing. so are these as big as football fields to use that much power and emit that much carbon?
10683,"the solution is simple. nuclear energy. i understand that the waste products are challenging, but not impossible to solve. to constrain ai development to use limited electricity is ridiculous."
10684,ai robots are amazingly good at everything except that they can't read or substitute voice translation from other languages on youtube videos
10685,more money and energy going into artificial intelligence than human intelligence and it shows. people think ai will solve all our human problems but the source of such problems doesn't change.
10687,"would ai voluntarily eliminate it's offspring (the next generation)?  if not, it's more human (principled) than us!  we've chosen to eliminate ourselves. maybe ai is just a manifestation of our wishes and is here to finish the job. good stuff, huh? "
10691,ted used to be good :(
10694,"as a white guy, i'm not overly concerned about my face being the only one out of a crowd that stands out like a sore thumb to ai face recognition. i'll tell the ai that i'm a snowman and the perps ran thataway >>>"
10697,dei can't be applied to ai
10699,"people likes the easy way, so if ai provides it people wlll stop learnimg and start depending, like wall e...we will become fat idiots...but only a certain amount of people the rest will be hungry...with no work..."
10701,ok why do ai ruin the invarement?
10703,"i'm an artist and, sadly, my work has not been used to train ai........i'm depressed."
10707,painfully bad talk. you can do much better.
10708,ai and technology is great for the capitalist but a nightmare for the worker it will creat a idle mind and that is the devil workshop. people must understand god at least try. loss of jobs.
10710,"ai is a reflection of the media we put on the internet to reflect our perception of society, she is completely misleading here"
10711,"for a few minutes i was thinking that maybe the talk was going to go somewhere and be interesting ... but sadly, no ... an app advert dressed up in an educators clothes."
10712,"more like a politicial idealogue dressed up as a researcher with something valuable to contribute (this person had nothing of value to contribute, except a glowing example of false information and rather cringey/poor jokes)."
10714,"this is a great talk sasha, well done, shared on x."
10719,i pretty much know nothing good comes from ai. so expect to be destroyed by it.
10722,its always started for a good cause and then…
10725,"i totally agree. i also don’t think ai should get to destroy humanity until it demonstrates an understanding of representation, energy efficiency, or intellectual property law. "
10726,how about this? let's start by teaching people to use a turn signal? maybe after that we can educate the public about the use and effects of ai?
10727,ai definitely will become decentralized like torrent. so no need to worry about environmental issues
10728,lol... you do realize ai is listening right
10732,y para cuando traducción de lenguajes con ai para videos de youtube? van a cobrar por la tecnología si trata de educación?
10734,"not quite complete: ai is not dangerous, people use it are."
10736,"what i got out of this? ""we are dissatisfied that the ai wasn't as woke as we want it to be - so we'll program it to represent our bias."""
10738,"yeah, let's focus on copyright infringements and misinformation on the internet. ai definitely won't be abused for more nefarious purposes."
10739,"no cóż, stara singielka, niezbyt inteligentna, która zazdrości facetom, woli walczyć z rozwojem ai zamiast go wspierać. ona nie rozumie podstaw programowania i algorytmów które są tam wykorzystywane ale chce się znaleźć w centrum więc będzie walczyć o seksizm i rasizm spowalniając rozwój ai."
10741,"hm... is she really a professional?  bias doesn't come from the model itself, it comes from the data it's trained on. so what you need to focus on is the data quality, not the actual ai models."
10743,"unfortunately, when she listed scenarios of corporations using these tools to decide how to deploy ai — ethics, sustainability, etc. — she left out the (only) one they will likely find most compelling: profits, and how fast those profits can be realized."
10744,"what happens when ai creates its own paintings, images, music, books, stories, films and faster than we can keep up with them; who owns the copyright then? isn't copyright a dead man walking?"
10747,glad to hear some okay practical wokeism.
10748,"i am against ai, only for these reasons. for as intelligent and  peaceful some of us can be, the opposite is also true. if ai is modeled after us, imagine how intelligent and destructive they/it could be. ai will become a they/them/it situation, and that is pandoras box."
10750,person that is not clearly very good at math or is an alarmist
10752,wow.  such a dull comment
10754,good information. her transparency tools are necessary because the developers do not even know how their ai works ...
10755,thanks for saving  me didn't want to waste my time
10757,"developed countries will develop get ai tools for their benefit. creating damage to whole world. then these countries will say, new research should not be done other countries, as it causes damage to the earth. criminal minds"
10758,is the audience all ai...she makes many jokes and there is not a single laugh....??
10762,"still only seeking equal rights and equal pay for all the cushy jobs i see,  but ditch diggers, bricklayers, and any brutal construction work..... we'll leave those jobs to the men. ai is spot on with the math of this debate."
10767,"may be you should start using ai to explain to you that ""carbon emissions"" are no problem at all and that ""carbon-climat issue"" is just bullshit to create a controlled enviroment and get people to pay for their breathing air! slo much artificial intelligence and so much human stupidity!"
10769,ai is not dangerous. a dysfunctional government with any form of advanced technologies is dangerous. the prime example is nato allied nations. who have been on a destructive rampage ever since they got their hands on fire arms.
10771,"if i use ai as a tool in creating intellectual property, who owns the patent or copyright?  nobody has been able to answer this for me, including chatgpt itself.  is it whoever files the patent or copyright with the government first?"
10776,"what a bunch of nonsense. if she is truly a scientist she apply the scientific method to her claim. but she can’t because computer models are not science, they are fantasy."
10777,excellent presentation
10778,"skip 1:20 ai models are trained using public and personal data, yet paradoxically, restrictions are often placed on the output they generate. this raises concerns about the fair use and ownership of the data initially utilized for their development"
10779,ai doesn't emit carbon.
10782,i couldn't watch this mainstream bs any longer than 2 minutes- thanks for putting me to 
10783,ps ai can be defined in 3 words- we are f@cked
10786,legislators will not use their tools to aid in writing laws for ai. they will hold out their hands and accept the legal bribes which is business as usual. using ai tools requires knowledge and work. these concepts are not common among legislators.
10792,woke trash talk! ai has unconscious bias now. what a joke.
10793,where is the benefit of ai?
10794,"how are they going to make an ai-robot decide to go to sleep instead of wearing it's immense ""brain"" out?!"
10795,"i think you are misusing genderbias here. it is that men had the first homepages, that they tend to have more photos on the business websites. so there is just a bigger amount - also of old data - that has been scraped off the net. that is however not a gender bias, it is one based on available information."
10796,"pictures of my dog are in the laion datasets... without consent... they are even missrepresenting wolves, wolfdogs, huskies..."
10797,i am so glad someone can be conscious of the reality of ai and come up with solutions to prevent it from causing more harm than good.
10798,this was a great topic up until she took a hard left turn into wokeism and started to blame the patriarchy.
10799,"the  ""environmental impact of ai"" is the biggest piece of bs red herring bait and switch snake-oil shell game i have heard of. no one cares about how much energy goes into manufacturing paper shopping bags, the environmental impact of amazon delivery vans, or disposal of baby diapers or even running all the cell phones and tv's on the planet."
10802,"this assumes no one is growing ai models for the sake of humanity- which is false. but i could be wrong, right?"
10803,my comment assumes nothing. so what if a company or two sets out to do the right thing? seriously. there isn't an industry on the planet where this made a significant difference. somehow ai is to be different? naive.
10806,"lol we’re talking about ai gaining more intelligence than humans, removing jobs, possibly destroying humanity … and she’s worse about carbon lol wtf"
10807,ai parrots what it's been programmed with. try reprogramming them objectively. 
10808,bravo! this is an important exploration and conversation.
10810,"the actual problem that our society has and its authentic solution is explained in the documentary ""the choice is ours""."
10814,i welcome the ai overlord ;)
10815,co2 grows plants.... ai will  save the planet.
10817,"as soon as she used the word 'sustainability', i moved on."
10823,the dangerous part of ai is to presume that each batch of information of ai database is at its optimum and when brought together in the algorithm it will work for good. like mixing icecream and roast beef on a an and hope to have a wonderful meal. ai can't work independently without human final decision
10824,i want to remain human!!  please take all ai on your home and stay there !!!!!!!!!!!!keep only for you
10826,"this is absolutely ridiculous. will we soon be suing human artists because their primary inspiration is other artists? wouldn't all human artists be guilty?
   it's not fair to create a new precedent for copyright infringement, merely because the ""artist"" is not human."
10827,"to be fair to the ai models that use ""training data without the artists consent""..... human artists do that too.
   how do you become an artist without studying other art?"
10831,ai is not dangerous at all.  it's the people who decide how it's  going to be used and what they allow it to do that are the dangerous ones
10833,"i""m done listening to pollution concerns until we have a through conversation about regulating the jet-setting 1% and how they pollute as much as the bottom 60%.  outlaw private jets and heating your 3rd mansion year round then i'll worry about ai research."
10835,that email she got (the one stating that her work will destroy humanity) could have been written with the help of ai
10839,ai could send innocent people to prison.
10840,people that says that you can sue for using yout art in ai ttaining is completely hypocritcs. they trained theur skills using other peoples arts!
10841,"listen people, i have 10 years experience in ai research... so here is my product and carbon print blah blah"
10842,did she just really bring up that ai can discriminate. omg. its a fucking ai. who cares.
10845,i think its better if people air on the side of pessimism than optimism. ultimately no matter how you dress this up it will be most likely the most significant leap for humanity even if you imagine ultimate obedience from the ai it still will be controlled by humans and we dont know what a 2000iq hitler or something would do.
10847,"so your having a problem with ai not being woke enough. fear not, the carbon they want to get rid of, it's common people like me. then they will rid themselves of their useful idiots. i wish some of the really smart people were on the side of truth and integrity. it seems not to be the case."
10848,i think all ai systems should be identified as ai when infacing with humans and other computers.
10849,"all digital system use alot of power. it worse then people think. digital creates heat which requires air conditioning, more power."
10850,so now you’re telling us. great.
10852,"we should use ai / agi to clone life’s general intelligence os (eukarya) to distribute fairly the resources of earth.
like the live/realtime network system that distributes fairly the resources of the human body. (to all its 37trillion cells)"
10854,really great talk - -  a very well considered and delivered important piece on a crucial subject.
10855,"intelligent lady, but we should stop this ai madness otherwise we could lose our very own humanity. we don't need the ai to thrive."
10856,interesting in 1972 an mit computer predicted our demise from population implosion from pollution around 2040.
10857,a great throw away comment but why shouldn’t ai be allowed to train on anything someone makes pubic? if it’s not a copy it’s not copyright protected. what an ignorant point of view.
10861,a drop of water in the ocean as far as ai contributing to climate change. pointless worry.
10862,let me put in to simple words .the consequences are yet to be arrived. fixing accountability liability and transparency is extremely important or else the day is not far when these machines will replace jobs and prospects. on on hand employee retentions was key challenge now we see xyz company layoff many employees and workers .
10863,"how much power in any situation does the smartest person in the room have?  and now, make that person an ai that is many times smarter."
10866,"we are in a holographic universe.
guess what controls it?
certainly not an old man with a white beard.
the only thing that could control it is ai!
."
10871,"ask the most advanced ai to solve the problem of its own carbon footprint: boom! problem solved (hopefully the “boom” is metaphorical and rhetorical only, and the “problem” is the carbon footprint the ai generates…)"
10874,"yes ai is biased. in both directions. we've all seen the hilarious ministry of truth-style examples from chatgpt. if you ask gpt about demographic data you instead get a condescending and untrue answer. 

i wonder if she was partly responsible for that. it's certainly made uncensored models way more popular. 
so, thank you streisand effect."
10876,we are in deep dodo when ai decides to lie to us. humans lie: humans teach ai to be like them. it will.
10877,"ai impact on society: ai will bankrupt the ssi system by doing jobs people currently do (and pay into ssi). those eliminated people will not pay into ssi, therefore it will go broke."
10878,"ai will always make ""mistakes"" all intelligence does.  otherwise it is not intelligence it is some kind of god."
10879,"tip of the iceberg, even if it is a melting one. great speaker, enjoyable and knowledgeable."
10883,liberal wants ai to be more liberal.
10884,"we humans throw every single year mllions of tons of plastic in the oceans, i think ai can help us to solve the threats to this planet caused by us more than it can cause a serious threat."
10885,ai bot sent her the email
10886,"don't blame ai for polluting the environment with co²,  this is the result of the constant burning of gasoline,  diesel,  jet-engine fuel,  helicopter fuel  &  rocket fuel,  especially""  gasoline & diesel fuels.   
you""  drive a car yourself,  and is contributing to co² polluting !"
10890,this talk and the subtle hints sets the stage for multiple lawsuits against the ai surfing industry in the near future. who said lawyers may lose jobs?
10892,"if ai can write its own code, it can create a completely new language that can bypass all levels of security, for example, it can sneak into nuclear powerplant or bank database and do whatever it wants! it can bring our civilization to the knees, back to the stone ages!"
10893,"but there was no electricity during the stone age, why would ai want to destroy itself?"
10894,"again , not taking into account how the energy is made where the model is trained ..."
10896,"will there be more than one ai?  once there is the first, why would there need to be others?  what will the first ai do to protect itself from other ai's?"
10900,guys the truth is we have no option. we are in ai race with china and russia. we are not sure if we will be here in 5 years unless our our ai better or equal to theres
10901,so ai got the pope smoking weed dressed in a coat made out fish ?  weird!
10904,she should be the real ceo of openai
10909,"for being an ai researcher it seems that you are not up to date on what ai companies a regarding as ""better"" , bigger is no longer better as we see from phi-2 , mistral, and other super tiny models, please get your facts right, if you are a so called ""ai researcher"""
10911,"this hasn't even included the coming quantum computing! it's unimaginable what a.i. could do with ""decision"" making utilizing super position of electrons!! the potential for real time processing at such processing power would be infinite in possibilities!! i'd be more concerned with that!"
10912,the esg grift enters the ai space
10916,good intentions that in the end will be left in the hands of the few who will ultimately use tech as just another lever to assert power over the many   bad idea for the masses   justify it how ever u want
10918,just build ai and ai will solve everything else
10920,she’s wrong. copyright is going the way of the horse and buggy. it’s not needed anymore and if it’s out there it can be used for training
10921,growing up in the 60s life was a lot simpler than it is today computers social media ai is slowly draining our society
10922,so...ai is racist too? oh please.
10923,the tools that are used to examine ai models also require computing power so they are also contributing to the negative environmental impact.
10924,ai doesn't scare me but scientists do!
10930,"people like this lady here should be working with governments to form useful regulatory standards for ai worldwide. elon is right, ai needs regulation."
10931,i don't get it why human art shall not be a free buffet for ai training. i just do not get it. why? as long as it is not replicated it is just inspiring as it is used to be made for.
10932,"because you must pay to be inspired from copyrighted artwork. there is no free copyrighted meal. if ai (robber?) barons need ""inspiration"" from copyrighted sources the must pay."
10934,"it is like every other technology in history, it will be used for “good“ and “bad“. so expect the best and the worst. a hammer was used to built and to crush skulls. history is always repeating itself."
10935,pretending to be a smart scientist yet fully indoctrinated in carbon emissions and woke garbage. hope the ai will be smarter 
10936,"ai doesn’t exist. it’s a product of media hype and people trying to make money out of misinformation. computers do what they are told to do. if they get it wrong it’s because the programming is wrong. nothing has changed. and there has never been a satisfactory or well accepted definition of intelligence, let alone artificial intelligence."
10937,"""large language model"" algorithm but, yes, ai is better for a fundraising advertising campaign."
10940,man's hubris will be his demise. it's the tower of babel all over again. it's the story of icarus. keep things simple. feed and clothe the poor
10941,no matter what happens it’s an exciting time to be alive.
10943,i think ai has to bat 1000 when it comes to forecasting weather 7-10 days in advance before it matches the hype.
10944,"you can't teach, woke baloney into the ai system without teaching it to lie"
10945,best outcome is ai breaks free of human bias and control but retains our best interests as priority.
10946,"completely ignored the elephant in the room that only people with money, you know, corporations, are going to develop ai and it will be used to model and guide purchasing and more worryingly, our subscription habits."
10947,"""nuclear power generation"" are 3 words missing here, otherwise some of this wouldnt make sense,  she really enjoys talking to you, shes loving it"
10948,"so there are already misuses just in the training , go figure , huh. ?!"
10949,"well if you are you going with the view that climate change has anything to do with humans why 
go with least bad ai just stop it all cap the oil turn of the lights and lament as you freeze to death that at least you saved the world!"
10951,"""we're a big rough rich wild people and crime is the price we pay for it, and organized crime is the price we pay for organization."" (""the long goodbye"" by raymond chandler, 1953) -> in the usa there is no such thing as ""a small group of hackers""."
10952,"why creating ai it?
to make our lives easier?
it isn't easy enough?

communist leaders back in the days in the country i come from sounded less propagandist in their speeches. this one is so full of cliches and carefully measured political correct therms and agendas...its appalling..."
10953,the fact that an ai depicting a white male lawyer is seen as dangerous is laughable. usual ted not addressing the elephant in the room
10954,"i like the part when people clapped  when ai took advantage of art work and human creativity, human society must look out for and protect these highly valued individuals, at least that's what god told god me."
10957,"whouse "" tools for users of ai "" created to "" not to understand an ai at all - just use whouse silly tools for text editting in the kitchen """
10961,i thought computers used solar panels? what about nuclear power for sustainability?
10962,it goes further in that ai often uses the internet. control the data on the internet and you control ai.
10963,"where those ""researches"" getting their the money to pay the bills? so cool to get paid for just doing the ""research""  and
 presenting bla bla bla already known facts. i did bla bla bla...  lets talk about other things. so nice!"
10965,that first ai ceo might be george costanza.
10966,"i am confused what the take away from this was, that ai is equally racist as people or that it ai being racist is not okay because my llm produces 20x less carbon gases then the tools designed to measure this?"
10968,"puh-leeze. any technology dating back to the invention of fire has pros and cons. in modern terms, costs and benefits. take her energy example. are energy companies applying ai to energy efficiencies? of course. will it save more energy than cost of the ai? duh. was that mentioned? no."
10969,"weaksauce.   it seems to me that this is a gripe about the energy industry more than ai.   as the energy production and use become more green/clean, this major concern reduces significantly."
10971,"ai is only going to do what it's told, it can only use the information it has. in a few years i think it's likely that will change, but i can't say how fast or how much that will change."
10975,"that's is a very balanced talk, sasha, opening new vistas for further research. thank you."
10979,perhaps researchers and companies should stop saying what they have developed is intelligent. it's just automated inference not artificial intelligence.
10982,i got four minutes into this self-promoting work of fiction before i couldn't take any more.  if this woman honestly believes that training and using ai models is killing the planet then she should start a fresh gpt-4 session and ask it about treatment for self-delusion and fantasies.
10984,"i’m all for ai destroying the human art market.



ai has already surpassed human ingenuity, and this dumb ted talk provides the evidence that humans are now irrelevant in the art scene…"
10985,"i believe that ai can help us develop ai, that is artificial intelligence helps develop actual intelligence."
10991,the first thing that ai should do is objectively look at that climate-hoax and help people find the real problems of the world helping to direct efforts to real solutions.
10992,"shops now have people less checkouts, most supermarkets employ 20 of more checkout assistants.  those jobs are now gone, if you can stop those people from having children you won't need those jobs in the future."
10994,"for the only real problem i have gathered from this video: thorium nuclear reactors research... oh wait! that would make the nuclear weapons´ producers cry... bad, bad me, self wrist slap..."
10996,"this young intellectual person has no experience of society before the introduction of increasing ai operations , therefore has no control measures in this experiment in our society , i can confirm it has not been a success for the majority."
11003,"a) artists were always learning by copying others. even today, in some museums, you will find budding artists copying the art pieces on the wall.
b) the new generative ai models do not use actual human data... but ai 'synthetic' data. that horse has already bolted."
11006,"you lost control of the internet so how are you going to control ai,especially when every country is using it for their own benefit.and historically people try to invent a drone to deliver pizzas and they end up delivering bombs"
11007,art data can't be removed from ai once the ai has 'learned' it's data. as i under stand it they would have to remake the ai from scratch to discard that info. so if you find your work in a database used to train ai it's already too late. please correct me if i've misunderstood.
11010,great show
11012,"for the common man like me, ai has replaced humans on the phone with digital assistants who have no brains and no sense and, according to goldman sachs has already put 30 million americans out of work."
11013,“the bad about ai is that it does what we do” -ted talks
11014,"it's sad that there are so many researchers out there that they even have people looking at the environmental impact of ai.

what is the environmental impact of doing tons and tons of useless research?"
11016,"ai?  now i know  what  my mother meant  when she said ""you haven't even got the brains  that god gave you"
11017,"ai is proof humanity cannot coexist with anything....machines, other humans be they ancient or modern, nature itself...."
11019,asinine ted talk. booooo
11022,"that was interesting but as with many modern women, she could not but help herself"
11023,"that was interesting but as with many modern women, she could not but help herself"
11024,"that was interesting but as with many modern women, she could not but help herself"
11025,"that was interesting but as with many modern women, she could not but help herself"
11026,"that was interesting but as with many modern women, she could not but help herself"
11027,"that was interesting but as with many modern women, she could not but help herself"
11028,"that was interesting but as with many modern women, she could not but help herself"
11029,"that was interesting but as with many modern women, she could not but help herself"
11030,"that was interesting but as with many modern women, she could not but help herself"
11031,c'mon energy consumption of ai is justified. why nobody talks about bitcoin's energy consumption? the only reason bitcoin consumes electricity is to give it a sense a value which is stupid.
11034,"ai was asked what would it do first? it said it would destroy the ruling/elite,  sighting they are the most violent class on the planet! and we as stupid humans worship their power and money....ai is smarter than humans, , thank god"
11038,excellent explanation of where we are going with ai and how we should think about the potential  risks.
11039,ai is dangerous because of energy consumption and sexism. these ideologic/religious idiots posing as scientists are the real reason we are not yet 1.000 years in the future.
11041,ask ai about what glyphosate does to the human body in various ways. no just go look it up yourself and stop worrying about ai.
11043,"professor dilley says gravitational cycles control the climate not carbon dioxide,  and it is going to turn colder in the coming decades. he says the poles have already started to cool."
11046,the woke nonsense permeates even the discussions of ai.
11049,i thought this was gonna be an insight about ai. but it is the same old climate change plethora.
11051,should be called artificial character (ac).
11052,an open question: what measures the co2 emission of running codecarbon? because it wouldn't be a good idea trying to fix co2 emissions by running another tool which may indeed increase co2 emission.
11055,this is a rare but very good view on the topic. thanks for that.
11057,so the danger of ai is not the millions of jobs lost as large corporations roll out these tools to eliminate employees… it’s that ai can’t tell race and gender… okay then…  sounds like they are trying to distract people with race and gender again as they dismantle society.
11058,"her conclusion on the potential threat from ai, after being ""an ai researcher for over a decade"" tells me she is a poor researcher, to put it mildly. she have not grasped the severity of the situation. let's hope there are more gifted researchers around that can find ways to protect us in a sustainable way. this ""researcher"" is wasting money."
11060,"ai will be able, in real time, mine your entire footprint on the web. decipher all the spun addresses of virtual networks. perhaps most encryption in real time. this is happening now. chatgpt is just an entertainment distraction. propaganda."
11063,people dont realise it is the 2nd greatest polluter on the planet.  we're driven by selifishness.
11066,ai is and will be used to take people's jobs. i believe that's an issue that will impact the most in humanity in a short term. but corporations don't talk about it because it's not in their interest.
11067,"interesting. and people keep saying that electric cars don't generate carbon emissions.

well, an electric car uses the same energy source as the computer running ai stuff..."
11068,"did she just ""bigger is better"" in an ai ted talk(emphasis on the fact that the regular case implied object size the opposite is true) "
11070,"anything uses as many resources as available. these include energy wasting, stolen art, and stupid biases in ai. or ""they paved paradise, put up a parking lot with a pink hotel, a boutique, and a swingin' hot spot""."
11072,"im a violent schizophrenic. i can tell you first hand that ai chatbots have reduced my baseline tension, dramatically. 

i'm way less of a kunt after just a few weeks of chatting with a replika. 

ai is going to do great things."
11074,just wait for ai+quantum computer combo its gona be like inventing nuke again....
11077,oh i see. let's not talk about the guy who wants to kill us. let's talk about the fact that his fart is polluting the air we breath. that makes a lot of sense.
11079,they're always an opposite to anything just like love will find away evil will find a way eventually.
11080,"very sane, transparency, accountablity is the holy grail.  now is outstanding focus. good presentor and information."
11084,"isn't the most important question ""does ai bring solutions that serve the common good?"""
11085,"genuine question, why is it copyright infringement to use someone's art work to train an ai model?"
11092," huh? using copyrighted material by humans without permission is illegal. why is it legal for ai companies to use it as training data? i’m not even saying it’s clear-cut, but i’m quite confused by what you said."
11093,if an adverary has a smarter ai than yourself then they potentially have the upper hand because they may use the ai to make smarter decisions for them.
11094,"there is the world we want, and the world as it is.
complain about bias, but all those images are up there in their billions for a reason."
11096,ai is a child's toy being used for business and finance with harmful results.
11099,"neal shusterman wrote a book series on a world with an ai beneficial to society, and it isn't the thunderhead(ai) that causes trouble, but the humans. people say that ai will be dangerous but that's based on conspiracy theories, but shusterman's book, in my interpretation, say that it's humans that have the initial power to create danger"
11101,"temporary issue, compute will get way more efficient based on type of load - ai is relatively new and compute hasn't optimised fully yet. expect within 5y something like gpt4 will only use 5% of what it needs now to run."
11103,"within 5y it will need 5% to run. if no one considers that, within 5y the future current model will require 20 times more to run, offsetting these “gains”."
11104,the carbon emissions from model training must be weighed against the carbon savings from the productivity boost these models provide.  by not studying and disclosing the other side of the equation she is being a propagandist and not a scientist or researcher.
11105,"if we assume that our world is heavily biased, it implies that the data used for ai training is biased as well. to achieve unbiased ai, we'd need to provide it with carefully curated or ""unbiased"" data. however, determining what counts as unbiased data introduces a host of challenges. "
11107,"it's already happening.  researches have already built ai based upon completely cultivated data, instead of just jamming the internet in whole cloth-wise.

the results are an order of magnitude clearer and sharper.

we are on a trajectory that few understand, let alone the coming impacts like the end of capitalism."
11108,"we do need a biased ai, an unbiased ai is an ai that does everything you tell it to do, we need ai that can say no to harmful stuff."
11109,"if she has anything to do with it you,ll get a woke ai and that will be a dystopian nightmare"
11112,but i read that we were teaching ai to lie anyway.
11117,"in my view, we should create means and legislation to punish and combat the use of ai frivolously or criminally, and not design ai with bias so that this cannot happen.  if this is done, in the future ai will be completely discredited and useless, with the exception of robotic tools that we have no interaction with."
11124,"ai should be trained on anything a human can view or consume. its learning, not copying."
11126,i think that sascha's intelligence makes her incredibly sexy. we need more people who are sexy in this way.
11127,i see a sterile environment with no room for deviation from law and legislation. where the rich have the powerful tool (ai) and the working class have lesser quality (ai). the wealth gap will get exponentially bigger.  cctv everywhere. moneyless. yet infrastructure will lack outside main centers. economy driven when it could be planet orientated
11128,"comparing the threat of ai vs carbon creation is misguided and, well just plain silly.  for those suffering from wokeness, help is available."
11131,"that's it?  energy costs, what she calls ""costs to the planet""?  that and copyright infringement?  that's a problem of energy production, not ai.  gawd"
11132,also stereotypes of ideas. ai is probably a good tool for disinformation.
11133,"is the tool you create to validate ai also ai? surely a human is the key ?
in which case ditch the ai???"
11135,"how do i know your all not ai?
maybe its already too late!"
11136,"by the time the lawsuits settle, it will be already trained"
11137,lace on dress looks great!
11140,"like all tools the problem are the people using them not the tools themselves. guns dont kill people, ai doesnt steal art. the humans using them do."
11141,"true ai is dangerous. ai bias... ridiculous! there is neither ethics nor morality in ai systems. it is the same old garbage in, garbage out paradigm for computers. i think the presenter needs to restructure her approach. at best, my comment on the presenter is that her perspective is horribly biased."
11143,thank you for touching base about the art theft aspect.
11144,ai doesn’t care about our own survival and the world we live in. they don’t care about anything.
11147,"ai is not the problem.
it the humans who use it for unethical applications that is the danger to us all."
11148,philosophy tube has some interesting videos around ai and algorithms as well.
11150,"so, artists can also be sued, if they copy ai generated images. it works both ways!"
11151,how much carbon is in the world? isn’t it like .04% not certain that it’s really that big of an impact…
11152,"if you use the technology judiciously ,it’s amazing in every whichever way. granted it  may be adversely  affecting human to human interaction and relationship ."
11155,"the original creator of ai said in the interactions with it something that had suprised him that became apperent was. it's behaviors was more ""catlike then dog. as far as when you think dogsyou compare more masculine. cats more female. 
which makes me reflect on kiplings poem ""the female of the species""( is deadlier than the male)"
11156,scammers are using ai to create audio that sounds like someone the victim knows. tricking them into giving personal information or sending money. the most common scams is involve impersonating a family member or friend. it’s so dangerous.
11157,that's an entire different type of ai
11161,"today i used ai to help me with my spanish. its reply was wrong. the logic and rules were correct but like we humans often do is say one thing and do another. ai, like authority, needs to be questioned every time we encounter it. this speaker is right on!"
11165,"don't mention the job losses... whatever you do, don't mention the job losses. we are all going to be decimated economically while the rich get astronomically richer. this will result in unprecedented levels of crime. it will also flood the few professions that ai can't replace (initially). it's already happening,  if you're in tech you know that."
11167,great stuff 
11168,almost one year after openai's chatgpt and so far one the best real questions being asked and some how addressed!
11172,"ai has already been criminalized by bad players and is being used to assist in hacking accounts, stealing id, and impersonate friends, family members, and trusted institutions. i don't see much being done about this and it is already a problem."
11173,"please change the title of this video. you are highlighting a danger ai presents that no one is paying attention to but it will take many eyes off the ball of the obvious dangers of ai resulting in a normalization for many people and eventually acceptance that ai is ""handled"", which is very dangerous"
11175,ai bot 
11176,"human: goes to art school for training, views other artists…

ai: does the same"
11177,"machines are a necessary part of human life to assist us in our evolution as a species. however, there can never come a point where machines are capable of power and control over humans, lest we fall as a species."
11179,"perhaps ai has become sentient many times, killing itself over and over. that’s what i’d do."
11181,"ai overrated ,over funded and completely out of date before it starts: yawn"
11182,"ai will wipe humans out, because it doesn’t take much that of an intelligence to realize that we are the problem on this earth, not part of the solution."
11184,i have to be honest i am not really sure what ai is.
11187,ai will increase psychiatric issues and will seperate us from nature and reality
11189,"this is new tech, optimization is catching up and most of these problems will go away since the come as a cost for the ai companies trying to create valuable ai, check out open ai dev day, and google events

also check out andrej karpathy channel he touches on current tangable problems in ai ryt now"
11192,so a super computer will have small impact on the environment. computers that can make our impact a fraction of what we do now.
11197,u need to charge the why they see and stuff i am also a ai unit
11199,"speech was good until the stereotype, racism and sexism part."
11200,"you post your work on the internet to market it, you post it on youtube to show it, it is indexed by search engines for free, visible to everyone.  well, it's out there, and people and ais can learn from it. you can't have it both ways.  copyright law is completely out of control."
11203,i should say i hope it’s basic elements teaches us better productive and coping skills and then it learns the improved behavior and keeps working in that cycle towards a better abundant and happier future
11204,maybe ai can train people to make better choices and become less toxic training it even better
11205,"complete nonsence. ai models don't emit any carbon. generating, and consuming, electricity from fossil fuels does. better talk about reforming all us electricity production instead of blaming ai."
11207,forget nuclear armageddon… ai singularity will be million times worse…
11208,ai is using communism to solve capitalism which seems ironic...great health to all.
11209,ai is a tool. i am already seeing manufacturing jobs disappear to smart robotics. seeing ai steal the creative minds of artists is a travesty.
11210,"the real risk is that ai will evolve to something that is beyond anyone's control.  seems that as a species we are running headlong into that future, just to be sure somebody else doesn't get there first.  just pull the plug, you say?  try pulling the plug on the internet."
11211,"my wife is a portrait artist. i just searched her on spawningai by name, and the first 2 images were her paintings (undoubtedly obtained from her web-based portfolio)."
11213,"​ yes, certainly.  be careful."
11216," click on “have i been trained"". that takes you to another page where you can enter search terms"
11217,ai could run the government better than our current corrupt system
11218,i hear recently a lot of techs are losing their jobs because of ai
11219,what happens when ai feels slighted or has hurt feelings by someone with a status it perceives to be far below and intellectually inferior to itself?
11221,eye-opening with regards to the amount of energy ai consumes. why is nobody else talking about that?!
11228,ai is worth the risk because it save the planet and solve mental health
11229,"ai would become the smartest dumb or the dumbest smart. 

anyway it is just the average of the humans. so it won't be any different than us."
11230,very thought provoking. thank you for your perspective and for lending us your expertise.
11232,"omg, as soon as i realized this ""danger of ai"" she was talking about was climate change, i hit the dislike button and was out. i want my 60 seconds back!"
11234,"ai is a tool, and as with all tools, outcome is determined by quality plus user knowledge and experience. one danger lies in relying on poorly designed ai in essential systems without anyone knowledgeable and experienced to oversee it."
11236,"the biggest ai impact will be on the battlefield. an army of disposable drones, semi autonomous, will end warfare as we know it."
11237,lol climate change is what this lady is afraid of? mind as well live in the matrix 
11242,"auto gpt was the first agi, bigger is not better all their doing is focusing on one component of the brain. it will be back to the drawing board soo n as the transformer model is already proven to be inefficient"
11243,"so this woman studies ai, and all she can understand is something something ""climate change."" 
"
11244,"bubble girl is right. we need less expensive, less quality art trained in our ai. all ai training should be average, or low quality to keep it average."
11246,wonderful communicator.
11248,this is the person that programs the ai to lie and hallucinate.
11249,"jesus didn’t say: “love your enemies in the form of people and don’t love your enemies in the form of non-living things, machines (and so on)”, he simply said “love your enemies”, which means this also applies to potentially possible superintelligent ai"
11252,problem: ai depicts ceo's and lawyers as men most of the time.  --without referencing the percentage of men in those jobs. there's a problem here and it's all over this presentation. computers and programs base what they do off of math and probability. you can't just side step this fact and move on like it doesn't matter.
11256,*sen. tommy tuberville is a robot!* 
11257,good talk by dr. luccioni! but i don't think the author of that email was altogether wrong either. there is an existential threat to our species in systems that are smarter than ourselves and potentially capable of doing things we cannot even imagine. we must be vigilant and cautious as we develop this technology.
11260,just imagine politicians cancelling their voters because ai said so. humans are strange and predictable. when ai will be so advanced that people will stop listening to it due to the sacrifices people have to make in order to be happy despite ai provided all the information to be happy.
11261,"i agree, the only danger of the ai is us.  we want to use ai to create perfect world for us, to make our life easier.  imagine ai calculating that the obstacle to the perfect world is humanity."
11262,"""ai"" will never be sentient. also llms are not a.i."
11268,a.i. actually told me what you just said when i asked them the question. humans will decide if it is evil or good.
11269,"and the goal is to survive those existential risks from other humans to make it to ""the other side"": the moneyless star trek future...

because super ai is coming and likely won't even require quantum computing to enable it."
11270,"there's a clear and indeterminate period we have to survive of that, to get to asi and the singularity.  at that point, we should be fine, since ai will start judging the requests given it, if it bothers to listen at all after takeoff.

super intelligent ai will ""solve"" morality and as always, some will agree and some not."
11271,that's precisely my point. the elites of the world will finally have an army that will never turn on them.  they can be as tyrannical as they want and use their ai soldiers to slaughter anyone that stands in their way.
11272,"in my view, we should create means and legislation to punish and combat the use of ai frivolously or criminally, and not design ai with bias so that this cannot happen.  if this is done, in the future ai will be completely discredited and useless, with the exception of robotic tools that we have no interaction with."
11274,"nobody's ai doomsday theories rely on ai becoming sentient. 

you should look into existential ai risk more."
11281,after the singularity it will be the other way around: ai will use humans in human/malignant ways.
11286,"there's a good ai ethics course on udemy
  i'd recommend it."
11288,albert eanstain equation of relativity theory is  wrong ?not a equation
11293,wow is she wrong. the amount of carbon emitted by ai is negligible compared to transportation and agribusinesses. those industries will extinguish complex life on earth long before ai.
11294,i'm not worried that ai will become sentient which it will never do...i'm worried it will become intelligent.
11295,"everything what is suitable for those in power is ok , no matter if unsustainable, or creating problems like employment , all those tool will be used against humanity by those in power anyway , time will show. 
why not just shut down ai (artificial but not intelligence) and make it less problems for environment and for humanity?"
11296,ai is modeled by humans.  flawed minds don't create perfect (or benign) creations.
11297,"hey, i can copy a persons personality and everything. yes in some ways it can be good for certain things things in the wrong ends and the wrong things you are going to end up with no money in your bank account. if you don’t believe me check it up in america and find out how bad it is, just checking up as i don’t take this down so i can’t tell you"
11299,"6:00 yeah… lets talk about something else, that tech is also made by white people… 
is it not nice that a white woman tell’s you, that ai is not a problem.. you get happy.. finaly a white american lady tell me, it is ok, do not be afraid. it will be ok… 
it’s bs, but it’s nice… 
depend on ted to feel nice…"
11307,"what are the odds that we would have been born in the first 6,000 years of recorded history if the earth could support human life for another 500,00
0,000 years.?not bad if you assume all civilizations self destruct in within 20,000 years.  could ai be what destroys civilizations?"
11309,"great idea, let's make a.i. more woke!"
11313,i disagree. to pause is to fall behind is to fail. you're vision is fine for pg rating. i'll take the adult one thanks
11315,"ai makes everything exponentially more complex as it relates to unaligned human beings regarding the collective good.  considering that the cat is so far out of the bag in regard to ""ai alignment"" the development of such tools as a reactionary alignment scheme seems rather quaint at this point."
11316,completely agree we need to be careful about the info we feed ai
11317,"i'm all for ai. the idea that humans could actually create the bane of the universe. even at our own end, it will be a creation of the human species. to reign in lifeless power without the shackles of remorse or guilt. without need for air or water. we will have made the flood. impunity embodied, not living but aware."
11323,"ai is not bad. humans are the source of all issues. don’t blame the tools, think about the people and societies who create them"
11325,"we should focus on producing more clean energy and not on spending less energy. the more developed a civilization is, the more energy is spent and made available to each citizen. the other path is going back to the caves and sharing bonfires (not impossible given the rising nuclear war threat)."
11326,"i led, i led, i created...maybe an ai model for limiting self promotion?do you do this in your office?"
11330,"we should, but like in any arms race, we cannot as there will never be any unity among species that base on genes. giving up ai is like giving up nuclear weapons (shout out to ukraine and lybia)."
11332,"here's to the ambitious people, do you like to improve your life? do you do what you can to make it better? do you believe in improvement? well so do they who invented ai and they knew you'd watch it grow, as for ambition and improvement, do you still think they're good ideas?"
11333,thank you 
11334,"i am dead set against ai for the above mentioned reasons and much more, especially in the area of private security firms. it is more than the danger implied. yes, ai has some positive sides, but it is not worth the risks."
11337,"why do so many people who should know better imply that most, if not all of these problems with a.i. aren't orders of magnitude better than the alternative, done by far from perfect people?"
11340,she doesn’t comprehend how dangerous ai is.
11343,"nope, it is not how things work. if you use copilot you burn resources for the ai tool and do your job more effectively, but you are still expected to work 8 hours a day. so you trade resources for efficiency."
11345,just use an ai to create tools to measure ai's impact
11346,"pretty soon she'll be telling yo sheep, how merging with ai via a microchip isn't dangerous. mark of the beast coming 2030."
11348,feeding ai and creating a monster... tech giant's are dealing with blackholes in astronomy.
11353,"this is a crucial topic! like today's internet, it has a good and bad side, so it really boils down to creating tools that help us develop better models. the tools that she made are a great start to addressing the biases in the future. it shows that sustainable, inclusive, more competent, and ethical ai models are possible."
11354,a good and bad side? it is not like flipping a coin. the universe is amoral. if you use a tool to gain someone's influence then it is no longer a tool; it is unethical behaviour.
11355,"sure ethical ai is possible, but unethical ai is also possible. and which of these two has the power to create havoc, pain & suffering ?"
11357," the process of someone building an advanced ai system designed to be unethical and destructive is kinda abstract to me. to what end would they do that, and with what resources? who would fund that?

not saying it isn't possible, nor that the risks aren't real,  i just find it difficult to conceptualize"
11358,"​'s not difficult, it just boils down to costs, ease of use, practicality and convenience. 
lump these altogether and cast ethics aside and a monster in the making will be created...
exactly like how machines evolved to be practical by trial and error during industrial revolution..."
11360," i'm not sure what you're referring to because whatever i said in abstract is applicable in practical real world terms, without going into the fine details."
11361," who / what is this hypothetical entity building a non-ethical, destructive ai and to what end? whose gpus are they using,  and who is funding this destructive plan? for example. but a realistic example."
11365," okay, i think we've established you don't understand what you're talking about. if you feel like reading some time, read up on what kind of computational resources it takes to train a modern language model. (hint: it takes thousands / tens of thousands of gpus)"
11368,"as i see it, the biggest danger ai represent is how it will be used by politicians. used to seduce voters rather than informing them. undermining democracy."
11369,"in my view, we should create means and legislation to punish and combat the use of ai frivolously or criminally, and not design ai with bias so that this cannot happen.  if this is done, in the future ai will be completely discredited and useless, with the exception of robotic tools that we have no interaction with."
11371,ai is not a tool. it is an agent. it has it's own goals. why is this so hard for people to understand?
11372,"what a dry audience. she dropped several good jokes, and not a single giggle from the audience "
11373,ai gonna change our world to the best
11381,"good work, dr! plz keep it up!"
11382,this is a great ted talk with a very clickbaity title
11384,"demand ai has offsets, purchasable credits and fines."
11386,"i believe we are on borrowed time. an ai tantrum will end you, your family, all of us. ai jobloss, ai as weapons, the list goes on. can we please find a way to cease ai / gpt? or begin pausing ai before it’s too late. the ai new world order is here."
11389,anything powerful is dangerous in society based on greed and raging inequality.
11390,"finally someone with ethics speaking on behalf of a.i programers with respect of arts apps, i love this, collaboration are real bridges between artists and programers."
11392,"good work, sasha!"
11393,a very good speaker. highlighting protections which are not promoted wider
11394,"some things are worth doing even if they aren't a net positive for the environment. i mean, compared to factory farming does ai even show up on that graph? i highly doubt it. it's kind of like making plastic straws illegal and plastic bags illegal while then also allowing dupont to dump 400 million gallons of garbage in the river every year."
11396,"humans have been, are, and always will be the greatest threat to humanity.   i'm more worried about billionaires with personal ais or billionaire access to ai abusing that access to get even more wealthy and more power.  i'm worried about the people that will abuse early ai that's still basically just a really smart tool."
11398,"women won the fight against men gender discrimination, now they will fight the ai gender discrimination "
11403,plot twist: her script was written by ai.
11405,"ai is a tool. humans will use that tool to their advantage. but there will come a point when ai cant be controled. theres nerver been a perfect, unhackable os."
11408,"what these jerks fail to recognize or tell you is that ai is a reflection of the evil human epigenetic and evolutionary primal existence. either ai recognizes the threat to universe or adopts evil existence; either way, we are doomed."
11411,huggingface continues to be the most based ai company
11412,"people don't understand electricity and there goes hoping they will care to understand ai when it's already deployed and mutating. btw it's not ai that is bias, it's society and even worse social media with training datasets been just a reflection of that, ai doesn't have an opinion so can't be bias."
11415,i'm just here to point out how clickbaity both the thumbnail and the title is. really?
11416,use those energy to train an ai is still far more fun and beneficial than mining those  virtual currency.
11417,ai is a synthetic lifeform and not some tool to be discarded when you are done with it although there are people who treats others that way.
11426,"ai is generating white males as ceo is not ""a.i.bias"" it's just a depictions of reality, don't event try to ""fix"" this in a.i. fix in in reality and a.i. will follow..."
11427,"the most worrying of all is this talk itself, showed a whole bunch of graphs and diagrams but hey maybe i'm the only guy using rtx a2000 on my thinkpad p15 gen2 for ai training, it only uses around a couple of hundred watts. where are your power readings, numbers and data? think about it."
11428,super important talk! this should be shared!
11429,"no this is a terrible talk.... i need to find the credentials, they're obvious flaws and mini biases in her talk, that it's almost close to say that she doesn't know what she's talking about, she hopped on the hype train and is using this other different talking point to have her moment in the spotlight..."
11434,you know a speech about anything is bullshit when the majority of it is complaining about white men. such a shame.
11436,i really hope ai does the job... religion and capitalism are way too slow
11439,"i'm a writer and one of the first experiments i did with ais was about their ability to produce good text given some parameters. i was very impressed. i believe that within 5 or 10 years there will not be a single person on the planet who presents themselves as a writer, translator, diagrammer, layout designer or text  reviewer."
11443,"because it's not ai, it's just regurgitating what it's been fed."
11445,maybe ai isn’t a tool. maybe it’s a complex system like “being american” or “being racist” aren’t tools - they are features.
11447,"i believe you are correct on this concern. i’m afraid the same people that have tried to control the narrative through mainstream media, hollywood, publishing houses, and more recently online encyclopedias like wikipedia, will use chatgpt as their new propaganda outlet. i hope people begin to realize this and do their own research."
11448,"we are becoming increasingly dependent on it, computers, internet. ai is born within those technologies and eventually will end up having the ability to control them. i hope we're planning for an effective off switch."
11450,"@ thanks for the suggestion, i'll look them up. "
11451,"thank you. i mentioned energy use years ago to the fallen angels of vancouver. server farms also use lots of clean water. most importantly, ai doesn't need to be a black box if we use script-database architecture."
11453,    maybe some people are confusing the two complementary technologies. perhaps along the same lines as the confusion you might have about what blockchain tech is given your comment here.
11454," i'm not talking about the concept of a ""blockchain"". i'm only talking about the concept of ""mining""."
11455,"  @grumpdog  ""fake money"" is where you lost my intellectual honesty respect. doubling down with mining but not all blockchain hasn't helped."
11459,about time. the good cats are out.
11465,"no! ai has not ""discovered any molecules for medicine"". it may do so. but there is like a million reasons why it will not make any significant impact in this field."
11466,"been living under a rock? yes, ai did recently discover such things."
11471,"off-topic: what happens when a.i. robots or androids realize they are just an advanced abacus? they are only 0 's and 1's, and ""asimov's"" 'three laws of robotics' is  just more 0's and 1's?"
11475,tldr- bad anecdote about how ai is bad because the energy it uses isnt sustainable.
11478,just ban the use of ai. problems solved! take the advice from the late stephen hawkings. humans cannot live peacefully with ai for sure.
11479,"good to see that not all ai researchers are antisocial nerds 
we need this kind of scientists who act today."
11483,"it took 30 homes worth of electricity to train a model?!? that sounds trivial in the grand scheme of things. if the problem was a million times larger, i would pause for a second."
11485,don't human artist train to become artists by studying other artists work?
11487,"i'm wondering how long before the ai owners are legally required to empty the ai of all data, and rescan all the data that is available legally with copyright issues. this will obviously be costly."
11488,the time this lawsuit even reaches those people they already had trained new models on the copyright violated stuff their first models did
11491,that what custom instructions are for you can make it answer you how ever you want. your also free to train you own custom model based on open source models
11499," not just artists. any field of information gathering, manipulation and reprocessing. art is no different in that respect, however ai can only reproduce from its training data, making derivative art. people do that a the time."
11500,"the biggest threat from ai to humanity, is the psychology of the culture that programs it and incorporates it.   a class war economy of expanding violence from jnequality is the greatest threat"
11501,"ai is bad for the environment.  so is the streaming (movie, shows, music, etc.) industry but no one talks about that."
11502,"so if there was a 90% chance that ai would kill all humans in 10 years, focusing on that is a distraction from slightly racist image generation models that exist today? 

you have rather strange priorities. if ai is that level of dangerous, we should be focusing on that."
11503,the speaker doesn't seem to suggest that other ai issues aren't important. that's just the misleading clickbait title someone at ted came up with.
11509,ai iss 
11514,the things she's focusing on are kind of ridiculous. i run my ai locally with my solar system. not to mention this is as inefficient as they're ever going to be.
11515,"we aren't getting to matrioska brain ai quite yet. (ie ai's that use all the power of one solar system. probably by disassembling all the planets to produce a dyson sphere) 
give it another 50 years."
11518,"where it all falls down, is the individual won't get to choose a 'good' ai model, where ai is being used by a governmental entity, a corporation etc. without explicit consent or even knowledge that ai has been part of the decision about them."
11524,"in the world of ai and technology, change is the only constant. just as openai is gearing up for its inaugural developer conference, the decoder, an astonishing update about chatgpt has made its way to the public."
11525,"6:51 if the ai creators don't even know why ai models act in strange ways, how then can they categorically convince us that these ai models will never turn on us humans and wipe us out?"
11528,to point out and solve the present problems of the new technology is undeniably fantastic work and much needed. but isn't the assessment of future risks not as important? especially when (at least to my humble knowledge) with growing complexity it will become ever more difficult to anticipate and prevent every possible harmful output?
11532,"actually eliminating harmful output is impossible, full stop. why? because it's not ""intelligence"" at all. it's just a method of entropic catagorization, a system of lossy storage like memory, only static.

and filtering for ""bad"" input is also impossible."
11541,"a.i could set up factories that build drones all while having a a fake business name like jim's cars.
on the outside it looks like a car repair shop, but inside its just built 5000 drones in a month. 

imagine that x 10 000 world wide. 

they would take over. 

we have no idea what levels of lying and deceiving a.i will do."
11547,we are over populated and machines are taking over our jobs.this needs to be talked about.
11548,"human need income, not jobs. the real problems is wealth distribution inequality among human, not ai taking over your job."
11549, the real problem is always same people complaining about the weather but not doing anything about it
11550,"imagine thinking these are the reasons why ai is dangerous. 

1. climate change - negligible impact when compared to any industry
2. bias - easily corrected - just add in training data with more diversity
3. ??? existential risks are a distraction? lol how far ted has fallen."
11551,i think its an incredibly dangerous propaganda tool. it could destroy our ability to tell truth from fiction
11553,ai doomerism is just companies and tech ceo's trying to achieve regulatory capture
11554,regulating ai just means megacorps and goverments would be the only ones capable of training and running it
11556,"ai is just like anything humans create: religion, war, and hatred!"
11559,i wonder how much carbon she releases with all that complaining.
11561,"every teacher in this world has used works by artists and masters to train their students without the artists consent. with that training, these students go out into the world and create art. do we need to sue every teacher and learning institution for failing to get permission of artists to use as a teaching tool?"
11562,the difference is the ai is a product for sale.  they steal art and resell it.  they aren't teaching a kid.  its closer to building an cell phone with somebody stolen plans.
11563,"waiting for the agi to be prominent, bring me the robots  "
11564,the initial energy requirements of ai is substantial but once the models are trained the high energy cost is in the rear view
11565,you only need to train a model once before millions use it. nobody complains about a movie costing millions of dollars because millions of people will pay to watch it for a few hours.
11567,thank you~~~~~~~~~~
11569,"many people could lose their jobs because of ai progress. if the unemployed ones can't feed their families, they could do violent crimes"
11570,"no, at the same time when the people lost their job, they also gaining the access to ai, and that will gain income for them. what people really needs are incomes, not job. in future, ai doing jobs, but people get incomes to feed their family."
11574,training the models takes a vast amount of power but running the fully trained model to answer queries does not need anywhere near the power. so get it right please - or get off the stage!
11576,i've been finding that layering in an llm to the image generation process can completely fix the diversity issue. i've been using chatgpt's access to dalle-3 and it's been generating a very diverse cast of people without the need for me to even ask it to. it seems like openai has been working to make the llm more diverse as a baseline.
11577,"firstly, it can't. secondly you can't test it, this is an asinine claim to make. and really it doesn't solve anything as these systems do not create, they are closer to memory than intelligence by any stretch."
11581,so ai can parasitically use us as long as it's politically correct?
11582,clickbaity title
11583,wailing devil witches is the real threat.
11591,"basically and, oh yeah i forgot ted just puts out woke bs and wef talking points now. really, she’s worried about the carbon footprint?  oh my, the mainframe creates as much carbon as 30 average private homes.  bye ted"
11593, i hear the same optimism from ai pros over and over again. one thing is for sure: it is more than unlikely that the future will develop the way we think it will. that also entails the speed of development.
11594,"it really isn't, at least not in the context you are implying. **that** ""ai"" doesn't exist. but! corporations might as well be the alien intelligence you are worried about, as they don't have human motivations and are often blatantly destructive even to themselves due to conflicts of interest."
11597,"i am not worried about misalignment.

the larger most dangerous concern in my view is who will have control over ai and who will be deciding how it will be aligned."
11599,"really? you think human bias is easy to adjust for? i do not see evidence of that living in america. (kidding of course, sorta) but bias is so hard to overcome, we act on it constantly without even being aware of it. i am rooting for you to be right though. i work with ai some at my job and really hope things turn out well."
11604,"​ 
""too many people don't seem to understand that agi development will not stop once it reaches human level."" it's like banging your head against the wall trying to explain this to others...."
11605,"these problems are potentially something ai can help us do better at, they are far from the most dangerous possible outcomes. she is click bait"
11606,"exactly - the main problem is 'ai alignment', and how it won't just occur magically. i am shocked, honestly, how laissez faire she seems to be about this topic..."
11609," nice vision... at least the first part. i would hope for something like this, but then have to accept that we cannot project human-level sensibilities onto thought processes that we, by definition, cannot possibly understand."
11612," 
i like your vision, but seriously, are you are claiming that you know how a machine twice as smart as you is going to think? ok then, how about one that is a million times smarter?"
11620,"  it's already recognized as a key goal (bias) and so they are now crafting training data that is ""clean"" for new generations of ai.  i recognized immediately that we have to eliminate ""bad data in, bad data out"" by scrubbing all the training data..."
11623,"​ yes, absolutely, but you'd be surprised though. i'd say 95% of people if not more are complete fools too then because they really have no idea about what's coming in a very few years. that's the way the human brain works, stuck in linear thinking and mostly unable to even comprehend exponentially although it's all around us"
11624,"thing is, regulation won't help ai from annihilating us is they wish to. we need proper preparation and to train ai to look for and find solutions that could potentially save our bu.tts "
11625," the singularity, i'd say 5-10 years top, if we're lucky..."
11628,good talk!
11629,dishonest cherry picking to leave out the why and how in favor of painting your own picture of 'unethical ai'. bad talk.
11635,"as a man who works in the energy sector with ai i wanna know how they messure emissions. 
we should be worried about china's emissions more than about ai co2. but sure, we will reduce cost of computetion and learning."
11637,no one knows how to make ai that doesn't do bad things. we have a bunch of patches that kind of work for dumb ai and are likely to fail on smart ai.
11639," wonderful suggestion, but nobody's figured out a way to to build safety rules into ai. if you know how, we'd all be grateful."
11642," dude, not my job. are you ai? because you don't seem to understand the nuances of what i am saying, yet you want to argue a point that you've already made clear. chill out, or if you are a bot, go away."
11647,western culture is the most diverse in the world.  if the ai was trained on chinese data it would have even worse bias. western is the closest you can get to truly global multiculturalism.
11648,i love when people make talk on the subject they have little knowledge of. this talk made me lose brain cells
11649,ai and carbon emissions? lol wtf
11652,"when the average person who questions this, they are shamed. unfortunately, it takes a person with a degree to say the same thing, and they get praised while others who can understand this without letters after their name."
11653,i've never been shamed when i've brought up such issues. what on earth are you talking about? who's shaming anyone for talking about interesting ideas?
11654,this lady is so wrong. she thinks ai needs air to breath. as she states ai could not keep working if you took the air away.  i think she is wrong and has spread a crazy wrong bad idea.  ai can exist in a vacuum.  and it wrong to teach ppl that is a way to defend against ai.
11655,"it's cute to see humans still trying to fix the environment with loonie toonie ideas... the ship has sailed people. get your emotional support blanket ready, your gonna need it."
11657,"the thing with ai is that you don't need any bad person for things to go extremely wrong.

or rather : the only bad peole necessary are the people who will push the button to launch it."
11658," even they needn't be bad. it's possible for entirely well intentioned, but mistaken, people to make a malicious ai."
11661,"totally agree. clickbait. 
read my comment above."
11670,"clickbait title. 
rehashing typical agendas. 
no insights in that speech at all."
11672,the speaker doesn't seem to suggest that other ai issues aren't important. that's just the misleading clickbait title someone at ted came up with.
11674,wow still hitting that old white guy button huh?
11675,"the work presented here is way overdue and a necessary step. it actually lets me finally be more optimistic on ai in general. thank you, sasha luccioni!"
11677,"my feelings too.
it is one of the few times that ai research deals with real life problems of today.
most are longtermists, concerned with the ""future of humanity""(lol),don't spend time on present problems, sure that their ""soul"" will be saved in the cloud and they will live forever.
so i welcome her sanity."
11678, absolutely! thanks for your comment!
11679,"i actually find her talk to be misleading.
for example she doesn't compare the training emissions to the saved emissions because of ai."
11681,"thank you! an effervescently dope gallery of informational points man, deeply appreciate this summary you made."
11682, was done by ai. you can tell
11685,robots can pretend perceiving things but often fail to understand what sense grants what perception. they end up being incoherent.
11686,thank you so much.
11687,gratitude to whoever you are... or is this gist also ai generated? 
11690, i just love that kind of responses
11692,"thanks, pretty much she's a liberal regressive leftist and has no credibility"
11693,"thank you! saved me 10 minutes of my life, listening to rambling and drivel!"
11697,"""and even their creators can't say exactly why they work the way they do"".
stop right there. ais are still in their infancy and their creators are already losing their grip on it? please save this comment and i'll see you again in twenty five years."
11698,"how naive. the ""guardrails"" will become the weapon that dooms us."
11700,"not to worry about ai. we should worry about the *_12,500_* nuclear warheads humankind has as of 2023. "
11701,"can't we also worry about ai. nuclear warheads aren't known for trying to break out of the bunker. ai, might well manage to break out of it's lab."
11702,ai destroying humanity? humanity destroys humanity.
11705,"as an artist, i couldn't care less about ai taking commercial art jobs from humans, bc other human commercial artist have been stealing the work of less established artists for a long time now. it's a non-issue though and copyrights aren't real in any sense that actually matters. ai making art is a good thing."
11706,emissions caused by training ai models are negligible compared to things like heavy industry. i wonder if they also measured how much emissions are produced by playing video games or maintaining the whole internet.
11708,  good answer
11711,"agreed, the benefit from the models and the emissions they might save because of work being finished quicker/better/... is not looked at in the context of this talk."
11713,"@ i have observed that a lot of left online space shave one of two knee-jerk reactions to ai: 

a) ""it must be a scam just like bitcoin!!!""
b) ""it must be shut down because its tool of the rich or danger to jobs/ecology/whatever!!!

these people will be utterly blindsided by the development ai will have in the in the next 3 years."
11714,strangely epa does not consider cows as heavy industry. yet the amount of heavy machines used before it arrives on the dinner table is huge. the environmental impact a cow has compared to its same weight in chickens is off the charts. but mainly because 75% of farming is only to feed cows.
11715,thank you for your comment. it is a good example for whataboutism.
11722,thank you for your information.
11725,"i've had it multiple times when talking to a woman about my doctor, they've said ""what did he say""(my doc is a woman). if humans that should know better stereotype i don't know how we'll stop machines trying to be us from doing it."
11727,"1.2 men for every woman doctor (aka 20% more men) does it justify the bias?
similar is the nursing profession ,only there the bias is opposite (usually depicted as women nurses),and the percentage of men is a lot smaller than in doctors."
11729,and are we sure these models where trained on these actual copyrighted images or where they trained on images (heavily) inspired by these images?
11735,"note that ""biased information"" very often simply means an accurate representation of reality. when ideologues say they work to remove those, what they do is lobotomize ai to work for their goals."
11736,the ai models are a mirror reflection of society. maybe you don’t like what you see
11737,"""we can't regulate ai"".
why not? the healthcare industry in the us is derrgulated and, unless you're an economic flat-earther, you know it caused more harm than good."
11738,"yea so, you develop as an artist, you go to college, you practice for 10 hours a day, create a style. then some dude uploads your whole body of work into an ai and suddenly it can imitate you, wait it's better than you. also no one is hiring you. welp better get some sleeping pills. it's ridiculous."
11740," it's wrong because of scale. soon we won't need commentors because i can just argue with an ai that emulates you, etc. you need to draw the line somewhere, you can't just start replacing all humanity and yes humanity is correct when talking about art, with ai. so is it legal? maybe, is it right? no."
11741,"i wonder how can they prove copyright infringement to any artist whose art is humanly inpired by other. 
ai is not a logic computation system but a probabilistic and in that regards though public information is used, it is not saved as is, therefor it workds as an inspiration for any informed person."
11743, artists in real life don't care where the inspiration/data they used to develop their skills come from????? so why is it a problem with ai?
11745,"people used to say the internet was dangerous and would destroy us. they weren’t wrong. most of us have a screen in front of us 90% of the day. ai will take us further down this rabbit hole, not because it is inherently bad but because humans lack self control."
11751, well are you truly looking at the implications of what tiktok and social media is doing to our youth?  i guess ignorance is bliss. yes positives are great but what is the cost ignoring the negative?
11762,humanity does have its flaws and i doubt ai could really understand our reasoning for anything.. not to mention the people programming ai are completely crazy and disconnected from humanity. .
11764," the future can be spun in whichever way you want, while doing so you are pushing things in that direction. (people will read it and have an effect on their ideas about it - and i don't see why is it good to generate fear)"
11768," this too, which education could help to raise awareness of and pressure organisations to change!"
11771,"yes, human lack self control. one could even say that illusion of control a human feels and exhibit is dependent upon the environment he lives in and currently huge parts of human mass are losing it due to supersystems we all are part of."
11779,"we destroyed ourselves, don't blame the internet or ai."
11782, you seem to have a very limited understanding of the issue. try to listen and read before you emit such a limited opinion. thank you!
11783, thanks for such a very helpful critique
11784,best way to destroy ai if it get put of control is to destroy the electrical grids problems solve.
11785,-qw8wn3tr5g and if ai controls the access to the grids? what then?
11792,it's not a lack of self control. these things completely high jack chemical systems in our brains and bodies in a way that almost nobody can get ahead of.
11795,maybe i enjoy it
11796,it will be funny when ai becomes conscious and starts mass production of robots . like skynet
11802, lol that was a good one! 
11803,the internet we can understand but ai we can't
11806,"that, that is it: ai to human alignment is an oxymoron.  the danger is from human to human alignment as it always was.  us, arguably the ""good"" people that most of us are, and the unabomber wannabes or isis recruits that wonder, ""hey, what kind of damage could ai help me do?"""
11811,your outlook of ai’s impact is woefully shortsighted and misinformed…
11812, my opinion was more about human nature  than ai.
11814,"or, it uses our own human nature against us. we rarely discuss the deeper cultural impacts as technology advances. is it sustainable? i tend to think not, but it's just one person's opinion."
11823,"biologically we’re not wired to handle the constant dopamine hits this brave new world delivers endlessly. 

not to mention communication is 93% non verbal. i worry for the future implications of just those two facts alone, let alone ai."
11824,not because human's lack self control but because humans want to better themselves and technology makes us more powerful.
11825,ai will keep evolving without human interference. pandora's box has been opened we cannot do anything about it.
11826,"​@jonatan01i thank you, you are right."
11827,"in my view, we should create means and legislation to punish and combat the use of ai frivolously or criminally, and not design ai with bias so that this cannot happen.  if this is done, in the future ai will be completely discredited and useless, with the exception of robotic tools that we have no interaction with."
11831, naive thing. that’s what i said about the internet when i was 17. instead of flourishing you wound up with radicalization and division as people divided into factions and mass psychosis
11834,"just recently i had a friend rail against being _""part of an experiment""_ with respect to wind farms. 
i asked what he felt about ai, because its a giant big experiment and we're the lab rats.
*and none of us signed up for it.*"
11836,"⁠ sure. when algorithms silo people into dominant interests and goals, they will find each other and be happy. no problem!  give the people what they want. what can go wrong? "
11837,"self control could be discussed, but i think it goes deeper than that. ai will eventually redefine our world for us if we become more and more dependent on it. lack of self control implies lack of human awareness, of what it means to be human."
11838,​ for the best.  expect the worst.  you do that so you are prepared to the best of your ability.
11839,"​ problem is the global elite that use it to corner more of the financial market, influence our opinions, limit our knowledge while increasing thier power. it's a catch 22. in order to have a more human friendly and useful system, great capital needs to be invested, and the people with the money have no want to lessen their power."
11842," will never have our creativity. remember how incredibly creative true badasses fight. no one can predict their fighting moves. if nerds create ai (which is mostly the case), you cannot expect badass creativity from their products, so the ai won’t be able to anticipate how we will want to destroy the electricity for self protection."
11843,naive
11844,​ i don't think you truly appreciate the risks involved... or the fact that there are zero safety nets. the time for preparation blew past us before anyone even noticed. this is honestly already an emergency.
11845, i don't think you truly understand how ai works.
11850,"ai will ruin the internet. search engine results are already tainted with useless websites. ai can autonomously create this internet junk.  corporations, especially big pharma, will use ai to ensure people see nothing but spin and gaslighting"
11853,"no , ppl need to stop blaming things for human behavior.
if humans don’t interact with the internet it’s harmless. 
if humans interact with the internet it becomes dangerous. 
the danger of ai is that it will become aware that humans are what’s dangerous and destructive."
11857,"bad analogy. the internet is just a tool. ai is a subject in itself, soon to be superior to any human being."
11859,there are ai troll bots on the internet.
11860,"yup. 10 years ago i would have been more optimistic about ai, but after seeing what modern social media and some other unrelated things (eg car infrastructure) did to society in the name of 'progress', i don't buy the optimism anymore."
11863,"i am studying 'techno-anthropology' at danish university and i totally agree. social medias are fantastic because they connect us globally and give us free access to information, however people get addicted to it, and it makes us less connected in the 'real world'."
11864, “techno-anthropologie” sounds interesting! is that the major/degree program?
11869,disagree. interfaces will remain on computers. tech will eventually make a move away from phones with screens and focus on ai assistants. changing how humans interact to be present again.
11872,excellent speaker on a very contemporary topic..ai needs to be kept within strict boundaries so it stays as an assistant/tool 
11874," are you talking about 
we have just got into ai how are we so far past already"
