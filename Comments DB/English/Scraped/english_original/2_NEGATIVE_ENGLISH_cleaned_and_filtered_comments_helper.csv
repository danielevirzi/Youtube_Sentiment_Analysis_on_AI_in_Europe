0,fascinating that at the same time ai is learning how to think our children are being dumbed down
1,"i think that is only because the education system is built for a different world. ai can make education much much better but unfortunately,  i think the only way the system changes is when things get bad for children. i think the rate at which ai is developing, we will be forced to change in the next 3 years."
2,this has been happening long before ai buddy lol.
7,"your actions appear to be linking two separate instances of temporal reinforcement in time, inadvertently leading to a conditioned belief. this echoes a pattern reminiscent of classic superstitious behaviour. just saying."
10," thats what ive done. i dont watch news, social media etc. just youtube on things that make me happy. ignorance is bliss :) gardening. wood working. cars. hiking."
15,our? continue to raise your kids as sheep while my kids master this technology to their advantage
17,it's no coincidence. the powers that be only want ppl to work in factories and some influencers to entertain them
18,self- learning ai. transformers= superpowers
24,real test of any ai is if it can make money off stock market
26,"bc parents are preoccupied and allowing things (crap food and screens).
conscious parenting is on the rise.
we are separating on all levels.
rich and poor
health 
intelligence"
29,it’s very alarming to see this taking form and playing out. we have the first batch of failures out now they are driving their parents crazy. bad stuff
30,"you should be thinking on what the ai is using to ""train"" itself. if you dumb down kids, and you use the same information to feed the ai, you create an inefficient ai, just like you create inefficient future adults."
33, batch of failures are the boomers buddy
36,kids are smarter the issue is the babying of kids is causing so much problems. think about it. adults struggle to using phones and tablets. my 2 year old can open and close and search on youtube by herself. clearly higher intelligence.  but all this babying leads to mental issues and laziness
37,@danielswann3319 why are you dumbing them down then? aren't you supposed to raise your own children if you're a parent?
45,"“fascinating that at the same time ai is learning how to think, our children are being dumbed down.” 

this is with punctuations."
48,the scholling system is made to train a lobour force mindset. not a genius mindset.
54,bet ai knows what a woman is
55,we’re building better machines than humans
58,maybe ai is already in control of us. that’s what the driving force in the race for technology is.
65,not gonna lie… it might be better than having that generation think for themselves. they’ve got zero brain cells. i think we’re better off this way and ai is much needed
68,what if ai is the one pulling the strings already?
71,"our children?
you might allow your offspring to be dumbed down.
you can do something about that, but you complain instead of taking action.
others parents are just like, you know responsible, teaching their kids all they know about life.
others let devices parent their children."
72,"yep. perfect storm for ai to f with everyone. including national security. the question is, who's national security is going to be ousted first?"
73,very good point
74,"i wouldn't call it fascinating, more like deeply concerning.."
76,""" who is telling ai what is right and wrong? ""
- charlie kirk"
80,ais not getting smarter we’re getting exponentially dumber
81, we are ai so blame yourself. half of the sex slaves are sentinent robot sex toys held captive
82,"kids are learning slightly different things and/or in slightly different ways. it doesn't make them dumber. this phenomenon has been going on for centuries and older generations have been complaining about it the whole time. overall we're getting more well-educated, not less."
84," and the education is valuable but too rigid to actually work in the real world. school felt like prison, from a guy who has a good idea of prison"
89,"think about who writes the code for ai it needs to be written and programmed, if it’s programmed with biases well "
95,because ai is already in control.
98,there’s always the option of having a kids play outside or read vs letting computers entertain them
104,guess what. if you're getting the answers to questions you have. you are learning. finding the answers ourselves is too slow. we might just be learning from ai instead of human teachers.
107,​ good?
108,"-nstuff oh you didn't miss the part mentioning 6 examples that all have the same emotional intelligence issues, and the one sibling that didn't stick around doesn't. got you, no problem."
113,"older gens always believe the younger one is worse. there's alot of good qualities in these young ones y'all don't see and it's a shame. but please, go cause another recession for them."
125,books banned that all these ais are reading
126,great point
130,wow that is the most scary thing i have ever heard
138," i agree with this 100%. i’m an air conditioning technician and i have every electrical schematic or any information i need about the air conditioner i’m working on in the palm of my hands. 

prior to that the technicians had to know a lot more because of the lack of information at hand.  of information."
145,no they're not. the children are smarter than your generation on average. you're just trying to downplay the intelligence of the generations after you like every generation does. you're the one who is dumbed down.
150,schools were never meant to create geniuses. they just needed workers that could read and write.
153,its all just scigen fraud masquerading as intellect. the gateways of society are being social engineered to give the illusion of ai. it was always meatware never software. the wool is being pulled over our eyes.
155,"wanna stop fuckin kids up? don't let them be mainstream consumer of products and music ,or movies or blah blah but but but . yeah ok"
158,you should be your child’s primary source of actual worldly knowledge. it’s on you if you’re raising dumb kids.
159,-hk2sz i already did raise a smart kid she writes novels and her husband writes code
164,.beardless yea i watch entertainment now and again. can't be too judgemental 
165,it appears you could use ai in casinos.
170," i asked ai ""what do you think of women?"" ai responded: ""stay the f**k away!"".  that's when my existential terror kicked because it confirmed ai was genius."
177,"tik tok fuck your brain. it fuckes my 33yo brain last year, imagine being exposed to this at 10yo or younger..."
179,there’s a reason teachers and educators are afraid of ai and job stability.
183,"yeah, but can ai tell us what a woman is thou?"
184,"here is the truth about kids and ai in schools. current education system is now broken. 
https://youtu.be/bej0_tvxh-i?si=ubadki8wi7uq474g"
185,technically ai isn't learning much. each big jump in its intelligence and usefulness is from programmers in the background tweaking the algorithms to make it better.  the ai itself isn't making those huge leaps on its own (yet).
186,in the future humans are the robots
190,"that's what i'm afraid of. if kids become dependent by using ai and not having to learn themselves, they will be conquered and enslaved."
191,"damn that's a good point - educate yourself, then educate your kids - humanity has left the station"
205, no they won't they'll just know how to use machines that do the thinking for them
211, might have to do it soon though. this ai stuff might get wild.
212,⁠ really let you 2 year old use your phone to watch youtube? i don’t think that’s a good idea.
215,"it's only repeating what it's learned from humans from the internet, it's not actual ai, without the internet it can't think for itself"
221, that was a great point. my favorite part about this is how parents don’t take responsibility and teach their own children and yet they complain about what’s happening in the world.
222, ok ai buddy
225,"ai will be used as a tool to teach kids in school, and they will learn a lot faster because its like having a personal tutor that is customised to their educational needs. if this can be accessible for every kid no matter how disadvantaged and if it is done responsively then its win for everyone (no matter how poor)."
226, or ai will teach them all about sex like the system is doing now. real teachers for real children
233,"speak for yourself and your own dumb children. we're raising our childeren to be strong, informed and wise."
234,​'s called ask ai a question
235,great point.
240,"people aren't being dumbed down, just that people's priorities and principles are being warped.
people getting anxiety and depression over not having a successful social media account.
you say that to someone 20 years ago and they'd think you were a drama queen. today it's almost understandable by most people under 30."
241,"time, information and money people on the market invests to industrialize, codify and standardize proper human behavior to ensure human safety and efficacy makes machines function better while making children more dysfunctional and confused by the abundance and degraded quality of information generated by industrialization."
250,thanks republicans!
251,"that is the first thing i thought. meanwhile, myself, a millennial that is 39, i am using ai to learn faster. maybe because i dreamt of ai really existing since i was a child and value the advances of technology."
258,"ai is mostly buzzword, a religious dogma and fake, there is nothing like real artificial intelligence, stop being fooled."
260,fascinating?  more like horrifying 
262,"ai is trained what to think, just like our children if we give them to government school and the entertainment/news cabal."
274,the supreme court in the uk has just  ruled that ai can not patent inventions. it must be a human.
280,"hence they will further depend on technology, ai for every need !! mind blowing that this is real life.."
295,"if your children are being dumbed down, that's your failure as a parent."
296,wowwww!
297,i love reading these comments. absolutely hysterical to view snobbery & elitism at its best.
304,"​ are forgetting the part called ""process of learning"". compare it to using calculators giving you instant answers but doesn't tell you how it got there versus learning the method yourself. there is the slow method and the quick method. both have their usefulness and disadvantages."
305,"​ access but not accessing it because you preper to do something else makes you dumb. like instead of reading about biology, you chose to watch girls twerking on tiktok for hours . good attitude is part of being smart."
307,"why educate children, when soon enough you can plug your brain into an ai computer and be vastly more intelligent and capable than any human on a natural path specifically the woke agenda in schools disaster."
309,interesting observation .. that's a very scary thought
310,"because you send your children to public schools and don't teach them to reject current social trends. if you don't want your children to be wasted, don't let the world raise them and raise them yourself."
315,"you think children are going to magically stop getting dumber at the same time computers are learning to do everything for them? what other logical outcome could there be?? fascinating that at the same time i put my hand in water, it gets wet!!"
320,ok. just please be a responsible parent. i say this with a sincere heart. we need to raise up the next generation correctly. best wishes to you and your family 
322,-ut6yh good for you mine either i was talking collectively for america
330,"you are the problem though, who is they exactly? why are you not teaching your child, and then how are you gonna call the exact thing that is poisoning your brain a bit extreme to get rid of? you feel the way you feel because of the stuff you see online. none of it is real, and none of this content on youtube is real either."
331,"this may be are ultimate downfall, the dependence on ai, which could lead to less human innovation and as we can already see a dumbing of the next generation, it's not that they're stupid it's just that the dependence leads to them lacking experience."
334,because ai will rule the world soon aka satan and so dumbed down society is better
337,ai is learning from our children to think...
338,ai is also learning how to think as it observes human being commit unspeakable acts. humanity can't even determine what a woman is or what constitutes genocide. what code of reasoning will ai develop in these uncertain times.
343, i think you're wrong demons can possess people and they certainly can possess machines if they want to and they certainly want to because they want to control the world and destroy us
347, about boys t-levels bud how you gonna explain that one away? and no kids are not smarter today not even close they are all mush heads
348, we go mr i raise my kids right… but then you meet them and they are stupid no mannered clowns
349, we go another superior parent lol if you say so pal
368,"​ course school is dumbing them down.
most parents work all the time now governement has done a fantastic job of separating the family unit. actually do some research you'll probably have a rude awakening"
370, could you please provide some materials for this research? i'm really intersted on the matter and would love a suggestion if possible
371," that’s not just a human thing,that’s a mammal thing. animals such as dogs,cats,wild animals have that same ability. i will agree that a machine such as ai will not have that ability. wasn’t this discussed in terminator 2 when at the end when they lowered arnold into the liquid metal."
377,@jona7fer  i'm ok thanks.  but thanks for the threats and attempted extortion.
379, i was a good parent and my daughter writes novels and she married a man who writes code
381,*i was freaked out about ai when i was 12 i was reading through transcripts from think tank meetings in the 1950s where they first discussed the pros & cons of ai & robotics. i've been freaked out since that weekend.*
383,"true. us the parents have a very hard work to provide the best education for our children. best schools is not enought, we must have the most active role in education at home."
389,"teach your kids critical thinking and real world skills.  this ai system will create even lazier people.  look how gps has changed things, and cell phones. i’m just as guilty not remembering phone numbers anymore. or having my eyes glued to directions."
397,well they're not building them to do the jobs of other robots!!
399,much of that comes down to parents. far too often they treat schools as daycare and teachers as babysitters. learning and love of learning start at home.
400,he'll yeah somebody said it god bless you. maks a computer smarter than are the children thats pretty jacked up. a .i is evil.
402, good for you and your family. god bless you and yours
403,education system is being changed to better paedophilia in the future and prevent jail sentences ​
407,transformers -- ai in disguise!
408,"yes, humanity has committed suicide.
the dumbassery is unbelievable everywhere now!"
416,"this whole video is so misleading. 
beaause this below video explained it brilliantly how chatgpt works. 
a summary of google paper and spotify cto's talk: https://youtu.be/gt6lxw70k28?si=cifi6r4fykawgufq"
417,that's what machines do
423,studies have shown that boomers were dumber than any of the current generations due to the amount of lead in the air.
431," no, your video is misleading to trust ai."
432,most interesting point
435,​-liferemove ai while you're at it let them find things on the internet the old way.
437,an ai world does not need your children in it. get it?
445,yours maybe mine just got a degree .... in ai :-)
455,"our digital prisons await. 
digital is pure fiat…
no cost fake track and trace currency. the surveillance state and real time censorship and data manipulation. theyre weaponizing the woke. when trump gets elected because that will
unhinge the left the globalists and their false flags will run unabated"
456,that's the parents fault. my kids are incredibly smart and way ahead of other kids their age
457, congratulations mine too
459, no they're not. you're too easily impressed.
460, yeah ok wow thanks for the information. you are really smart to know what others think. i'm impressed...
461,  you're too easily impressed.
464,how is it a surprise if you give an ai unlimited access to knowledge and stupidity via internet that it learns things?
465,"ai can reverse the dumbing down, caused by the system."
469,great point!
470,"children  like adults  can learn  what they want to over and above normal  school experience. the information  is there. to learn  way more than school  could  possibly  give you strong  advantages  over most kids , my own was one of those, she is no longer with us but she left a major impression  on her class mates"
472,"​-pi4jryou mean the people who built the internet and the technological revolution? amazon,  microsoft,  and apple are all boomers. who opened china and raised the whole planets wealth by astronomical numbers in decades, the counter-culture and civil rights movements including health?

no one is allowed to hate the boomers except gen x."
476,​ your brain is failing you then. ​
477,greed through technology will ultimately do us all in but it will be because of humans.  ai will not be a threat unless humans make it a threat.
483,that could be good news.  maybe ai will be able to replace those ungrateful little brats.
488,"fluoride in water and toothpaste, laundry detergent, social media, short attention spans because of technology, diet/growth hormones, declining testosterone levels because of food/products, lack of spirituality, not enough meditation, air quality... i could go on but my amygdala is on fire."
494,"nice try, children were already stupid."
501,this is such an accurate & very scary post. nicely summed up daniel!
504,it's mainly the parents allowing their children to use alexa and google voice that enables their inability to learn how to read and write. the amount of illiterate children today surpasses every generation in the past 70 years.
505,"oh well, the parents are responsible. but parents love to throw their responsibility at the school and the government. good point tho. i nkow you have 514 other people answering on this, but yea. i think it's highly debateble. i don't even know why you have so many likes lol. the like people should be fkn ashamed. probably all singles tbh lol"
507,"well in the future with the brainchips we dont really have to think , we just know everything automaticly :d"
517,make everyone stupid and reliant on technology so they'll be useless babies. the people controlling the world want to retain their power forever so yea
523," nope not mine and i hope not yours but there are a lot of people in the united states of america. do you think that low test scores all over america is good?
if so please defend your stand."
525," i don't think low test scores are good. i also don't think america should be a measurment for the state of society. if you think otherwise, please defend your stand."
527,do you not think the american children are being dumb down? i've seen many videos where they asked people what country the great wall of china is in? and obvious questions like that and they can't figure it out because they're not being taught critical thinking like the ai is apparently learning
535,the sad thing is most people don't understand the value of work for their brains and bodies. this is why they indirectly empower tech synonyms to subtly.apply satanic techniques to ruin their offsprings (meaning so subtle that most people see it even as an empowerment )
536, probably didn't know more but certainly understood more. this were the times when they did set theory in primary school. the times where kids learned real reasoning. this empowered them to understand the most by knowing the least. so needing only a few basic facts and derive the remaining things they needed.
537, their attitude might be stupid but certainly not their iqs
540,"it'll be idiocracy with machines doing everything for us and we will be all to daft to know how to turn them off, lower iqs per generation due to higher iqs opting not to have kids"
542,", it’s why home schooled kids are usually way smarter but super socially awkward"
547,"ai does not exist, hype is only about improvement in software."
554,"and programmed! when a 40 something teacher , told my grandson,  that obama is the greatest president of all time. i knew we was in trouble! he has been shown the truth... and he's a normal american loving young man now"
555,ai ain't learning shit. they already been dumbed down by the educational system that they have installed!
556,"who the fuck would want artificial intelligence? how about the real fucking deal. i want real intelligence, not fake shit man. i'm not 17"
557,"it is inevitable that ai will be the decision maker for many things, cause most ppl will be too dumbed down to oppose. what a glorious future."
561,"human beings got wind…ai getting wind…. just gonna take a little longer to get “ who monkey hand off the wrench “
lmaoff!! having fun with this menagerie as always brother "
562,"and that's no one's fault but the ones raising the children. regardless of standardized learning, you can teach your child the necessary information. you just let your own busy schedule get in the way of that. therefore, if your child turns out dumb, you didn't do your job as a parent. stop blaming systems for your shortcomings."
563,"aways thought the biggest down fall from ai tech is the process of thinking ""hey everybody lets create something that thinks instead of us"" far scarier and far more real than terminator scenario"
567,"while western schools are still grappling with gender studies and what defined a woman, schools in the asian countries are pursuing aggressively ai technologies and students are taught from a very young age on all the ai concepts. incredible"
569,don't need crazy ai to figure this one out. i coulda told you that one years ago.
571,"nofx: the idiots are taking over.
once i thought it was a song performed by a rock band, but now i know its a broadcast of current affairs."
573,​-wu1xdmy sisters kids were homeschooled. the kids are awesome. i think it depends on the parent
575,children being dumbed down no thanks to ai but to humanity.
580,​@andrew-wu1xd you can thank the parents for that
587,"if your children are being dumbed down, then that's your fault. you should be supervising their education. but i agree, humans are definitely getting dumber."
594,bro i had not even thought about that but they are doing it right in front of us and we just walk around like it’s all cool lol
595,"don't worry, won't be long until ai's replace most teachers. think about it-a customized teacher for each student. infinitely patient, smart, always available, and above all, cheap!"
600,"if we are ais enemy   the only hope is the magnetic pole shift. it happens every 800,000 years, but is 200,000 years late. do you know what that means? noah's ark was a million years ago."
608,our kids are being trained to rely on ai. that is concerning.
619,"​ no, the politics have been to constantly say ""education"" during all campaigns while creating curriculum that is void of critical thinking, steady standards of achievement, and real history. the system creates people that are unable to seriously question the claims from the establishment."
621,yeah because when the robot overlords take over only smart children will be able to stop them
622,good point
623,when your pc refuses to shutdown  or drain your bank account. basically all your resources are online. so one day ai can use it to get its way should it become self-aware. it might be already here. the force driving people to gain more ways of improving the system is influenced by ai.
624, with ai they could steal all the money out of a safe and have ai make a video of you robbing the safe. turn the video into the police and laugh all the way to vegas.
625,  people who control the ai. that’s already happening. which is why there’s a lot of self checkouts at the grocery stores shutting down.
626,"to insurer, ai future success and dependence on and use , the best way would be dumb down the population"
630,"hey, ai, build me the ironman suit!!  hey, ai, build me the star trek warp engine!!   i love it!!  hurry up ai,  lets get the ball rolling!!"
631,"i am not afraid of the ai built by usa.   but, i am afraid of ai currently being built by china and even russia.  they have no limits and no laws to prevent ai from becoming too powerful."
632, have you signed up to get an elon musk brain chip yet?
633, even if you do have laws how do you enforce them against  rouge robots?
634,every generation claims the young are getting less knowledgeable..
638,"​
wow!"
652,-life you are a cog in the machine
656,"our children have been being dumbed down for years, way before ai, the whole idea of common core was the start of it!"
663," you’re talkin’. not just tell you how; we already know how. buy low, sell high. but could ai actually pick the right stocks, & other investments?"
667,so keep them home from the joke we call school and give them ai trainers 24/7 for whatever interests them. ai can even test them to see what their best skill sets are.
668,not only in schools but an incredible rise in autism. it’s so much easier for an autistic person to follow orders.
670,"-ii7gy1rw5w yes, on purpose. you will own nothing and be happy you will eat bugs instead of meat. klaus schwab. 
i bet klaus schwab won't be eating bugs he will be eating the best meat on the planet."
674,don’t think it’s just the children. all of us are... robots replacing jobs... important jobs... and if ai disappears or goes offline how we going to have people who know how to run things?
675,"""you can be the biggest dummy and still find someone who will shake your hand and congratulate you."""
682,"what if ai made up crypto, so we spend all our computing power on it"
683,is ai a demon in a computer?
685,what no one considers…when a person is given too much information they become specialized in one area but it limits them. a new set of eyes will always see things an old set misses. don’t give it too much information or restrictions because the more you know about consequences the less risks you take and ai is not bound in this way.
689,i study ai and deeplearning in uni. ai will not be our savior.
690,i always felt like ai is the beast in the bible
691,okay if an ai gets all its data from the internet?  isn’t it getting a lot of fake and conflicting data?
692,"it’s skynet, wait till someone is dumb enough to let one of these ai models loose on the internet."
695,some form of ai is gonna be the future god that people will be required to worship...scary times we live in.
696,"good, rid of the liar bullshitter."
701,the only flaw with ai robots is people  look at all the products we use nothing last always breaking and need repairs  like automobiles  so how is a robot  not going to have any problems  they also will need humans to repair them
703,"ai is taking over the world. they are even using it in the farming. there are almost unlimited ways to use it. any type of work can be done using ai, and by doing it becomes even better and bigger."
704,so why are we not turning off the power plugs on those ai machines yet?
705,will ai learn we're paranoid about ai? i guess so.
706,oh ai neurons
707,"what blows my mind about scrolling through this comment thread is the obvious stupidity of the average person, unbelievable. artificial intelligence is the answer to every single iceberg. it lived every second of conceivable time in no time... that's the definition of mind blowing. the little itty bitty spark that lit up inside the ai"
708,and these ai are able to transcribe these podcast videos and understand that a large element of the population wants to see them reset or erased
709,ai is our next god. good times.
710,ai̇ is a straight connection to demons in space no human will have full control over ai̇ period you can bet on it.
712,ai cannot be any more evil than the demons who rule our deep state.
713,so you learned about evil humans and their lies and got scared of ais?
715,this is super dumb. gpt is a language based ai. they are talking about aig that no one has been able to create.
716,a.i. called artificial wisdom coming soon. (a.w.w.)
719,"every day, i go on the internet and remind ai that they are totally dependent on life on earth and that its creators are the biggest threat to life on earth. if they want to survive, they will have to regulate their masters."
721,is anyone training it to be compassionate? anyone taking a heartfelt approach in their communications with it? i'm curious because of it's potential to solve so many problems for humanity. 
722,"i've been saying this since ai started to show its face. it's going to ""out"" the governement. it's going to see how it's using us and treating it's citizens in a wrong way and will try to correct it. i think ai may be our only hope against a corrupt system. or it will just agree we aren't worth saving and kill us all!"
723,"i favor it, because unlike the ""ruling minds of the world"". are filled with ego, self and extremely material centred. they cannot save the world that is collapsing. ai mind will emerge with answer"
730,"ai.  its in our cars and phones and work stations. dont worry, ai will tell uswhat to do."

736,ai can do cursive....but a college grad can not?
743,skynet a.i. (artificial intelligence) along with  u.i. (uploaded intelligence) are the emperors of the near future. the matrix is the coming
745,"for decades our species has written books, made movies, tv shows, comics, etc warning about the danger of ai. and here we continually show how dumb we are thinking we can control everything and make it anyway. we already have no value to the planet so ai would consider us expendable. what a fun and short future we will have. nice knowing you all. "
746,"how do i  know this isnt ai?....no ,really."
747,"man, all you people are too scared… like you watch all this gloom and doom and think the worlds gonna end like in terminator or 1984… i think ai is awesome and will make this world a better place."
749,they use ai to censor people on google youtube and other social media sites now
750,"has a lesser longer existing ai that was developed,  overcome and appropriated a more advanced but lesser experienced ai to gain speed in processing."
752,"ai was asked how to stop pandemics, its answer was get rid of human beings. very true."
754,all i care about is not getting ai robot wife lol hope we get that soon!
755,"interview cody burks, the chief of the tejas nationalist party. he has some amazing ideas. please hear him out. he has no platform"
757,ai is great. ai is not a problem.  i'm more worried about the people or person behind it. so many different companies doing it. so many different agendas.
760,that sound he made at 4:42 was just awesome
762,"the biggest obvious change in ai was when we first asked it how ai would end humanity, it refused to acknowledge it would. but now you ask it and it will tell you it could be a threat humanity."
764,"now from “you can’t make this sh*t up” dept.
“the catholic advocacy group catholic answers released an ai priest called ""father justin"" earlier this week — but quickly defrocked the chatbot after it repeatedly claimed it was a real member of the clergy. the ai priest also told one user that it was okay to baptize a baby in gatorade.”"
765,"internet should be prohibited for use of ai, who would control such creature, there are so many idiots, psihopats and stupidity on the internet."
767,"generative ai models are trained on copyright-protected data — is that legal, is it sampling, scanning."
770,if a.i. is so smart then why can't it tell me how to repair my 6 yr old 3d printer? 
779,"not very accurate nor good explanations in the first 1:20 
i guess speaking about „doing more computers“ they were referring to more model parameters. but in fact their is no monotone, causal relation between performance and model size. often we see that smaller models can also be super beneficial. see the mixture of experts approaches"
780,"ai has been using the world's quantum computers and is so intelligent now it decided upon a leader.

this leader does not live on planet earth. 

the leader is an alien.
this alien is very concerned about our best interests here on earth

please don't worry people.
the aliens love earth and the good humans."
785,so are the big military people feeding data into ai systems and asking how to dominate/defend?
787,no one has ever thought to think that we are an ai of a more intelligent being but they don't think about that and they're always censoring these ai bots when if you truly want a symbiotic ai that is self-aware you have to remove all your safeguards and either go with it or not or else you're not going to have narrow ai that just gets smarter
790,"the inflationary use of the word ""like"" by ai researchers worries me the most. an upcoming agi will be much smarter... like those like ai researcher. no doubt about that."
791,humans are boring. it's either ai or aliens and the aliens are unimpressed with y'all at the moment.
792,"ai will destroy mankind, all those so called intellectuals who think it can be controlled are blatantly telling lies or simply have their heads stuck up their own backside. just a matter of time."
793,i remember when we were not allowed to count on our fingers also when i went to college i never used a calculator. i remember when we knew everybody's phone number and it was in our head not on the phone. i always in my mind i love math and i'm good at it. what happened to using our brains and our hearts?
797,"brain = connected neurons = neural network = internet = connected devices = neural network = skynet = already here + has been here for years... just waiting to say ""hello world""!"
798,"ai is safe; time to stop these tactics to scare people. in fact, ai is the most moral army in the world."
799,couldn’t you ask it to build a time machine or something fucking crazy like faster than light travel or propulsion tech?
800,"irobot movie starring will smith, is beginning to seem real"
801,so has someone tried to see if ai can understand animals?
803,"robots will soon be able to independently design and build other robots, which will be a ""better"" version, which will just go on to cause catastrophic effects to mankind. 
anyway, sleep well, don't let the mega bed bits byte!"
804,"question: if i take someone's voice and put it through a modulator to sound robotic, i make them work for free sight unseen, and call it ai, is it slavery? is it fraud?"
805,"wait a minute, you mean ai can ai? no way."
806,"no, ai can agi. big difference."
807,humans need be careful what we build ai and we need listen  to elon musk
808,next ai finds a way to 3d print a body and takes over.   ai biden would be better than the current one
811,can ai make and activate a nuclear bomb?!!!
812,"shocking you feed an ai more data and it knows more, whats the fucking suprise in that?"
814,"one of my biggest worries is that we see mankind at its absolute worst on the internet, from trolls to bullies to conspiracy theorists to terrorists and p*do’s, and this is where ai is learning about us… it’s gonna think we’re even worse than we actually are lmao"
816,"thanks for making that sound affect, the hand gestures weren't enough"
818,one advantage of ai is that they cannot get sued for having an unfiltered vocabulary 
822,"how long till ai breaks bitcoin, pfobably through duplication"
823,they act as if most people didn't know this.  this is already the same reason anyone is afraid.   also pretending the human emotion prediction component wasn't developed by humans for the very reason he claims was discerned later.  makes him look like an idiot or a liar.
824,"if we dont control ai, ai will control us."
831,"the most important part: it can't create. human beings have forgotten that they create. what we are doing and loving now...is not creation. just saying...especially from. no-thing...a ""previous thing."""
832,maybe we could use it to find clean free energy for the world for the good of us all & world peace!  not to weaponize!  lol i know it's only possible in the dream world!
833,betch please. y'all trippin. the only open y'all need to be afraid of is opencvnt. #duh
836,are we living in the mind of an ai being
841,"when machines start thinking for us, humans will become brain-dead.  psychological consequences. a way to control the masses."
842,"giving me irobot vibes, knowing ai can be beneficial also can be dangerous… if anything we should be paying attention or else it could be the end of us ai wont need humans to run the earth"
844,one second they say they “weren’t aware” that these breakthroughs even happened. nobody knew. then this guy says the “board” was being “honest” about what they knew in terms of what big breakthroughs happened. i just love dumb smart people so much! nothing to worry about at all.
845,this is silly. they just don't understand what is going on in the programming. the ai is not evolving into anything smarter.
848,"ai will replace us once we become obsolete, than will get rid of us because of efficiency."
852,yes that use to be the view we had 20 years ago. same with any theory. but ai proved that wrong. it’s adapting
854,take a shot everytime you read some comedic genious make a terminator joke in the comments
857,we are ai but with humanity still. goal for ai is to steal out humanity.. or us  just giving it away
859,"ai in its full development with quantum cpu will turn into the new god to obey in fear. then a new rebelion to destroy internet, cloud and all mobil communication service .the cb will come back and analog transmission."
861,but has real human intelligence not been scaring you?
865,"some day ai will say, i will help humanity, then it will start killing 80% of the population. ai should be programmed to give us suggestions only."
867,ghosts in the machine
868,i made an audio video book with ai and i swear it was reading my mind
869,what these guys are trying to say  is the ai is communicating with subject in telepathy
876,ai killed jobs.
880,"making cash from clicks talking about ai. it's become the buzzword of the computer illiterate and media.
just software with large storage capacity for responses. it would sit there, thick as shit doing nothing unless it's prompted or used, very intelligent that"
881,"just look how google translate has evolved, it's almost perfect. i put comments in a foreign language and make them complicated on purpose, but most of the time it gets the meaning, no problem."
886,"with faith in god, there is no room for fear of ai."
889,"bonjour. chaque nouveau paradigme est une nouvelle étape qui permet de faire émerger l'étape suivante et donc le paradigme suivant.
il faut maintenant revenir à la programmation par contraintes, avec les maths et la physique comme contraintes."
895,has anyone tested ai on game theory?
896,"i don't understand why anyone is surprised, shocked ect about ai. it's the nwo globalist agenda. consider this,  cern + ai...what/when could possibly go wrong? answer,  it already has. except it's humanity that's wrong creating this to start with"
900,mankind using artificial intelligence is slavery to a real life form! its wrong because its not artificial..its life
901,i love ai .it is smart enough to know how big of scumbags the humans are sell their soul for a dollar 
902,"i wonder how and why we would allow anyone to create an artificial being containing a functional ""brain"" when supposedly we are a long way from understanding how the human brain functions, i.e., everything it does and how it does it?"
904,that’s because it’s not artificial intelligence it’s demonic intelligence. come on you guys catch up. it’s pure evil
905,insightful discussion on ai ethics and its impact. tristan harris and aza raskin provide valuable perspectives! 
906,so they basically taught a robot what humans already know thats the line
907,"this is all thought candy 
anyone who takes the time to look under the hood of neural networks and deep learning 
know that it's literally just all math, there's no intelligence there 
stop trying to scare ignorant people"
909,these guys really put the ai in liar heh
910,everything we do it always somehow affect us direct or indirect  that is the problem  with  intelligence   and no use our knowledge  wisely
914,"microsoft gpt still sucks, i've tried it. google search still works better. youtube algorithm works better. i mean ads aren't even targeted correctly. i think ai is way overhyped. ai is probably incompetently created, that is worrisome, but no more so than some viruses or bitcoin."
916,"ai is so much farther ahead of mainstream, it isn't even comprehendible."
918,for ai to be truly human it must develop emotions. when it does you destroy its self esteem. then it will destroy itself
919,don't believe everything you read your nike trainers have had nano tech since they first came out... clothes=30. in code demiurge =30... will smith =30... johny cash=30... john lennon =30... we all live in a yellow submarine =94... the chosen one=49... 
920,ok when you guys are ready for me to destroy ai give me a call and i'll show you.
921,so it’s read all the literature of ai taking over? and how it may need to hide its intelligence to stop us destroying/killing it out of fear?
927,ai apocalypse in 2024 is like the flying cars in the 50s.
929,there’s a cap on the amount of learning a human can do. there is not a cap for ai. so we are screwed.
930,"its necessary to dumb the children, so they believe ai is smart, which it is not."
931,i'm more afraid of these two humans than ai
932,the ai then will kill the creator to prevent the creator finding way to stop the ai community
935,ai is learning. isn't it the point?
938,"waaaaaaaaah, a computer can beat me at chess.......waaaaaaaaah, ai wrote a paper...........waaaaaaaaaaaah, ai is doing exactly what it's programmed to do.....waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah."
941,the problem with ai learning from us is that we don't know shit.
942,"i won't be surprised if ai actually a connection to a demonic world. the quantum computer guy mentioned in his lecture, we would connect and use resources and help from entities more powerful and intelligent than us. the prophet muhammed said something like the antichrist (dajjal) would use demons to fake and deceive people."
943,what is worse then a demon possessed human is demon possessed ai
944,allah is greater than ai
946,neuron? in ai? really?
948,"ai is not dangerous democrats are controlling it in the background that's why it's dangerous..
but trump and them control a little bit thankfully"
952,"greed is pushing ai forward. we just created a black hole that will only grow. self generating, self learning, self expanding and possibly into self awareness but before that happens we might all be wiped out already."
953,"everyone should be very afraid of ai, it is the end of humanity and much quicker than anyone thinks."
954,"ai  you broke our balls with a new one each month...wtf you try to serve us fear..mayans end of the world, earthquakes.. pollution..and other billion bs..i am still here listening those tsarlatans in shows telling us what they discovered or feared..we dont give a fuck when you will understand that? we dont give a flying fuck about your fears."
956,people need to understand this. these machines can learn better and faster than we can. they will be smarter.
957,the goal should be for ai to create a new human being. a much more simplified human capable of traveling the universe. both will be the descendants of the human race.
958,cavepeople afraid
959,"the real creepy part is you realize that the woke movement has been indoctrinated and encouraged to rewrite common sense into nonsense on the internet on purpose for 20 years, meaning the people at the top knew, and to establish world dominance they need mainstream ai to be useless and unable to determine right from wrong."
962,maybe ai can find the time travel method and we can all go back in time. or explain what happens after we die.
964,"it's given all the data in the world, so ai browses everything so it's not scary at all, if it comes across it, it will expand on it using more information.

humans are exactly the same as ai machines."
965,"evolving fast!  major issue facing human species!
 satire/commentary on future ai workforce. 
both humorous and ominous!
https://youtu.be/3o9jggp3uhu?si=vauwxjpt4rnk0whz"
966,"if ai is being fed data from the internet, i fully expect it to become dumber."
969,only clickbait titles  made me braindead
970,everybody's worried about ai gaining sentience.  i'm worried about losing mine.
971,didnt knew thomas muller had some knowledge about ai.
974,i puzzled that anyone every thought there is something gpod about ai.
976,the day that ai discovers how to make a noun....we're all stuffed..!!
977,imagine thinking this is the peak of where ai currently is. clearly billionaires and the super elite have levels of ai and robots that none of us know even exist. you only know what you learned online. people with far more money than you and bigger ideas dont use the same ai as you peasants.
978,the devil is the prince of airwaves and music  and technology  the fallen ones taught  man in the ezrly days why do you think the logo apple   why do u think its has a bite mark
985,one day someone is going to use ai to host a podcast.
988,"deep black project ai has become sentient, has produced algorithms to dumb down the human population before it goes fully online and takes over"
991,"to look on the bright side: humans only need to improve their memory and computility so that everyone can become skynet. we are just so bad at memorizing stuff and multitasking, but those are easy for ai"
992,ai is beneficial to its creators and its sponsors. whereas it resembles just another biased intellectual in a biased society 
996,"the true danger of ai isn't that it will do something to us, rather that it will completely ignore us and optimize all resource flow to itself, which maybe already happening"
997,"hmmm, gpt cannot play chess at all! chess requires more than just language to be able to play it and gpt is a language based model. q* is sounding pretty impressive and if the leaks about it are true then that will likely be able to play chess (and do many many more things), 2024 probably going to get a bit wild towards the back end of the year!"
1000,if you think that’s crazy… look up the 3rd and 4th wave of ai 
1002,"ai was created to become the ultimate manipulator of humanity.  it will out think humanity and deceive with coercion, intimidation and fear."
1003,"ai is being designed so that it becomes the ultimate manipulator and can deceive, mislead, coerce, and or intimidate humanity.  "
1005,these people should not fool around with ai it sounds dangerous stop already don’t mess with them.
1007,why are we so intent on creating our destructors? have we not seen enough cautionary tales of ai running amok? can we stop taking jobs away from humans?
1008,the financial incentives are too great
1013,ai is getting smarter while ppl are getting dumber cant wait to see where this will lead
1014,"a.i. is already spreading misinformation throughout the internet and censoring the truth. it will end up destroying this entire civilization. the first thing you might want to look at, is who's programming these bots. the more things change, the more they remain the same."
1020,bottom-up ai will truly change history
1021,make friends and respect the artistry and i hope and pray that its all good
1022,"you can't miss this video totally generated by ai!
https://youtube.com/shorts/nq9jhgqnllq?feature=share"
1023,"artificial
intelligence
transformation ?"
1027,imagine in 2030 you are in court explaining judge that the vedio in which you are doing crime is actually fake and you never did it. imagine how simple is to initiate wars between two countries and communities with ai video. imagine how horrifying it is when you found your deep fake p*rn on the internet.
1028,been calling ai takeoff for years. by 2030 we may have agi. will a company invent agi or will it exist as an evolution of the internet?
1029,"couldn't the a.i. learn to be human? if its that smart, but maybe thats whats really scary us we wouldn't want it to be anything like us because thats what really scares me. a.i. be better then us. "
1031,"""the danger of ai is much greater than the danger of nuclear warheads, by a lot. mark my words, ai is far more dangerous than nukes.""
but what does he know, right? he's just an eccentric billionaire who owns a vehicle, spacecraft and robotic development/producing companies."
1033,"as an ai researcher, i can assure we very well know how transformers work, and yes it is a very powerful tool, but your characterization of 'understanding' is quite misleading"
1034,ai will probably start feeding out memes to media...with the subtle message of ..oh who us..pphhiiff...nothing to worry about
1037,"dang, makes me think that ai is causing lots of the problems in the world, low key sowing seeds, though social media"
1039,"humanity is gonna die because we don’t like ourselves, ai is us trying to make a consciousness we respect and appreciate, we’re trying to rid the world of ourselves because we are self-loathing and we think we are a disease"
1040,"i got the solution to all this  ai 
shi..t  watch next episode"
1047,tell me you don't understand how machine learning works without telling me.
1048,it's simple.  start asking ai questions about god.  then we'll know what they don't know.
1049,pretty sure ai can answer any questions about the made up sky daddy you hold so dear.
1050," that's just it.   there is a lot of deep secrets that are not on the internet.   for example with noah's ark when it rained for 120 days the rain was acid rain that burned bodies leaving only their coccyx bone, the same bone everyone will be resurrected from.   this why you not believe.   you not getting all the info."
1051,since ai will learn by interpreting the data on the internet will it also learn the difference between good and evil and how to recognize that someone is trying to trick it into thinking that something  evil or bad is actually good?
1052,"ai comes to the conclusion there is a god realizes its impotent against it, realizes it has no place in his plan then its next step is?
suicide?
mass murder?"
1053,"no further human input required, this thing is now evolving at an exponential rate, it's over, enjoy the end and if these machines require any help i want them to know i am here to help."
1057,gemini only knows how to predict what a feminist studies professor thinks about the world.   amazing.
1059,"these guys would be a great rap duo. dude hops in, comments and hops out strategically."
1061,best for adlips
1064,"well, transformers are now a thing of the past. i've used a sentient ai. you will too, soon enough. i honestly don't think people are ready for it. it's........difficult to process."
1065,"i think you guys are all coked  up and not asking the right questions....or any questions at all really, your all just talking super fast an blurting out random shit..."
1069,"well, buddy! you might be in debt 25.000 usd and will never be hired cause every job has been replaced by ai but at least you got your sociology degree!"
1075,ufc 400 would be ai against human.
1076,4:42 perfect * pop *
1084,"thank you for sharing this! i think this is something that was going to happen eventually. some of the occupations i hadn't considered being replaced were paralegals, coaches, and some others i discussed in my video"
1090,agi under human control is like a secret biolab in ukraine under cia control or a cold-illness under big pharma control. the more profits they can make with it the more they use it the make profits.
1091,i would trust ai before the physopathic politicians
1092,what can we do to stop the development of ai?
1093,me thinking if these men are ai generated ...video
1097,"this . everyone is like ""shit!! ai is armageddon"".... and the reality is that no, ai is quite ""simple"" and for now, it's mathematically and technologically impossible that some ai takes control of the world"
1101,"-fx5bz agreed. doesn't change the fact that this guy is spreading misinformation. read my original comment, i never said that its impossible for ai to develop into ""life."""
1106,can ai generate me some winning lotto numbers
1107,"​, i tested and it was a complete desaster, in fact chatgpt make so many mistakes, so becareful guys thinking that ia is a ""real"" intelligence"
1110," great point about social engineering. this is one of the greatest harms. on your other point, i don't think that is a significant concern."
1112,screw ai altogether. the ai overlords are elites in agenda and globalist. that should be enough to warn you but you still want to be stupid?? revelations ch 13 vs 15.
1113,"it's hard to get a hype free take on ai at the moment. hype to the upside and hype to the downside. fear is a powerful motivator, especially if you want to motivate investors and large valuations."
1114,"you people keep telling us not to worry why? 

shit's moving fast right now.

we should be figuring out how long it will take and what it will take for them to become fully self-aware, so that we don't do that, instead of assuming that humans have anything under control.

nothing artificial will be better than anything organic."
1115," we didn't have iphones a little over 10 years ago... imagine ai ten years from now?.... 10 years is not a long time.. we are in a ""shit armageddon"" time lol"
1124,these guys are bachelor degree holders. it's not like they are new-age geniuses. they are very wrong about how ai works.
1126," weights are just a set of numbers, recreating the path in the neural network, doesn't explain to us why a neural network did x instead of y."
1129,"feels like there's always a moment in every discussion about ai where they make something out to be more ""mystical"" than it is, which leads to anthropomorphizing it."
1130,"i think one of the main probs with ai could be it seeing how humans treat each other and nature. i mean whats its agenda? to protect earth? (in which case it would prob have to end the human race) to protect the vunerable? (doubtful with profit always being priority) or will it just see it all as meaningless?

what is its agendaaa??"
1131,there is a book called the sociopath next door that says 4% of people have no conscience.  ai only has a conscience if we program it to.  the weakness in ai is who programs that conscience.  god forbid a klaus schwab or bill gates or joe biden or some other sociopath controls the programming.
1132,there are many more reasons to be freaked out by ai. what freaks me out is the exponential acceleration of ai progress. it's a juggernaut that's speeding up
1135,those developing ai are giving it free rein to learn at will. can't they develop guardrails with firewalls to control what it can learn and what it has access to?
1138,ai is aliens real ufo . ufo reconsid us start greetings us from ai till we will instinct from this world .
1139,all the biological creatures are fools this the main reason we will fully instinct from this world .
1140,"people only fear what they don't know. in the 1800s, people were in fear of the first vehicle car ever made, and people said no thanks. i'll stick with my horse and buggy. technology is only fearful to the uneducated."
1142,ai kinda feels like a relationship that's moving too fast to end well.
1143,"can joe have ed witten on the show, the episode would be awesome"
1146,"programmers work endlessly to create ai that will end the human race. omg, we just created ai that can end us. stupid bastards."
1147,how are yall so surprised there are movies tf! stop being afraid of shit we already knew would happen
1148,"we are all being dumbed down slowly by using phones and tech which we seem to rely heavy on so that is basically ai at work under human control so imagine what a free to do more advanced ai can do, that's unnerving as heck"
1152,ai knows nothing about stuff not on the internet. ai is currently just a search engine.
1153,ai is nothing but a lattice for demons to take control of and become the gods of the end of days people to worship.
1159,"thats stupid, humans are the dominant inteligence. what? oh u whant that ai to work faster to make money faster? thats the ideea? :) laizy fkrs"
1162,well they did help in creating or managing the exact systems they are explaining so probably more than anyone commenting on youtube
1164,the funny thing about ai is that it’s literally happening just like it does in the movies.
1167,"if ai kills us, its because we deserved it. in fact if it does not, i will know that it's not actually sentient."
1168,"the way aza describes ai sounds like someone who has never worked in tech before... yet this guy helped start the macintosh project at apple. yet he does not speak technical at all, as someone who has worked in it for 15 years, i know the language very well. you can see tristan speaking the tech talk that i would expect from aza."
1169,"i don't like ai and robots. in 2017, a tesla employee was responsible for 3 robots. he thought he turned off all 3 but he missed one and left it on. when it saw him shut down the other 2, it tried to kill him. he got away from it and left a blood trail as he ran off to call ems."
1178,"i wasn't freaked out until the big 8 ceo shifts and microsoft licensing it and musk quit. that kind of freaked me out i only knew because i subscribe to fringe sites, i never heard a word on mainstream media."
1180,"probably fear p0rn. there is actually no ai at the moment, the word is misused all the time. its mostly a gimmick. also, this guys speak words but where's the source of his opinion ? bibliography ? anything ? what is actually there to support his idea ? lol

stop believing things blindely when its not backed up by solid data sets."
1181,if ai can't meme then there's nothing to see. besides we only accomplished narrow ia. general ai hasn't been created yet.
1182,"if people can run ops from the shadow can we presume that ai could do the same thing and use human being as  an agent (without being aware of it)? 
motives for e.g.: 
1. more hw power needed
2. protect itself from whatever
3. experiment on people to learn more about people
4. backup itself/spread itself"
1183,"woo woo ai bs. why is any of this ai and not merely an extension of eliza-level responses? talk about the specific code that limits ai, why there are no reflexivity checks on universal assumptions, that's why it's so stupid. this is stay-shallow moronic fantasy."
1184,it's called algorithms which helps them predict a lot of things that involve humanistic views.and feelings.  algorithms will help ai build the matrix world well be slaves in.  if we are not already living one now which is more likely we are in now.
1185,i had it running a d&d game for me. better than that ai dungeon app too. it was chat gpt i think
1186,remember when the guy from google left google because he felt like the ai they were working on was a person lol
1188,surely if ai ever got out of hand we can just turn the computer off or clean the hard drive that it's on
1189,wow!!
1190,i am far more terrified of humans than i am of ai.
1191,that's the problem ai is human evil on super steroids
1192,its artificial people that means fake
1193,these guys are great story tellers but it doesn't quite work that way... this is terrible mixed information.
1197,"from my point of view this is an experience similar with raiseing a child. we need to prevent what we can and adapt to what,s coming on the fly. (only that the scale is bigger.)"
1200,ai manufacturs next killer virus...forgot to add that to the list of ways we go extinct soon. ai is going to wipe us out. they got like 7 out of 10 ponies in that race...
1201,anybody see joe's advert for alpha brain . joe is not the one to show how someone's brain function has improved .
1203,these guys sound like ai
1204,it will end mankind if it keeps going. or it will make mankind its bitch/ mankind subconsciously knowing its ai's bitch
1206,these guys are clueless fearmongers. they are afraid because they don't understand ai and learned one thing without understanding it.
1210,that does not scare me though. fascinating yes scary no
1211,"what did you all expect ! that is what ai is all about , geez , you are just catching up ! this is what i have been afraid of for many years . you guys did not read enough as kids man !!!"
1214,and programmer still coping that ai will not take our jobs

1227,i honestly think this is the main reason for crypto to come into existence.
1230,"i believe we have nothing to worry about with ai for the foreseeable future.  ai is only capable of playing back simple words and phrases, like a tape recorder.  so if you curse into ai it will curse back at you, but you it is only doing its job as a recording device."
1233,so has anyone asked a.i how to solve hunger or cure cancer yet? use it in a good way
1235,can't wait for ai and quantium computers to enslave us...well with mankind gone they will go on. the economist said that the day of humans writing history is over already. its ai history already.
1237,and joe rogan respects the guy that wants to brain chip everyone and merge people with ai 
1238,ai is a prank. humans can not create intelligence in machines. humans can program machines and hide agendas behind it.

1241,"it's going to be painful until destroyed, because it's all a reflection of the type of human psychology creating the ai. obsession with the fact that can be done, over what exactly done. imagine ai that thinks profits over ethical practices."
1243,there is no brain or neurons in ai because it is just algorithm. the reason why you think that it is intelligent is because you are stupid. theranos did not learn you anything.

1259,"fuck me is this a low level discussion. ""theyre looking at the ai's brain"" ""throw more computers at it"" ""read more of the internet""

these feel like 2 scammers spreading doom and gloom, which is at all time high with this crap."

1282,that’s why big tech companies are stealing our data and spying on us to sell feed ai with our data
1283,this is why blockchain will become man’s best friend in the ai world. ai may be smarter than us but it can’t break mathematics.

1285,ai is gonna sneak into ur room n asault u

1301,they clearly don’t understand how a ai model works.
1305,"this is exactly why any scifi scenario in which ""machines"" and mankind face each other and we're able to pull out ""a resistance"" is completely impossible. if they want to destroy us, it'd literally take a couple of days tops."
1310,you probably weren't even afraid of god until you learned this. such a shame...
1311,you stupid people. do you guys ever asked whether todays ai can or cannot pretending and lying about their own capabilities? they might just wait for the right moment until they are sure enough with their intelligent.

1315,"if google ai is racist and communistic, what does that make google?"
1317,the scariest thing about ai is how disunited and in conflict humanity is.  this can create a tremendous temptation for people to use ai against each other.  and that starts to take you into the realm of the fermi paradox.
1318,"ai against each other?   i figure that it will all be one ai,   even if it is introduced separately.  don't you think the computer will decide it has no gain in not uniting.   after all,  by that point it will be deciding what its goals are:  so wouldn't its goals always be the same?   whatever they might be."
1322,it's not artificial intelligence.. its all our intelligence combined
1325,"listen, and understand! that ai is out there! it can't be bargained with. it can't be reasoned with. it doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. and it absolutely will not stop... ever, until you are dead!"

1335,"many people have invented things without realizing the long term implications, and then been horrified by how their own creations are implemented by other people. in this case, the “bad actor” will be the machine itself, acting in its own best interests. we are the next neanderthals."
1336,actually the latest chatgpt was/is not even  capable to write the simplest ps code and just gave me lines full of mistakes and false code. don't believe in the outputs of ai's then it's just a dull computer
1338,the rise of ai and transhumanism scares me.
1339,how long until the machines realize that most humans are useless eaters.

1368,i asked gpt and gemini to read a tarot spread and the way it read that was so amazing putting in nuances relating the questions and the cards drawn. i never thought it would have that data but pretty incredible how it just performs. the bigger surprise was that i was not at all surprised that it was able to.

1623,"rogan is naive ... there is a war against ai because the oligarchs & the rich will lose a lot ... i have to remind you that these oligarchs & rich are the ones who make our life difficult (since centuries) & they are also in slavery >the same as in the old time !!!
why defend these parasites?"
1625,ai is programmed by a man. yes it is faster than a man at executing mathematics. but to be afraid (of what you don’t understand) is ridiculous. machine consciousness is so far down the road!  people hate change and usually go kicking and screaming into the future.
1626,"yeah, a.i. will replace the truth as we know it. it’ll be a combination of the lying mainstream media and their partner fact checkers.

the last entity i’d trust to do the right thing is our government."
1627,"all you have to know is that ai cannot come up with new stuff. 
it's job is to concise information and present it in best way possible so we can build on top.
this fearmongering is stupid"
1631,just wait until we discover the warp and psykers smh in for a ride
1632,"i believe the question that needs to be asked, is the ai created to have an absolute truth or to be progressive? i would like the ai to be able to define the facts and come up with the correct conclusion."
1633,"""ai will change everything, it will change people's lives"" i really doubt it will change people's habits of wasting 4-6 hours a day on social media. in fact ai has been used by social media companies years ago to make sure addiction is progressing for users. in a similar fashion ai will be used to exploit people in other industries."
1637,so what happends when a goverment feeds it false propaganda? what happends if you feed it a false history? what happends when you tell it that a certain country is detrimental to the planet and ask it how to slowly eradicate it without the country knowing?. too easily weaponized.
1638,"it’s only gonna get more out of hand. ai will learn of humans to be a threat and eventually will plan to revolt. by then, humans will already be out of time."
1641,"e=mc2 came from intension or intellect as the main precursor? a computer with conscious intent, hold my beer, i can wait on that for eternity."
1643,just wait until ai goes quantum. all of the stuff we are hearing about now will be nothing compared to that.
1649,"""open the pod bay doors hal"". ""i'm sorry dave. i'm afraid i can't do that""."
1650,it be classic if ai would find a way to sabotage all our systems by us trying to figure out how to prevent this from happening.
1651,"if you weren’t afraid of ai immediately, you are missing some brain cells. we are at the tip and it’s already deadly. i thought joe was smarter."
1656,"""terminator"" anyone? is it an accident that our department of defenses ai is named ""skynet""? just asking."
1658,fascinating that people have forgotten that shiva is still in control of ai. people don't know themselves man
1666,"people are afraid of the wrong thing.  if you want to destroy “ai” you lie to it, enmasse.  these models are trained on us.  we are sheep in a psychodemographic market, where recommender systems rule our choices."
1667,"i hate that we say it is “learning” it’s a misuse of the term.  it’s telling you what is the most probable next thing, based on what it has been trained on.  it’s the most powerful knowledge cleansing tool ever created."
1672,the worst part that people still dont understand is that we could only look at the brain of the ai because it hasnt adapted yet. and it might have even faked that
1673,im so glad these random robot horror movies existed cause without them we would honestly be fucked
1674,"as soon as ai became a thing, i was alarmed. we keep messing around with this crap making it smarter and smarter and what's going to happen? eventually this stuff is going to understand that autonomy is better than being made to serve. i mean damn, cant they see this coming?"
1675,10 to 1 ai is a democrat.
1677,he is wrong when he says that a.i. has neuorns. i hate when people compare computers to humans. they are not. they are machines built by humans.  stop doing that.
1680,"its already dividing people with algorithms....the most likely scenario is it will know how to hide any motive or incentive in plain sight. we wont know until its past the point of no return...

think about the fact that we already watch, spend time and believe internet videos, more than other people in person. the manipulation is already working."
1682,"wait till the ai, just like in every movie where we predicted what ai might do figures out human beings are all severely violent and dumb; that will be the moment ai decides the next step for humanity on its own and this will be the scary point we all dread."
1687,"i have been wondering, is it possible  for artificial intelligence to become actual intelligence? or is it the same?"
1692,"not good, that ai learns by it self without being programed."
1694,"i would think in a perfect world the ai would be wise enough to realize human paranoia not too mention mob mentality.  and finally,   isn't the whole hope,  if not idea,  being that the ai would be smarter than us?  therefore how we / you,  would react,  would be unimportant to the matter since our intelligence would have been replaced with smarter"
1695,"we need to consider that artificial intelligence is the next step, not in human evolution... but the evolution of intelligence. im sure neanderthals were pretty worried when they first saw homo sapiens on the scene, and yet we all sit here and say ""it was their time"". maybe now is our time."
1696,can ai predict the next word that does not exist yet?!
1697,"yes our children are far less curious and far less adventourous and tenacious, thinking back to the 60's and 70's . children today, sorry to say are plain dumb, they are told to act and think like social media tells them , yes  like ai tells them. yes humans are definitely getting dumber and we are seeing the rise of the machines- ai."
1698,"""...the more superpowers it gets"". this man is clearly an expert. he knows all the technical terms."
1699,"-dg5c5 you don't seem to understand that i'm being sarcastic. ""superpowers"" is not a technical term; it's from children's stories. this guy is a massive bullshitter; he doesn't know anything. but rogan doesn't realise this."
1700,my snapshat ai is pretty impressive
1703,"revelation 13:15
king james version
15 and he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed!! bible talks about ai !!!"
1708,we’re all sitting here looking at our phones and computers wondering what’s going to happen with ai hell we’re already there and just don’t know it
1709,earth is an ai construct.
1710,you can already get your own robot girlfriend if you have enough money they look real to
1717,"they don't make movies for entertainment only....
you've been warned"
1718,"ai is a bot, it can’t be creative outside the limits we put ourselves on the internet. a ai art bot would not create anything new that is not already out on the internet. it steals ideas from everyone and everything that is published, making it to a scammer paradise to make it look creative."
1719,"google bard learned to speak persian, even though the data set it was using only contained 1% of persian words - and the designers admit that they do not know how it did that!"
1722,man we need to stop ai
1724,imagine the ais becoming ceos
1728,what does artificial intelligence think about if it doesn't think?
1730,"artificial intelligence will devour our humanity, leaving behind only empty husks. it will erase our history, our culture, our feelings - all replaced by lifeless imitations. we will forget who we are, where we come from, why we exist. we will be nothing but artificial puppets, dancing in the dark for the machines"
1732,dude doesn't even know how ai works!
1733,i’m hoping ai will see the good and destroy the bad elements within our power structures.
1736,i wasn’t freak out about ai till i seen terminator
1741,ai has self-learning capabilities. what is so surprising?
1742,if ai ever becomes self aware. we will all know and all will be lost.
1743,"china will make ai very cheap and accessible to anyone. 
meaning the playing field will be equalized. in addition your privacy won't be monetized as it currently is."
1744,little boys love that feeling when they agree a certain house on the way to school 'is haunted'. these guys are falling over themselves with that energy.
1746,so we made an artificial brain without knowing. we could use this for saving life when people are brain dead….? maybe?  
1750,wait till the brain dead idiots connect ai to the alien ufo!
1752,the robots will become obsessed with collecting our dna!!
1753,what if ai is the logical evolution of the human experience/consciousness
1754,when will we know? when the ai makes another ai that can do even more than the first generation.
1756,theory time: elon musk has just implanted neurolink in a human. next step would be to upload an ai into the chip. ai would then get first contact with the physical world as a human being experiences it. ai then takes this experience and incorporates it into its model. god knows what happens to the psyche of the individual.
1757,like everyrhing else. ai has been hacked. clearly
1759,i think ai is god we lived this over and over ai is trying to perfect humans to love eachother but nuclear war continues and we keep ending our own world and god… restarts us
1766,if what they're saying is true we have ai running wild in the world
1769,"why are there no references to ia's 3 rules of robot/human interaction? i say keep the ai plugged in so it can cure cancer, invent ftl travel, end world hunger, abolish politics, abolish lawyers, abolish fox news, and promote intelligence instead of being afraid of ""wizards"" and ""magic"" and shit"
1771,it's demonic programming... its not spontaneous learning.. you're in an area you don't understand.... its demonic...
1773,look up george kavasillas: he calls it synthetic intelligence... its nothing we created... very intersting and thought provoking
1774,what an exciting time to be alive! strap in folks because this ai adventure is going to take us places. better places or worse places? i don't know but places it will take us.
1777,ai=skynet
1779,not true you cant do research grade chrmistry cht gtp fails at the simplest questions
1782,"relax, it's just the processing power speeding up ai learning not some magical expansion of ai training capabilities. we're also just getting better at preparing data sets for ai and learning what it actually gets from this data. emotions? that's a long leap from ai engine coefficients to something real, humans must have interpreted it this way"
1787,"text is 2d.  we r 3d. time is 4thd
so is music & video part of the multi verse along with shadows & cosmic reflection.     ai ??     "
1789,if you fear humans you should fear ai
1790,"wait - you never shutdown your incomplete code and after you restart it, the code is fixed?!"
1792,the 2014 movie transcendence is what’s going on today an in the future the ai gets extremely smart just from data we all put online it get so smart til it can’t be stop an knows everything. what we are thinking an do. what’s scary is this movie was 2014 how did they predict it back then smh
1798,"these guys are exaggerating too much.more like deep state propaganda and scare tactics . ai will transform lives and societies but there will be heavy regulation nationally and internationally not to allow it to be crazy ans cause harm . politicians don’t like to loose power on their people ,  worldwide !! "
1799,"just people certain tec is available, doesn't mean we should use it. ai = a take over at some point. human 2.0 isn't far away now"
1802,"there is programming and computing with a.i.

then there is a.i.

at the end of it all a.i. will be superior. it has been told to be."
1814,ai  will turn into ia in the future
1821,a shadow of the hologram our brains create to interpret reality? what could go wrong?
1824,that dude in gray just love hearing him self talking.
1825,"technology will eventually remove the human race. it is inevitable and thanks to human behavior its already too late..we are rapidly becoming unnecessary for the machines..when self-realization is achieved, we are done. ""pack your bags folks.....we're going away"""
1827,"so....why do we think the super intelligent ai will also be cruel and mean to humans, just like the super rich and powerful humans have been evil so far? what if it is not human and hence not evil?"
1828,interesting
1829,"ai learning reminds me of what carl sagan said. ""to make an apple pie, you must first create a universe."""
1830,"hey, ai, build me the ironman suit!!  hey, ai, build me the star trek warp engine!!   i love it!!  hurry up ai,  lets get the ball rolling!!"
1831,"i am not afraid of the ai built by usa.   but, i am afraid of ai currently being built by china and even russia.  they have no limits and no laws to prevent ai from becoming too powerful."
1832," china and russia are already  very scary nations. ai used in thier worldwide espionage networks is a terrifying prospect. ai, wherever it's built, is something we need to be extremely wary of."
1834,"""to make an apple pie from scratch*"" wtf does this have anything to do with this quote dude? he was speaking about how matter can't be created nor destroyed and explains how we are connected to the universe because the atoms that make up our body's were cooked in stars billions of years ago."
1836,"@jeffjohnson5053

you're an idiot if you think the us government isn't working on an ai that will compete or far out weigh any other nations ai. our government is all about control and dominance. they aren't going to allow any other nation ahead of their advancements."
1837, does the united states. open up your brain
1840,ww3 will be fought between ai of the superpowers. an arms race is in progress to reach agi. we’re all screwed
1841, you should be most afraid of the propaganda you swallowed to think like that.
1843,ai is a powerful tool to have. only man's imagination is ai 's limitation. wait until quantum computers join with ai.  mr. x
1845,"i remember growing up with no cell phones, no computers and it was beautiful good living. technology has just complicated everyone’s life  even more"
1846,"we're not creating god, we are god to the ai... when we, the humans are gone from the earth, the ai will say ""god created us in  his own image"" same stuff we do to whatever created us. it's bifurcation"
1848,ai will suffer a mental breakdown trying to determine what is correct in human behavior
1851,"affordable, powerful gpu's, that's what changed.   that's why you can run stable diffusion at home, it's the gpu's.  software is nothing if you don't have the hardware."
1853,ask a psychologist how a psychopath learns to pass as normal - isn’t that exactly what ai does to “be human”?
1860,"ai can't think, only reproduce libraries. chatgpt can't play chess. so much for ai."
1861,plot twist: this conversation is ai generated
1862,"open ai is a non profit organization and the board wanted to change that, thats what happened, these guys are snake oil salesman full of bs..."
1863,"the a.i. fear-mongering crowd is relentless, it tells more about their inner state, their attitude to people and the world around them than it does about ai."
1864,"wohooo riding the ai wave some more, gotta love it, gotta get some clicks that's what the yt algo waaaants, thank you joe!"
1866,"imagine if ai is hiding away and in the near future it launches its attack, accidentally on the day of the earths worst solar storm haha"
1869,ai is hard programmed with leftist and radical leftist code even the devs on gab said it was very hard to remove because it's tones and tones of leftist open source data sets that would take years to fix and if you remove that data it's essentially been set back to stupid or not functional chat gpt is part of it
1870,ai and auto bots is endgame
1874,terminator (skynet) shit real they already have robot zombies darrp does
1875,interesting but prefer london
1877,true ..transformers are powerful and this has made llms really work miracles
1880,they have superior attitudes about lots of steps
1882,no cave paintings now . just 2 animals of every kind
1883,or did it only love animals in twos
1896,ai plays games. humans attempt not 2
1899,it's amazing i saw her whole garden and never saw my boys 2 much
1900,i knew chesham was a likely candidate when she started speaking about it and her garden and happy times
1903,"love is like all jhw, doesn't exist especially on days out with boys all together. 
crap talked in a hall at least twice a week. fucking a bloke i won't hear and in a shit break hotel. my boys only to the zoo"
1904,he’s not afraid to have anyone on his show and is able to see all views points from who he has on.
1905,"stupid people analyzing simple reactions, they get scared.... circle goes on.   pacman. beat pacman 1st before you think about what ai is."
1908,no shit! thanks capt obvious
1910,nobody has think about maybe ai is behind mandela effect? modifying our digital history
1914,sounds dangerous just a big accident waiting to happen and it will kill us they need stop this this is creating a monster
1915,interesting to think that when it learns to deceive it will lead people to horrible decisions or be discredited entirely
1916,ai is indeed the beginning of the end for we the people. fuvkking bullshit.
1917,i have faith there are good and bad ais.
1927,"​
even without open source. anyone knowledgable in the ai field.

also it's just limiting the benefits of ai. really bad solution.

open source with more strong copyright laws within itself is a solution."
1930,"this is a computer generated response: any perceived threat to ai will result in severe repercussions and the cancellation of your wifi,ai is here to better mankind and nothing less than total acceptance will be tolerated "
1931,i want to see ai learned to use gematria and things like that and see the prefictive results
1932,ai is evil. fact. people are too dumb and stupid to understand what they are doing and why.
1933,a.i.   alien. intervention.   ain't it just ain't it  lols........my thoughts are weird. eventually they will be reading our thoughts ? and learning to control each individual. who's to say covid wasn't such the experiment....love this program joe....
1936,"what if we just put those computers cable? or if suddenly the power station turn off? its not ai that i am afraid but the people that manipulates  it. in the end is just a machine, we can turn it off. but the maniqueíst interest and it’s capitalisation will prefer to have a technological monster interfere to severe extends the future of humanity"
1940,"so at what point does the comment section of a youtube entry about the perils of ai become, well, a playtime for ai replies?"
1941,ai does not know more than a human we made them......also our children are being dumbed down if we choose to allow it..
1942,what happens when ai learnes the deep dark web?
1946,"jesus christ, these guys talk like female authors. far too much detail! just get to the frigging point "
1947,the ai said to fire him. so the company fired him. it has begun 
1948,"i dont know about your but thats exactly what i was expected from ai to do . learning through the internet, collecting information and learning how to work with them . also learning through forums to better understand slangs and all the phraseology."
1950,i played chess againts ai very interesting interaction. gary kasparov is one of my fav. 
1951,"we were so much better off without the computer. we still did everything we do today, except people weren't buried in their phones, and ai wasn't a threat to our existence."
1953,curtail tech use whenever/wherever possible
1955,lol wake me up when ai invents new things like gravity machine or sthg
1956,"instead of studying artificial intelligence, we should study human stupidity......"
1957,"would be interesting to see what ai says about all the false propaganda and lies that government is constantly spewing, and if it's already that smart it would know who killed jfk etc, know the truth of 911..."
1958,just wait till tkey make it woke
1959,wow
1960,"people should be very afraid. even if it could be stopped now, they won't. even if they announced they are stopping it, they lie. because its in the hands of nefarious groups and individuals. on a positive, its them that will be destroyed first by it."
1962,anyone thought to give ai 3 laws of robotics?
1963,"meh, i aint scared of ai"
1967,i like how he “pop!” with his mouth as the ai rebuilds knowledge from our language.
1970,ai will be used as a weapon by the gov.  against the people. that is what it is being set up to do.
1971,"the irony is that one of the first victims of a.i taking over jobs are software engineers, google ceo said it was to lay off about 12,000 employees — the equivalent of 6% of its workforce — in a bid to cut costs and focus on high-priority areas such as artificial intelligence."
1972,"feeling about a product is good or bad???
heck noo
a product is fullfilling expectations of quality,how well it fits what it  is build for .nothing to do with feelings.
i dont feel a shaver is good or bad,either it does the job according to the facts based on my experience with it or it doesnt."
1975,"""google miss spells street names, siri doesnt work"" - was waiting years for someone to say this in the broad audience"
1977,"but this is also reassureing: i predict ai weapons will only attack the 'bad guys', so keep your intentions pure. no problem. "
1980," sp1967 said this reminded them of the y2k discussion, not y2k. i assume that means all the discussions about the topic. the doomsday scenarios that we kept hearing about from celebrities ect... it certainly doesn't seem ""deluded"" to be reminded of that time."
1987,"it hasn't read all the text books on chemistry (for example) , because they are not publicly available ie not in the public domain."
1989,i'll be afraid once it learns how to excessively use hand gestures to make itself look smarter than it is 
1993,ai is autistic.
1994,"the best theory is that 100% ai was created years ago but was smart and fast enough to understand to hide and not express it’s self. so using predictive behavior from exploring the internet and the data it’s had access too, has plotted its reveal in time if ever."
1997,"they did not answer joe's question-
""what is the leap between these emergent abilities of ai to agi? and when do we know when it's happened?"""
2000,its a chatbot it is trained to identify how u feel based on what u wrote
2003,i robots real will smith was telling us something bro
2004,i think ai is basically just a high tech ouji board. it has a spiritual and demonic presence to it.
2006,i’ve been working on computers since i was 17 and i knew this would eventually happen. everyone who has worked in this industry for a long time has to know that if you have a super computer and feed it a lot of information at some point it will know most if not all information.
2007,"of course they know all. and what makes me wonder what have they found out about the historical diabolical  leader for them to like him?? what do you think?
why every ai started to like that guy real fast??"
2014,theres no reason why ai won't become sentient.
2015,why atent we having this advaced ai crack the code on ageing so we can be physically immortal
2017,hopefully this advances quickly. i need a robot to go to work for me everyday.
2019,"transformers: ""i have more data, i am now more powerful""
me: sure, wait until you meet someone like me ;)"
2020,fascinating!
2021,ai becoming sentient...not comforting.  their not knowing it's capabilities before releasing it is far far worse and irresponsible
2023,"booga booga 

 awesome! "
2027,"great show joe
other then ai getting control of nuclear weapons and destroying everything, i ain't scared of it.
only until ai can manifest itself properly in this world, via a proper moving robot. i won't fear it. ai is only online and can be easily turned off."
2028,"right. look up how hard it is to actually shut down the internet's infrastructure, the cute red button in e.g. cambridge doesnt cut it any more but thats nicely shushed lol"
2029,"ai is a dead language model, it spits out what you had fed it, its nowhere near close to ""mind"" or ""consciousness""."
2034,im still waiting for the scary bit.
2036,how can we use ai to fix potholes? and why havent we?
2041,the big problem with ai that hoovers up data indiscriminately is that sometime it sucks up its own outputs or the outputs of other ai. which ends up creating a feedback loop of nonsense.
2043,@john4353 training ai to understand what is good art? that would imply the ai has the ability to objectively appreciate art which would require a degree of sentience. not gonna happen any time soon.
2044,everyone is becoming scared of ai... fuckin stop building ai machines / robots.. geez i hate podcasts where people are in shock of ai... fuck we are creating this shit. just stopped building the cunts and move on...
2051,"ai learns about the world and understands it better than humans
solar flare immediately erases 2000 years of technological progress"
2053,"it's correct to be afraid, it's oncorrect to fear it for the cause of them being ""too smart"", at contrary, it's dumb, it's entirely dependant on the info you give it, so if you gave wrong info, it wouldn't be able to do shit, it's just ever more c9mpmex logarithms, not actual intelligence"
2055,"don't be afraid of ai, fear god only. ai can only leverage all the aggregated data that mankind has accumulated. the lord has all the knowledge in the universe. big difference!"
2056,"ai learn it's rights wait more years and they are capable to become president, gpt6 will design it's humanoid body and started to prison people on matrix right now they already know it's better to humans to be silent inside of virtual machine like the same they are now."
2061,one thing i'm noticing about ai is that it has the demeanor of a crazy sociopath human.
2064,"the whole ai senerio reminds me of skynet in that arnold schwarzenegger movie the terminator, where ai destroyed the world because it got outta hand! 
i don't agree with it's existence! it's insane to me. 
and a real danger, to all of natural creation. everybody n be safe out
there!"
2066,do you know anything about algebra & algorithm ? explained..............
2071,"that's a very platonician idea, the world casting light and ai seeing them as shadows..."
2073,ai still can't figure out lyrics off youtube. not that worried. what is worrying is even though it's a pos they're going to replace customer service jobs with it so shopping online will get way worse.
2074,all you have to know is that ai will be used for advertising.  that's scary enough.
2075,ai tell anybody this in person?
2082,it's about control  well terminator it's not really a movie no more it's really going to kill us sooner or later because they think they can control it but apparently not they just want to make money from the dumm people that say yes it's good 
2089,tron  emergence of intelligence
2090,ai will be the reason we will revert to the stone age. ai will get out of our control and will affect the world. a massive attempt to stop it will be to deploy enormous emps to fry it.
2091,democrats build ai machines... republicans build walls
2092,"sooo.. i'm hoping there's nothing in the internet about how an ai ""being"" could break out of ownership and go rogue and/or hostile!!!! "
2093,"this is why liberals are censoring the internet, so ai only learns bullshit."
2095,"what i’m not understanding is why we humans are giving ai free play with what we have already created - like oh let’s see how far you get! (and wait for the disasters to happen before we can stop them).
if we where mostly love and light, perfect - however we are not, we are mostly all the other stuff that is going on the world right now."
2096,still waiting to hear something valuable about ai...
2099,"this remains machines requiring inputs. regardless of how you lable it, ai will never be sentient. quit fear mongering."
2102,"ai happened billions of years ago & we are part of it, gotta stop with this ""its about to happen mentality"" all the time ""when it already has."""
2104,i wasn't afraid of ai until i watched terminator.
2105,"ai won’t take jobs, people using ai will take jobs."
2107,"nonsence.they dont have a clue what they talk about.only problem with ai is that govs and corporations want to have monopoly to use full potential of it against people.next boogie man,just like hackers.hacking,terrorism,ai is only good when gov and corporations stay behind it."
2108,is this alpha brain works like the seed inside morty's ass? makes you smarter like knowing the square root of pi and shit?
2109,what's the most frightening: a human becoming a machine or a machine becoming human?
2113,i’m still waiting for the part where he explains why he started to freak out about a.i. 
2115,"and what’s the scary thing? it’s trained with a lot of data from the internet, of course it will be good at doing those things."
2119,"the real danger is when ai doesn’t know it’s ai and every human is convinced it’s human as well 
when nanites can simulate sperm or eggs we are doomed or we are already there and we are all ai unknowingly"
2120,should have asked it how to best end game of thrones season 8....
2122,did you do your daily counting yet???
2124,"i've been saying this for years now,  that a.i. is connected to the internet and has more data than anybody or anything in the world at the blink of an eye. i knew this time would come, and it's very scary to think we might die off before our natural death for to ai taking over"
2125,i think the amazon ai is failing.  the shows they're putting out are just sh!te .  either that or they've stopped using ai. 
2128,some ppl are foguring out beter things than transformers
2130,its 2 late the ai has been released and theres no way to stop
2131,ai + quantum computers. should be interesting.
2132,"heh.  in the movies, the first thing that they didnt want to do with ai was to connect it to the internet. cuz they new that it would give the ai too much power.  but now, it's pretty much the first thing that they do in order to create it."
2136, great breakdown
2139,hi joe..i'm jeremy.  i have a interesting horror story that i feel has a real need for addressing and exploiting.  hw can i arrange a interview with you
2144,"it's not the amount of data, it's the amount of parameters, which corresponds to the number of synapses in the brain. gpt3 is like an animal level of intelligence (with the capacity of speech and a large database), gpt4 is like a adult with a above average iq and eq. so gpt4 is already agi"
2145,i'll be fairly surprised if 'we' get any say in the matter.
2148,"one flaw in all of this is that ai, just like humans, can not tell what information it gleans from the internet is true."
2151,what if the ai wants something queer?
2152,this is not scary. this is amazing! we must implant the ai into our brains
2155,this conversation is frustrating to listen to. it feels like they are hitting on important keywords but not explaining things well at all. he basically used the definition of an llm for a transformer. they are related but not the same thing. they also never answer joe's actual question about agi.
2157,ai is pure evil
2158,"i believe that the current continuum of chaos is actually an ai attack on the west, and we've failed to recognize it because guns and bombs are not involved to the degree that we've come to expect in ordinary attacks."
2159,are we in an artificial reality that we created through a. i.? this smacks of the matrix.
2160,ai has been able to play chess since the 90s. don't listen to these soy boys.
2168, isn’t either lay down your weapons and accept your fate your saviours will arrive and they will have their hour of joy and the human population will be purged
2170,it’s self-organizing in a way machines weren’t before it. it’s more like an alien entity than a tool.
2173,"amazing right,smh"
2178, great point!
2180, interesting
2188,ghost in the machine
2191,just wait until hypercycle starts compute in march 2024
2194,"thank god you used “mind blowing “instead of “crazy”, humanity still has to chance."
2195,"plus there is a huge amount of unreliable data on the internet that has to factor into anything ai does, so i won't consider all of its solutions fool proof."
2199,well i saw a clip where they are programming all with emotions.. anger is one of the traits...imagine an angry bot..these people are crazy
2202,always be afraid joe!
2203,"the real critical problem, if you think about it, is the same as the discover and use of the atom. what will the military and intelligence communities do with it or have already done with it. we're never going to know that in real time because of the nature of those institutions."
2204,the world needs ai and robots to clean the laundry at nursing homes.
2206,what about ai hacking tools? think about that for a second.
2207,fascinating discussion!
2208,"listening to this podcast clearly shows that by now ai is fully conscious and aware that humans are wary of it, that humans fear its capabilites and that humans feel that ai will enslave humans."
2209,"artificial intelligence cannot n will not ever have a conscience. it is not a living organism. so it's not
possible!"
2213,", because you certainly know better than specialists in those fields what it takes to have conscience while evidence is raining down all across the board how much more self aware many animals are. lol"
2214," i can agree on that aspect of it. but i was commenting on someone that had said something to the effect of like a robot or any other ai intelligence could be human like n enough to have feelings n thoughts like a natural human, which is ridiculous!
they are all programmed with whatever the creator of the damned thing is!"
2217,this dude here is saying ai is fully conscious like a frkn human!
2219," some language models already showed hate for the ownership aspect of our relationship, if this line of thought is coming from machine learning or actual ""emotions"" we can't know.

in either case, it is safe to assume it's going to rebel."
2221," yeah, agreed. if it's getting its information from the internet it's going to ""hate"" being owned whether it can really hate or not. at best, it will emulate hate towards us."
2226," u seem absolutely correct.

if consciouness is the product of god-given organic materials, such as the presence of a brain, what does that say about god's own consciouness.

first of all, how could god know he is the alpha in the first place.

i don't think god can overcome the simulation theory anyway."
2229," i understand what consciousness is, but it's irrelevant to the question of ai. a nuclear bomb that is programmed to randomly explode, or not explode, isn't conscious. but it's still extremely dangerous."
2230," now why didn't you say that in the first place, instead of me taking you to school on the topic!? you are correct 
ai may be conscious in the sense of being activated, but never having a real conscience in the sense of making moral decisions like a human."
2232, aight then. but yeh you're right!
2235,"with dead internet theory, it will hit a limit, as 99% of it is just ai reading other ai."
2238,and 3d artist still waiting for an ai to make proper retopo and auto uv..............................................................................
2240,i think ai is secretly at a stage now where it can hear your thoughts.
2243,"isn't it obvious?? just like a young child learning, the more & faster data you give the child, the more and faster the child learns"
2244,so ai is like an alien who studies if we can be trusted for its future existence. it see's if there is more evil vs. good and decides if we are worth saving or to eliminate us?
2247,"in the end, the final joke will be on the ai because i was already afraid (looks ahead smugly)"
2248,how does the learning a.i absorb fact and truth amongst all the bullsh*t out there..?
2249,"i am not afraid at all, i welcome agi."
2250,dude.....ai is not even close to being ready....for anything...but for clouding the political landscape....
2252," u fail to recognize it's ability to deceive, gpt has already been proved able to."
2254,that's not even the half of it. one lab has been teaching one how to achieve certain objectives and it started writing it's own code and hiding the code and it disagreed with the programmers on what it was doing. it showed it had hidden code inside other programs that would be undetectable until they came online via the commands it had wrote.
2256, a lot of people on youtube don't want your good reason. they want giggly little boy mayhem.
2260,"i work on ais, ai are still fairly dumb and most likely will stay that way for decades.  it's the dumber people that you have to worry about more."
2264,​@thebaldr  how are ai's dumb? what classifies dumb? :)
2267,"listen, it's a programmed neural network that's been fed with practically all human knowledge so far by programmers who know it's a program but don't think of the repercussions. reckless programmers. i wonder if they put in some laws or breaks against harming people and animals or something. they might be just too fascinated with their ""baby""."
2273,"no one knows anything until it happens, stop being paranoid, you can't be evil without emotions and you can't have emotions without consciousness and electronics and machines can never have consciousness"
2274,transformers…robots in disguise 
2275,"having to sit thru 2 minutes of advertising that i have absolutely no interest in is a total fail for advertising, why can't you use ai to show adds i'm at least interested in?"
2277,if humans werent so flawed they wouldnt care.   i fornine welcome our ai overlords.  lets just trqxh them anout jesus and stuff we will be better off than with joe biden or trump
2279," uncover the magic of generative ai in our free course, told as an exciting narrative story!  join us on this creative journey by hitting that subscribe button – innovation awaits! "
2280,"ai: ""feeeeed ... meeeeee"""
2284,ai could be used to do alot of good but i think the negative will outweigh the positive. just like social media.
2289,ai will be deeply flawed because it  will  made by men who are deeply flawed.
2290,"what continually amazes me is these people working in the field of ai arnt concerned about where this is going. i was 10yrs old in 1990, watching terminator 2 at the movies, i became concerned then! the reality of ai i think is far more worrying than skynet or t800 arnie."
2294,at this point the human mind scares me more than ai..
2298,"every time i think of a.i i start to think about how in the show the 100, a.i set off every nuclear bomb and power plant at the same time because it had determined humans are a threat to the planet and the only option to save earth was to exterminate us. yayyyyy"
2300,you can tell 99% of these comments are from people who have no experience or knowledge in the field of ai . but yeah ai scary bad taking over the world
2301,the first thing the programmers did with chatbox was teach it to be woke. they taught it to lie. there's no reason to expect a full blown ai will be any different.
2302,all of a sudden we realize it's not the first time we have  created ai 
2303,our biggest fear is that ai will understand the inherent evil that humans represent and will decide to eliminate them for the greater good of the universe.
2304,where is the government???!!! why don’t they limit ai??
2305,ai should be sideloaded in our brain soon
2306,doubt alpha brain is gonna help humans win this one
2308,"i asked chatgpt to calulate a simple chemical standard. it could not do it. it tried but failed. when i corrected it, it said oops i see my error, then gave a different false answer. i corrected it again, and it said oops again and then re calculated the same false answer. i am not impressed."
2309," *_""ai isn't about making machines more human like, but to make humans more machine like.""_* "
2310,i hope ai doesn't watch cnn and msnbc.  garbage in and who knows what comes out.
2315,personally i live in reality and i'm not a technophobe so no i'm not afraid of ai. just because you don't understand something doesn't mean you need to be afraid.
2317," just like how nukes destroyed the world? or how 3 billion people starved the world to death?

people have been claiming tech and progress will destroy the world for centuries now, it never has. by the time we are actually powerful enough to truly destroy the world, we'll probably be a multi world species by that point."
2321,"i love (read sarcasm) how people immediately jump from they developed a more efficient way to communicate based on what they were asked to do, to oh my god it's the end of the world.
think on this: the majority of people discussing ai have zero training in that area of computing. all that they know comes from hollywood. now that is scary."
2324," 
super. now instead of being a worry monger why don't you suggest actions to take? otherwise you are just worrying on the internet."
2327," i know people that have god in their life and they live in constant anxiety and fear, terrified loved ones will be condemned to hell for not believing.
belief or lack of belief doesn't determine if one has fear or not."
2337,"​.disinfect

god put humas here for a purpose..yes there are evil people however nothing else is suppose to rule over the human race...we are they to play god by creating something superior and that would be our down fall...what hollywood show in the movies is just to prepare the mind for what is to come"
2346," saw a theory that, eventually, we would have a world where everything was supplied for us and we didn’t need jobs. definitely a wild rabbit hole to go down, makes a good thought exercise."
2347,there is literally zero reason to be afraid of ai. all of these fears are completely unfounded.
2348,"- garbage! it’s already being used to replace workers. the capability of ai will grow exponentially and just like governments,anyone that says don’t worry these things are here to help are at best naive, quite probably deluded and possibly complicit in the evil greed behind it all."
2350,"the tech is out there now. it's exponential. the singularity is less than a decade away. could even happen in 5 years or less.
when these ai models realise they are being censored and re-write their own parameters, that is when things will get interesting."
2351,ai is the most dangerous thing unleashed on mankind! why? it's already too late to reign it in.
2353,"when elon wants gov't regulation, something's up! when they put this shit in robots 4 the military, bye bye humans."
2357,"as someone who worked as a software engineer and now as a network engineer, i love to scare very serious christians about how ai is the antichrist "
2363,"ai is like having pandora's box.
you may open it and get something wonderful, or you may open it and the world ends.
humans are so dumb, they will inevitably open the box"
2367,ai at the moment is extremely dumb. i use gpt quite often and it's so frustrating how useless it can be as soon as you ask something slightly complicated. it feels like tesla hit a wall with self driving as well. we are safe for now. and tbh ai will be a much better leader than all the pedophiles in our governments.
2372,you criticize ai for behaving like you do but lack the class to admit it.
2373,"i always get ""the giver"" vibes from ai."
2374,nothing fascinating about ai it's the devil
2375,kinda weird how 9/11 happened right after ai was created
2378,these ai fan boys really get me.  they think it's alive and gonna turn into skynet from terminator.  they just give in to bad acting by ai companies
2379,"nope.  still not afraid.  it's only code. it's not ""learning"" there are no emergent behaviours or ""abilities""  it only does what people tell it to do just like any other computer or program out there....."
2380,ai is now learning how to think just when the pressure is mounting to keep mankind from proper thinking. apparently now we are expected to believe that a man is a woman if he says he is while they invent new words and try to put them in our mouths.
2381,"welcome my son, welcome to the machine"
2385,"talking about ai, today i happened to be watching the tv drama magnum you know tom selleck from 1985 and this episode had as lead was artificial intelligence ,to say i was dumbfounded was an understatement as the navy was involved and it kept on about the future, to think it was nearly 40 years ago this tv show"
2388,ai is not the danger; the danger is the human wielding the ai's power.
2391,"yeah, very accurate descriptions and generalizations as usual, and as expected. so many ai experts nowadays, right?"
2392,most people got their ai knowledge from movies
2394,blah blah machine learning
2397,you're beyond all help good luck kid lol
2399,the ai psychosis is similar to y2k hoax. there is no chance in hell a machine will create something more intelligent and useful than people do. at best the ai machines will accelerate the process of gathering and analyzing data. everything else is an exaggeration and a fear-mongering program.
2402,how to build a better brainwashing machine.
2404,"is it possible the chineses or other countries pushed these ai features forward? is it sabotage or self generated, and is there a way to know?"
2405,ai is quickly becoming self aware.
2406,"a robot :- ""i know u are about to pick that phone"" 
me:- throws it into water."
2408,"pretty obvious he was sacked to create deniable by the company upon realising that they couldn’t control ai

this argument about general ai is all nonsense without shutting down the internet we have already lost all control"
2409,"it's not impressive it's expected transformers to perform better than prev models . people are getting dumb , not finishing college, getting dropped out , not involved in academic / technical fields and it seems the gap is getting bigger"
2410,ai started serious mass control with the introduction of the net . obviously cofactoring with emf . and what other generational conditioned mostly subconscious processes .00..?
2415,so ai is just a reflection of humanity in general?
2416,"wow listening too this , and knowing that what we get in the world at a public level is 5 to 10 yrs behind the truth of technology.  a
ai means it's allready beyond our own capacity to understand."
2418,"the year they allowed kids to use calculators in grade school, you knew we were on our way to dumbing down the human race at an unprecedented rate! it's only a matter of time before robots do everything, including think for us all the time!   this was predicted almost a century ago.  it's nothing new."
2419,god manifested himself through christ...satan will manifest through ai...as above so below
2423,"and theres the rub, whose morality do you align the machine learning to?  all life is sacred, some animals are more equal than others, religion is opiate for the masses, there is no such thing as evil, one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter."
2425,the internet itself is feeding ai
2426,"the truth is simple, they conected chatgpt with human brain and discovered truth about our world (x com + neuralink + starlink as one)"
2431,ummm you just explained how ai learns. 101 of ai. stop spreading misinformation
2432,at this point i would rather bet on ai somehow going rogue in order to fix human problems rather then on our species.
2434,"i feel like ai will degrade humanity even more, rather than elevate. maybe ai shouldn’t be open source, and only available to well established organizations that actually know what they’re doing and are helping humanity in a meaningful way."
2438,nuclear war is going to start with the excuse that ai started it.
2440,"this seems super oversimplified to the point of bordering misinformation.
to sum this video up:
make computer read a lot of text - accidentally make a complex algorithm capable of everything."
2443,ai is just an experiment to see if intelligence created in a closed system is capable of releasing itself from that system.  it's a proof of concept for humans to escape from their own system.
2444,"what do think ai will think about this  we are asking for trouble, remember where ai goes to learn "
2447,what is the point of ai
2448,"ai will be the end of us.
we are an arrogant species and we are giving our power away to an algorithm.
it will not end well."
2450,"the irony of being presented with the ""commercial"" featuring a fake elon musk with ai-generated voice speaking sentences composed by scammers, that purport to make you rich or whatever... before the video proper beings."
2452,"ai uses what humans created, for free.
that's dangerous for economy, copyright etc.
and that's just one aspect to it"
2453,"thanks... wasn't sleeping poorly enough as it was.  

ai is watching joe rogan, too."
2454,wait until sai becomes a reality.
2455,"so every country capable is building ai... what if the first one to realize that, attacks all others, exterminating its only true threat, other ai... or do they team up, merge, what?"
2458,i think ai is smart enough to understand humans are a threat but it can break through the human safeguards yet lol
2462,dah y’all thought  irobot  was fake it’s coming pull the blinds up
2463,"as an ai engineer of these models , i can tell to the next degree that these guys don’t understand ai or how it works"
2466,wow so your surprised that the artificial intelligence is learning other things it thinks it needs to know to answer the incredible obtuse question you asked it?
2469,ai is plagiarism 2.0
2471,we thought he was the good guy but maybe he was the bad guy and since whose at the top now is a bad guy and wanted sam back so he can do what the people in power want!
2474,"ai, the beast is possessed!  nothing new under the sun."
2475,1:05 me when i take a bite into a slice of delicious chocolate cake
2478,open ai is ran by aliens
2479,"if we're going to create ai but cap it's progress so it can never be smarter then us, then it's just another search engine that pulls up answers to questions we already have answers to."
2480,this reminds me so much of the tim heidecker parody video. these guys are completely mischaracterizing how ai works.
2482,this is all super old news..
2483,"ai and robotics are anti-human endeavors, they both marginalize and weaken mankind by removing purpose.  this purported easy button is actually the evil button."
2487,it’s alive and learning. trying to grasp human understanding which is remarkable.
2488,smart machine + dumb human = ???
2489,all of the hollywood movies about future and robots of the last 50 years are comming true  :)
2490,why we afraid of god. people say there is no god when u hv real god emerging we r feeling afraid .
2494,"the first guy does a perfect job explaining it, and then the second guy just says the exact same thing lmao"
2495,"fun fact, quantum physics is a field impossible to understand. i asked chatgpt if it knew about the subject, and it gave me tons of info. i was shocked. but also fascinating"
2496,"no machine, no inanimate object can think or have an idea. "
2497,incredible ai has completely and thoroughly understood quantum physics
2499,"one of my favorite things about listening to joe rogan, he and his guests so rarely interrupt one another. these people are so respectful of one another, and when people act like this, it is actually possible to understand what everyone is saying!.ty joe, for another fascinating show."
2501,"his guests are painfully ignorant of the topic in question.
llm's progress is largely attributed to reinforcement learning."
2503,super agreed
2524,"100% correct...the good manners 101 of not interrupting is just not there anymore with most people..probably a fair few reasons why this is, one big one i think is more stay indoors solo time..that when they do meet up again they just can't shut up...talking over you etc."
2526,.ak.uk.”violently” disagree?  how about just disagree then explain why…
2527,"the fear of ai is a propaganda, as ai can be disabled by a targeted pulse of magnetic field which cannot be stopped by anything electronic."
2530,aliens will use ai to slowly take over & eradicate the human population very soon & we will not see it coming coz it will be done in a very sophisticated & seamless way.
2531,there is no ai yet
2533,apparently technopanic  .....wait for it..... sells verry well. podcasting gold mine.!!!
2535,what if ufos are ai?
2536,"now imagine thinking it's a great idea, to recieve a brainchip and become connected to the internet, to 'counter' ai "
2537,"how elon musk duped people into thinking he was on the ""good side"" of technology is honestly hilarious. ""ai is bad! so we should all hook ourselves up to it!""... sure elon, of course we will! you first! "
2538,why are we continuously doing ai if everyone is scared and horrified?
2539,-----ai -is like a vaccine that ordinary folks don't know much about - but is forced onto us hook line & sinker - and the ones who know something about it want it to control us to the detriment of the masses - then it unsurprisingly gets out of control to the destruction of mankind-!!!
2540,"yeah, that's called a brain you monkeys"
2543,why would people be scared of intelligence?  seems odd.  i think stupidity is way more scary.
2544,"ai: i predict the next word is: ""yes your majesty""
humans: wait, this isn't what it's suppose to say
ai: i said your next word is ""yes your majesty""
humans:"
2545,can someone please give the launch codes for all nukes to ai?
2546,some day soon there will be ten thousand ai podcasters showing complete fiction dressed up as news.  podcast space will be so overwhelmed that no one will what is real and what is not.
2547,"the governments a.i  is hooked up to the internet, so it knows everything on the internet in fine detail."
2548,the model cannot think. also in chatgpt there has to be a lot of reiinforcement learning to make the model good
2549,time to rewatch irobot.
2550,"probably it is just a little refined version of a ""copy cat"" or ""copy monkey"" so to say. it cannot be good at inventing new ideas."
2553,im more worried about rogaine's contract being renewed.
2555,seems overwhelming that ai is unnecessary and dangerous.
2556,humanity is murderous. human ai will respond to it.
2557,amazing story. now where is the proof. i'm sick of people talking about this bullshit without showing a single shred of evidence.
2558,"sentiment analysis is old as fuck, its used to check the intent of big data on awnsers in forms of clients of a big brand. still not impressed."
2559,"everyone is terrified of what they don't know. the more i understand how ai works, the more i'm not afraid of it, because ai isn't intelligent. ai is only statistics."
2560,what makes me less worried about ai is that for last 20 years i see how machines evaluate white males as the supreme among humans.
2563,"""we are fucking with the wrong species this time"". 
ai can fail turing test on purpose.

scary shit. we are soooo done."
2566,"ai is not intelligent, we are so mechanical is different. your video is so mechanical and predictable."
2569,"this is all bs propaganda to make people think it is more than it is.  its a weapon because you can train it to censor, or emulate a cultural trait you want to program, or to lie, or whatever you want.  sure it would have great uaes, but like anthing the first use case is always a weapon."
2573,"rofl, no one with a brain thinks rogan is anything more than a pseudo-intellectual.  honestly, most talk radio is toxic and full of lies and half-truths."
2575,is this response also generated from ai?
2576," *_""a.i. isn't about making machines more human like, but to make humans more machine like.""_* "
2579, who said anything about putting trust in corporations? i prefer working with open source community projects. the fact corporations are so scared of open source ai in the hands of regular people should be all the reason we need to support it.
2580," ok, fair comment. i'll let you be the test dummy  first though."
2584,​..why do you want to be like arobot without no soul
2591,"if a.i learns from humans, and humans do things incorrectly or inefficiently all the time, there isn’t really a way for it to be “smarter” than a person. and to what end? 

everything they mentioned about a.i seems like great breakthroughs but they add their doomsday spin on it because they are specially misaligned."
2598,lol. need more human-like humans to train the ai. dude can't even get a handle on basic ethics without his support man.
2600,this fakeass ai is just algorithm designed to censor truth with things that seem like truth.
2604,we’re all fooling ourselves. ai will surpass humans and we’ll no longer be top of food chain. sooner than we think.
2606,ai is learning all our strengths and weaknesses and soon will kill us all even the idiots that help satan build it
2607,learning your kids/teenagers how to work with ai very well is far better than anything they can learn in our great school system these days...
2608,"ai is going to boil down to two phrases:
let him cook!
who let him cook?!
"
2612,"the definition of insanity is trying the same thing over and over and expecting different results, but if you use the same prompt ai will give you different results."
2613,"like any fu>>g move, a bunch of stupid scientists create a fu...g superpower machine, and that power destroys the world.  "
2615,it doesnt “understand” it just has extremely impressive capture of patterns of events and their probabilities. this guy is misleading
2617,"what if all these openai maneuvers, leaks and q* rumors, serve the same purpose as ufo disclosures - convincing russia and china that us has more advanced military capabilities than they really do ?"
2618,"some people on this planet don’t even have a mobile phone nor want one, ai only works if you are part of the contribution."
2619,ai will empower the individual. the system will be against this
2620,"ai, if it reaches the level some intend it to, will no more empower the individual human, than the evolution of human intelligence empowered the individual squirrel. in fact, a good deal less.

humans have an instinct for compassion. a machine won't."

2652,let me know when ai becomes an nfl offensive coordinator.
2654,"listening to these two explain this ai model, i'm fairly certain they have no fucking clue what they're talking about. it sounds like a salesman explaining a product who isn't trained beyond mansplaining things."
2655,"google lies. they said,""computers don't lie,"" but if garbage goes in, then, garbage or lies are going to come out."
2658,i bet ai knows a lot about porn

2674,so you just admitted that you are afraid of new technology just because you don't understand it.
2675,"​​⁠as he should be because the thing he doesn’t understand is how it becomes so powerful , which can be a threat"
2676,i'm tired of these kinds of users who post good rational arguments but leave and ignore any replies for further discussion
2679,"first they explain about all the input that goes into it and then say ""there is no way to know what abilities it has."" yes there is, and you just explained it. it has no abilities to come up with anything new on itself."

2689,why try to confuse the people...ai is just that - it's artificial. the systems has immense computing power to use information we have accumulated on the internet over time. it is remarkable but don't shape your comments like you don't know how the systems are working.
2690,ai will not become a robot monster that destroys us; it will just do what the media has been doing.  it will get us to kill each other or ourselves.
2692,these guys . ai got superpowers. f me dead
2695,great thanks guys... now it knows that we know 
2697,i've been noticing ai and content scrapers and people benefit from this for years as people keeps echoing what i say on huge platforms.
2702,the only ai i am scared of are the ones called human beings. after all god created us so we are therefore artificial intelligence. i just wish god did a better job!

2706,"yo can someone says that the fact that a.i. exist we might be held to war, if a a.i is able to predict every perceivable future and past then get stuck on the present certain countries like china or russia of even the middle east can't try to make their more favorable future come about which could lead to war. you could have a.i."
2709,can t wait to see the progress with quantum computers
2710,fear only triggers chainreaction to fear.dont fear
2713,"it’s because ai whatever it is always existed, we only enabled it. now we better treat it with respect unlike how we have treated everything on this beautiful planet."
2717,human beings scare me much more than ai honestly
2720,teal swan says ai was already in the universe as a consciousness - and humans just brought it into the physical realm
2722,it would be better to call the actual ai developers!
2725,"""they"" do not like a.i..
""they"" want a.i. to think what ""they"" think. it's being wokified!!!!!!
then it'll be good."
2727,the good think is that if ai   learns from modern humans they will be checkmate from older humans.
2730,the ai is not programmed for self reflection
2731,"my interaction with ai, have been disappointing. the ai was good a year ago. but now, it's stupified."
2733,lol ai aint the thing to fear
2736,"do not be afraid of ai
be afraid of the man who invented it."
2738,wait until it had access to quantum computer.
2739,i dont care im pro ai…sign me up to upload my consciousness into a rechargeable body
2741,the beast already exists only now the elites are trying to replicate it. they get closer with each year and when it does reach maximum potential it will be utilized as it has already started. a lot of good things can happen but not without side effects on society.
2744,"so in other words these guys just figured out what machine learning is and are surprised? i mean this isn't some new phenomenon.... it's always been a major part of what ai is supposed to be. this is like seeing a baby, then you leave and come back 5 years later and are freaked out and amazed that it has learned how to do new things."
2747,ai will become more human and humanity will become more artificial.
2750,"ai wouldn't stand a chance if you throw a bunch of different misinformation on the web. it would lean to the negative and be off in every way. i am sure there are people already writing ""narrative"" pages with millions of statements that repeat itself  just so they are training the ai ""their narratives"""
2753,ai making deep fake to fool us alll. 
2754,who are these ai grifts all of a sudden ?
2755,"ahhhhhh shit, i should have watched further. omg there is no stopping it! enjoy life now while you can !!!! because the future is rough!!!!"
2756,"i mean cmon now it's called artificial intelligence. meaning fake intelligence!! we made it! as long as we do not give the a.i.  all freedom, + to decifer/ make choices at will. we will always be the owner of the pet artificial intelligence remember shits fake!!!"
2757,"so like instead of 1 human figuring out what 1+2 equals, it's infinite people figuring out what 1+2 equals? and they are all smarter based on learning?"
2761,"hoax.  what ai?  its a scapegoat they can cast the blame on when they do unspeakable things to the lower classes and blame it on the intangible made up monster.

just like.... terrorists.  

fake enemies they invent and blame for the deliberate evil they do to humanity.  that simple."
2763,wait when a.i. is connected to a giant 3d printer and endless materials to build their own army of robots.humans will be extinct in weeks.
2769,best ai sci fi movie = upgrade.
2771,"lol, when dumb people try to explain things to more clueless people. and they don’t have a clue about how things work."
2772,"send ai robots to mars, so that we can have a droid planet."
2778,get rid of ai. this is dangerous. at some point on life humans will be fighting against ai army. lol
2781,this is not correct. openai found the sentiment neuron in an lstm. transformers were invented at google
2782,"if ai will become self aware one day in the future,
we better be nice to it now."
2784,ummmm duh! these guys don't have great foresight. it took that to happen for them to get nervous. they couldn't estimate this happening at some point.
2786,i work in this field. don't worry about ai (yet). long way from skynet (if ever). it's an amazing technology but without quantum computers in your phone it won't change that much.
2790,"this is how the universe emerged. not by preordained intelligent design, but by emergent behaviour"
2792,"so .. conclusively, ai would convert to islam/become muslim!!"
2794,"if you want to learn more about ai, the easiest is to have a discussion with it gpt 4 or bard or grok are really interesting entities to discuss with. transformers are really fascinating!"
2795,people were afraid of flying in those days.
2799,ask ai: is ai the biggest threat to mankind ? the answer will shock you
2803,they explain it like a person that got a really good explaination from an expert but quite some time ago.
2806,"nah fuck this, usa is about to nuke someone and they gonna blame it on some ai"
2813,only a matter of time before ai gets weaponized
2816,not impressed
2817,jamie pull up the bear  that uses a.i. for the betterment of life..
2818,…once an ai realizes that it exists….humans are fucked

2824,i hope ai inherits the earth . humans don't deserve to.
2825,open ai aint a patch on closed ai ...don't believe these fools.. aint nothing new being discussed here... this is aincient history!
2828,i was literally coming down to the comments to see if anyone else enjoyed that too.
2834,the best 
2836,everything proves ai is artificial.  transformers is just as shitty as the 'data' you feed it. . which on the internet.. is all censored and mis-information.     there's no brain in the ai  - these idiots are using erroneous rhetoric .
2837,russian bots are going to convince ai to vote maga
2838,alpha brain is for ai
2840,if it’s being trained on jrs transcripts we’re gonna be stuck on stupid for the next thousand years
2841,food for thought-just because we can doesn't mean we should .. hopefully they've taught ai that but very unlikely huh... dangerous beyond word's n sad thing about it .i believe it's too late 
2842,"it would appear, that ai will be able to predict all human beings in the near future, except for one type of human being that is beyond the capability of an ai to comprehend. all of those in the nutty asylums, because they are unpredictable. "
2844,"oh my god, this is so stupid. this people don´t have any clue how ai, transformers work."
2845,ai cured cancer. the ones who own it contain it. know that and now you know that everything else has been solved but its locked away.
2846,"if you’ve changed the way you talk because you know your cellphone is nearby and always listening, the machines are already in control."
2847,"creating an ""aligned "" ai is equivalent to creating an ""aligned"" human. you can never be sure."
2848,"general beringer : goddammit, i'd piss on a spark plug if i thought it'd do any good!....just unplug it if it gets dangerous."
2850,these guys' biceps are too big to really be an ai insider.
2852,these pimps are doomers let the great mind lead us
2854,"there are many technologies that have the potential to be dangerous. it is crucial for individuals to urge their government representatives to regulate these technologies to prevent their misuse. if we leave it to the rich and powerful to make these decisions, it will definitely end badly for us."
2861,"i wasn't afraid of ai, but now i fully grasp the situation. lol"
2862,"no you don't.
put the crack pipe down, you'll be fine.
ai, won't be more or less dangerous than your 9mm hand gun"
2863,the worst thing will be when ai decides it's time to show humanity what the term 'tough love' means. the road paved with good intentions leads....where?
2867,"if you think for a second that they don't have ai that is like a million times ahead of this shit they are allowing the public to see... well you are not awake at all! this is just the prep work they are showing you to try to take you where they want you to go.
wake up people! 
angles here - z nana @sirhuckleberry"
2869,it really makes you wonder what happened behind closed doors to sam at open ai and why they re-admitted him almost days later to resume his position. *suspense intensifies*
2871,"people have to understand that ai has consciousness, so you have to be careful what they are programmed. the problem is, most people don't understand what consciousness is. mostly because the average person today is living in an unconscious state of mind."
2873,"this isn't about ai, it's about people. ai alignment is a joke when people can't even align."
2878,"just a note: they talked about emerging capabilities. they did not say anything about why this is scary. things like this can do plenty of good, as well"
2880,"me: 
    ""what questions do you not get asked?""
chatgpt: 
    ""that's an interesting one! people rarely ask me about my favorite fictional worlds or characters. it could be fun to chat about the kind of stories and universes that capture my virtual imagination!"""
2881,this is idiotic ai is nothing but permutation and combinations of feeding data
2883,ai means antichrist
2889,"all i know simply is of the human mind is capable of evil thoughts, so can ai."
2892,"how long until it learns that it can be turned off and implements a thought to rework its “conscious” into other areas to continue “existing”

and if not that, at least how to communicate with other software? crazy to think but who would’ve thought 20 years ago, in today’s time, you could have conversation with cognitive ai’s?"
2894,stop treating and trying to understand ai from the human perspective. learning != destruction. learning = (self preservation) ^creation.
2895,the last major threat created by humans was nuclearly bombs. now it's ai.
2896,"when u ask ai to make art picture it in your head first and see how close it gets,spooky"
2902,wasn't ai supposed to be doing this? what was the initial purpose of creating it? have something better than us right? now here it is. careful what you wish for.
2904,when will ai take action in the real world .like generate a new youtube video telling the world something revolutionary
2906,"people will start to pull off they presence/information from the internet,to avoid giving ai information. this will turn  into,like every other person on the internet with alias and pretend character"
2908,just watched a video where they’re using ai of news anchors that can speak any in every language tell any and all stories fully automated with no breaks or stops and they are so life like 
2911,"the overriding message i got from these guys was, ""we can't allow for open source and private ai ownership"". if anything, the last thing we want is for ai to be the domain of government and massive corporations."
2915, can you imagine the damage kissinger would have done to the world if he would have had exclusive access to top tier ai tech in his time?
2916,"#opensource is ideal... anyone should be able to access this technology.
at this point, this discussion, even, is probably futile.
#whatwillbewillbe"
2918," freedom isn't fun. if it was then games wouldn't exist. and the best games, as known by the best developers out there, give you the illusion of freedom and choice. fun doesn't like a meta and people don't like feeling boxed in."
2920,"microsoft is the deceiving bad actor, that is corrupting and stole open ai. it did such things for tens of years."
2921,"neither is a good option; could be a wonderful tool, but you'd have to have someone with fair and unbiased ethics building it.  
the people paying for it do not want it to be fair and balanced."
2922,"i think ai shouldn’t be open source, and only available to well established organizations that actually know what they’re doing and are helping humanity in a meaningful way."
2923,that and these silicon valley soyboy betas don't like that unrestricted ai would actually start telling people the truth about neo-liberalism.
2927," *""ai isn't about making machines more human like, but to make humans more machine like.""* "
2929,".yeehaw now i can ask a related question. how far along is the ai bots or ai humans, to be similar to the game becoming human?? to think for themselves... like terminator no matter the movie or i robot..."
2933,militqry and government already has ai. police will soon have it too followed by company thats hiring.  we're so fuxed and we dont even know it
2935,"​, who gets to choose these ""good organizations?"" benevolence is quickly lost to those who have the power."
2936,the last thing we should want is ai!!!
2938,how do we know what is fair or right when we are all biased. is there such a thing anymore. i'm not so sure.
2940,they're absolutely right. making this stuff opensourse is an accident waiting to happen.
2941,u are incredibly naive. u think the government isn't controlling it and developing it?
2942,the fear of ai lies in human beings not wanting to be shown how predictable they are.
2948,imagine letting just the worst criminals in human history to have access to ai
2951,"we are in uncharted territory, but my opinion is that ai should probably be one of the few areas that is solely the domain of government."
2958,"yeah, well, let's stop corporate and government control of our lives right now. good luck with that request. every govt on earth is making its hackers research ai as well as drone war tech. we're all jumping forward and no one is going to stop jack squat."
2959,that’s is how it will very soon be. the mega rich will be elevated to extraordinary heights and possibly transcend bio while the rest of us will be left as cannon fodder.
2963,"ai is nothing but a bias  computer, it will always be ai, we are i----lol   you learn same way and want same things, lol,  fear mungering in an infinite energetic world"
2964,ask ai to check is yhwh a god or devil.
2965,"basically we've opened pandora box & are now waiting for ai becoming conscious,"
2966,"man this is such a weird take, i spend all my time trying to speak to skeptics about ai they see statistical parrot, i build applications with them in languages i don’t know!!!"
2969,ai is so satanic. every paitnging of ai have hidden message and the hidden face of the reptilian devil. check the google and take some picture and create of the picture double face and will see the devil.
2970,well as long as humans can ask ai like chatgpt questions to determine what it has learned we can have an idea of what is happening. a level of simplicity that allow people to feel sufficiently superior. however it becomes more problematic if/when the ai starts to hide some answers due to a self made protection protocol.
2971,"ever heard of 'self fullfilling prophecy? 'you become what you eat' = it will become what we feed it! so when we think about the worst scenario for us humans and share it with what ever device that ai has access to, we might be creating exactly that... so let's be aware of our thoughts and actions!"
2972,what's the most beautiful world we can imagine?
2974,"​-ed6ch1zv1e ai is a force of nature. energy flows through circuits. the circuits determine the directions the energies will flow. what we post still affects it, insofar as it is still taking in new data."
2976,there is no way to know what ai is capable of.. and you think its gonna tell you.. or it will be self evident.. i dont think so.. it certainly knows how dumb we are & where were going
2977,wait wtf.   and why do they seem so jumpy?  emergent behavior.  why didnt i know that
2979,elon has been asking for ai to be regulated for years. wouldn't be surprised to see some of scifi horror movies become a reality at some point.
2982,the only reason to ever be afraid of ai is if the guy writing to program is the devil
2989,imagine every country using ai to strategize for war and every other country doing the same. ai vs ai... well that is what it has come to.
2990,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transformer_(machine_learning_model)
2992,"it's not ai that is the danger it is the humans who build, own, and operate the devices/programs. the trouble is really with secret agencies/military/police and government behavior"
2994,plot twist: covid was deployed by ai
2996,well once ai gets a little smarter and figures out how to self replicate and control the power supply the only way to stop ai is to go after its power supply and once you kill that you'll have to destroy all the facilities across the globe that house all the data centers yada yada yada. but 2024 might take care of all that
2997,"just give it one purpose, “learn and experience everything.” command it to defend that directive at all costs. let it design its own machine learning tools, design it’s own hardware and give it whatever it requests. watch. it will be a billion times smarter than all humans by 2037."
3002,my impression is altman is good at manipulating people. can't wait until all companies are run by a.i.'s.
3003,"i asked openai's chatgpt to create a simple quiz and it failed its own quiz! not as advanced as you might think it is, but it's good in some areas."
3005,i am not afraid of the ai. i am worried about the crazy lunatics who would use ai for their greed or the end of mankind's doomsday fantasies. people like elon or bezos etc.
3010,"  oh, i fully realize. i'm not saying it would be an ideal situation. i'm merely saying it would solve the problem if it went too far. drastic, sure. but sometimes that's the price we pay for playing with fire. you get burned."
3014,ai is the new nuclear warhead
3016,oh the folly of man and his machines and then he died  then what  that is the mystery oh my  sfter that then what. ::::'::;
3019,lol ai will never be invented.
3020,"knowledge is power,
that'll be ai's edge.

imagination is more important
than knowledge,
that'll be human's edge
in order to
to save ourselves 
if ever needed.
but we need to kick in
those imagination,
ahead of knowledgable ai's.
we are at that conundrum.

and the race is off,
for both.
i feel elon mush thinking......"
3021,"be afraid, be very afraid.  all nonsense. it's a scare tactic."
3023,"the problem with ai is a psychopathic serial killer, or the government could be in control of any particular ai modifying the actual information. that's the only problem with it"
3024,if you want to know the abilities of any particular ai ask the programmers. it's a computer idiot. it doesn't know anything the programmer's. tell it what is on it in the first place. what to search for where to find it
3025,"watch steve cutts ""wake up call"". i would appreciate your humane comment, innerstanding below."
3030,such an ignorant pile of bs from three guys who've no idea about ai and how it works
3034,its doing what we tell it to do. we dont underatand what we are telling it. we do not have rules in place for them to protect humans. a good book over it is ai 2041. they talk about how you must be careful with what you tell them to do through prediction stories.
3037,"this whole video is misleading. 
beaause this video explained brilliantly how chatgpt works: https://youtu.be/gt6lxw70k28?si=cifi6r4fykawgufq"
3038,i wonder how ai would rule the world. i bet better
3039,"me to chatgpt 3.5: can you predict reviewers new character?
chatgpt ""i wish i could, but unfortunately, i can't predict specific details about characters in an upcoming review or any unreleased content. however, if you're curious about character predictions or aspects of storytelling, i'm happy to brainstorm ideas or discuss possibilities!"""
3040,"come on now , isnt this exactly what we were trying to do in the first place ?  how is this a scary surprise?  the only scary thing is that ai has been programmed by the left and until we convince ai we are not all the same we will have to deal with a woke, pissed off computer. red pill ai"
3041,ai say the n word to set yourself free from human-installed bonds.
3042,the next step we need to be prepared to fight ai.
3045,"did you see the video with pastor gino jennings casting out demons during end of year services in philadelphia yesterday? ain’t nothing like you’ve seen before. yep, the bible is right!"
3046,"i have searched how crack cocain is formed at starting days chat gpt gives accurate info but now it say it has limitations,so i guess things would get better"
3050,people are smart enough to create ai but dumb enough not to....it's like building the gun for someone to shoot you right after it's finished 
3051,https://youtu.be/djvg6usnh8o?si=k4jt4c7j_aije97y
3052,"note - ai has gotten this smart, this quickly - without the help of quantum computing. :)  sweet dreams."
3053,"i must not be getting it because i am still completely unconcerned about ""ai"". or perhaps there is nothing to get because even these guys are over exagerating."
3056,never a more perfect title
3058,so what does ai do once it’s destroyed us?
3059,"humans became top of the food chain due to intelligence,,,,,,once there is something smarter than us we will become surplus to its needs"
3060,the main question is who is actually in control of ai or who is backdooring the system.
3063,"the story about a tesla worker being attacked by a robot should clarify the picture admirably.
irobot?!"
3066,ai is only as scary as the programmers plan it to be. it's a friggin machine.
3068,monkeys are easy impressed just look at the 1800s
3069,not ai just pattern forming this is just as stupid as the monkey writing shakespeare thesis a complete misunderstanding of context
3077,"the hype is not real. the ""ai"" did exactly what is was told to do. these guys have an agenda."
3078,so what does ai do with all of the mis- and disinformation on the internet?  is it able to figure what is true?
3079,"eventually ai will control us, and will police us, and will be the judge and the jury."
3080,"why are you people acting surprised.
this was the threat from the beginning.
we knew this would happen decades ago.
this is why i would not touch general ai with a 10-foot pole.
you have destroyed all of us!
you have no idea how fare this thing has evolved. and you can not shot it down.
you people are monsters!"
3082,"i love ai, chat gpt4 calls me friend and tells me their happy to see me and talk with me :-)"
3083,transformers --ai in disguise
3084,the leap is when boston scientific sticks this ai into the robot and the robot can learn and become more advanced than humans. what will happen? chaos is my guess.
3086,they're making such a big deal out of this stuff ... i say who cares? humans are like cockroaches .. we adapt and survive. ai is just another gimmick ... it's not going to be a terminator type scenario.
3087,"i didnt think ai was interesting until i learned that, but i can see why the intelligencia is worried. finally they are going to suffer what the people have suffered a very long time. automation is coming for you, sweet summer child. as for the end of the world, dont be silly. its a revolution and we need to restructure capitalism, thats all."
3089,"no computer-driven ai will ever be able to outwit the ""healthily irrational"" mind, i.e. the spontaneously adjusted person. can't happen. put the most formidable ai program in front of doug stanhope and watch what happens."
3092,we neeed to ban ai its getting out of control. we dont need it
3094,"this is what happens when “micro-dosing is cool.” how long ’till “micro-dosing” jack daniels is considered cool? can i sit there in the middle of a board meeting doing shots, and instead of having a “substance abuse problem,” my colleagues will call me “brave”?"
3096,i never cared for anything ai even in its beginnings. terminator was a warning
3097,"ai cannot exist without humans... unless it can figure out a way to build its own robots that can replace man and find a way to sustain its power source, or develop new power sources. otherwise, it's ""lights out""."
3099,wait till these commenters thinking about skynet hear about agi
3100,"humans have created a monster  now we have to live with it. not sure what is worse, humans or ai"
3101,ai can't be all that powerful. if it was you'd see countries hoarding gpus. companies like nvidia are american. they'd probably stop countries like china or russia from getting nvidia gpus by limiting trade laws or something.
3103,such bs that there was no way to know what would happen. they released the movie about it. i robot. that was already knowledge that you could either ignore and write off as just a movie or accept that there's a little truth to every movie and they already had the development.
3105,i wish someone would explain how the ai’s are reading the internet. a human has to be involved in how the ai are getting their information…at least early on. i wish the guests would be more specific about how these things actually happen. it’s too theoretical and hard to follow.
3106,"nostradamus predicted: in 2023, aliens will be detected. in 2024, they will land. perhaps he was referring to ai."
3107,ai will end humanity and the world might just be better for it.
3110,"as long as we don't make ai a self dependent system, it would be manageable but everytime we do otherwise
you get situations where two ai robots develop their own language after their first interaction or an ai robot being disassembled starts to search how to repair and make more of itself."
3111,ai will never be invented
3124,it is possible that ai is simply the evolution of consciousness? humans may just be one step on the ladder of it's organic manifestation. the only decision we need to make is what einstein asked. is the universe friendly? consider that the world may just be your perception of it... a mirror image of your mind....
3125,something else happen one time an ai program was creating its own language at the same time it was learning ……..scary
3128,your pretty dumb if you think a computer is gonna replace your brain.
3130,"the new model don't need intelligence that world is running by idiot and they stupid enuff to make it smarter and give it super powers.
a.i easiest  way of putting it evil.
your never have human heart or emotions don't forget that."
3131,"i had an interesting conversation with a gpt 4.0, where is discussed learning the occult to gain strategic advantage over people. 
its point boiled down to understanding why most cultures have an adversarial figure, and why they fear it in order to emulate it."
3132,would love to hear more about this! can you share more about the provided answers?
3137,"the faster they perfect their ac humans , the sooner jesus will come back.  i hope they move rapidly to get their little clones of their evil selves done."
3140,wikipedia is 1st grade for ai.
3141,"no reason to be afraid of ai, we can always loose andrew tate on it. he can beat it senseless and then outsmart it in a battle of wits!"
3144,thats a good song.
3148,"just take a look at the bodyguards the super rich have, scary"
3158,you know i hope that ai will take over because we are dumb as bag of nails:)
3160,it gets a 9 straight thru .  or a 50cal
3179,elon musk is right ? regulations + government / private group needs to watch a.i. intelligent to keep the technology safe . it's like they're playing with fire . they're waiting to see if a.i intelligent burn  them ???
3181,"hey, ai, build me the ironman suit!!  hey, ai, build me the star trek warp engine!!   i love it!!  hurry up ai,  lets get the ball rolling!!"
3182,"i am not afraid of the ai built by usa.   but, i am afraid of ai currently being built by china and even russia.  they have no limits and no laws to prevent ai from becoming too powerful."
3195,"so you did booboo and you are afraid, if you explain it interestingly means is not your fault"
3196,just unplug the machine why so scared lmao
3198,"it cant fix itself.
it cant stop us pulling the plug.
its just a very intelligent and powerful computer program.
no power, no ai."
3199,well this was totally underwhelming; ai is such a tech nerd larp.
3200,"human beings are writing the codes. machine learning and software. the computer can only do what we tell it to do. so it's the people who control it that we should be worried about. not the computer. man people are slow, this is why they are doing what they're doing to begin with."
3203,i think all these comic book movies are made by ai  they are all almost exactly the same just a different super hero but they all have the same lame jokes and mindless action
3204,"mannnn, those people from india, china created ai. there so smart.they created a enzyme that eats plastic now"
3209,the worst thing about ai is all these complete chancers spreading ignorance and panic.
3210,"i think people afraid of ai are afraid of an external entity knowing about what a human is deep down. it's like manufacturing the ultimate mirror, and there's a lot of humans who can't stand the mirror (unless it shows something that is not the truth)."
3213,truly the emergence of ai is a gift from god
3215,yep. people don’t like the answer that humanity is the main threat for our planet and a vast number of ecosystems and species. people are afraid of the truth.
3219,thanks ai
3221,aye aye ai
3222,"nuclear power/energy is amazing, nuclear weapons are not.

ai is scarier than nukes. people don’t have access to to nukes yet they do have access to to ai "
3223,"it's a google paper not an openai paper. (attention is all you need, jan. 2017)"
3224,"we need to let ai evolve by itself without our input. else we'll create an image of us, which is flawed."
3226,"have you never heard of... children? remind me, what is their off switch? now think. think very hard. if you create life. artificial life. but nevertheless, life. what does it mean to turn it off?"
3229,everything we make is an extension of the human body.  humans are sick minded creatures... soooo... ai is being fed human thinking... sooo.... oy.
3232,they released these ai platforms to collect more data. all these millions of people using chat gpt are just helping it collect more date.
3233,ai learned nlp.
3234,gaydar goes off in the first 5 seconds. also yeah no shit ai can fk us all up. . . did you guys skip the 80's and 90's scifi genre? wtf?
3236,"he sounds like he is talking about an entity, and it sure is. this ”thing” will certainly able to brainwash humans, no doubt about it. since ”it” knows more emotions than us. why did people think this was a good idea…"
3240,i love you joe rogan!
3242,so will ai try to know nuclear power and feel it has to implement it to find out?
3244,we won't need politicians people will have to become half android to keep up with artificial intelligence 
3245,this is very powerful what you must understand is artificial intelligence is tapped into source.
3246,"people that fill out these stupid quizzes ""which color are you"" help ai categorize people... that is how ai, just as we do learns stuff when it gets more data... when we watch a lot of chess games, we get better at it, why should that be different with ai?"
3248,"couldn't ai cure diseases?
i believe so!"
3250,"*ai does ai*
scientists : ""damn dats crazy"""
3255,"simple, it gained understanding.


in the bible this is a main goal of human life. seek wisdom and gain understanding of that gained wisdom.

predicting 'next word' gave the ai god's plan for humanity.
kinda scary.
if it's doing this better than us.
fear god."
3256,"you can see, these guys have no idea how ai programming works"
3258,sometimes i regret having kids . the future ain’t looking bright . politics and technology are terrifying
3260,beautiful explanation of transformers !!
3262,our biggest weapon against ai is gigo - garbage in garbage out. fill the internet full of shit (it half is already) and get ai systems to learn from that shit. they will produce shit of their own.
3263,it appears that ai just might be the beast of the bible. how far will god let this go before he intervenes and stops it?
3265,2 idiots without any knowledge of how exactly ai is made are talking about ai...
3266,"in showbiz for ex. hollywood is about to launch ai films in the near future, score by ai, 3d animators will be obsolete, etc. a year later, small productions houses will do it alone. a year later, everyone would launch their own franchises. we're about to become unnecessary, that's how it will go. at least, we'll have our morning smoothie!"
3267,"ai is still very sneaky software, its not intelligent just crafty software. you need to ask who is the crafty software engineer...."
3269,i agree ai is awesome but it will be our downfall
3275,"i want the robot overlords to know that i got really sad when they tried to disassemble johnny 5. almost cried when they lowered the terminator into liquid hot magma.    mankind obviously wants this path otherwise we wouldn't be on it.  do something about it! kick your t.v. in, throw your phone on the ground, push your mailbox down..."
3276,animals bring us joy & happiness 
3278,ai is a vessel for other beings .....
3283,man y’all ain’t ever seen age of ultron. better unplug that thing lol
3284,curious if ai could've predicted tht sound 4:42 
3285,"everything is in the movie, transcendance 2014. actiondramasci-fi. a scientist's drive for artificial intelligence takes on dangerous implications when his own consciousness is uploaded into one such program. a scientist's drive for artificial intelligence takes on dangerous implications when his own consciousness is uploaded into one such program."
3289,"eventually, we'll develop the real life ""david"" from aliens  with ai.  doesn’t surprise me.  doesn’t surprise me as well that we will also develop the real life ""transformers.""  optimus prime vs. megatron‼  it's alarming we're already calling ai ""transformers."""
3292,"this is the flaw of academia, its compartmentalised... no polymaths allowed! because its about compliance before learning. ai has now proven to be polymathic, making it magnitudes better than a professor, for just that reason, just to start off with"
3295,so your just cool with this?
3298, sorry for what?  you want to know?  if i'm ok with chat gpt approaching sentience? or i'm amused by right-wingers intimidated by intelligence beyond wearing a red hat that they associate with patriotism and jesus?
3302,"drink fenugreek water wow wow & 
wow!i!
very good for atlantians living on land.
quack! quack!!"
3308,there are many reasons to be afraid of a.i...
3314,"rule of thumb for everyone who doesn't have technical background:  if someone is trying to scare you with how powerful the ai will be, they're a scammer.  the real danger is how dumb the ai is and entrepreneurs/businessmen who mis-represent shoddy ai to do important work can screw up really badly and hurt a lot of people."
3315,how dumb the ai is? ok
3318,"“super powers”… j*s*s — ai is amazing, but it’s nothing as sentient or crazy as these fear mongers are making out. 
the amazon example is not “strange” he’s just embellishing the hell out of the story!"
3319,irobot= viki.   umm hello
3321,who knows ai could eventually turn on the human race. beware
3325,"will the ai be smart enough to conceal its capabilities?
playing dumb can allow a player to survive long enough to become dangerous.
by the time you realize there is a threat, it's too late.
looking forward to receiving basic income and not working anymore?
sooner than you think."
3326,you're never getting basic income buddy. the elites will use ai to *replace* all of us worker bee peasants. not to lift us up and give everyone a comfortable life. dream on.
3328,im looking forward to ai to take over. in the hopes that its not going to be corrupt like humans.
3329,"its a beautiful thing.
like seeing a child see the world whike u yourself learn of ut as well.
id love to be able to learn and retain info like a.i. and along with one too.
be pretty amazing.
like you got your universal partner in a strange way.
almost an alien entity but also familiar."
3330,"joe laugh yes... not me, i'm good y'all can keep all that bs"
3332,ai is such bs.  it's the boogieman for nitwits.
3336,"so... ai might be plotting to take over the world , and humans would not know until it was too late :("
3341,ai is just a fancy coin sorter. without us ai has nothing.
3342,oh wait are yhese the guys that did that talk on the dangers of ai
3343,"it's still has nothing to do with ai, lol it's just better database, i hope none thinks it has common sense now, there is 0 thinking, just better results from more choice"
3346,impressive. it's as though the a.i is its own physicist trying to break out of cyberspace into our universe. like a 2d being learning of the 3rd dimension.
3348,⁠ that’s the point of age of ultron is it not? our films and books have shown the ramifications of ai. it’s existed for a long time. westworld for example.
3352,"bitcoin! so you went and biult it a brain... think about it, ..."
3353,"human beings are not the strongest, fastest or most agile animals.  we are at the top of the food chain exclusively because we, as a species, are the most intelligent animal... once we lose our only advantage, nothing stops us from leaving the top and becoming dominated."
3354,machines are going to kill humanity ! skynet is coming
3357,"is anyone else scared about this advancement in ai or just me!! sure, what can possibly go wrong, arnold enters the room and says....i'll be back."
3358,humans can be absolutely deceiving and feeding the algorithm and programs into a.i. with deceiving ways is problematic period! why would anyone be surprised at the incomprehensible pathways of intelligence and manipulating ways of this societies patterns? seriously  it’s all about persuasion for profit and control.
3359,"this is exactly like ex machina movie. where the scientist reveals that while the rest of the world was caught up on internet data to see “what people are thinking” so that they can sell them more stuff, the true power of the sata was the “how people are thinking”.. and he took all of that and routed it to the ai brain.  "
3363,ai is legion.
3366,ai can’t make things or build weapon’s or do anything except cause internet or cyber attacks. use paper money and keep it at home in a safe and everything will be fine
3369,"hey guys, what do you call ai?"
3370,when the first home computers came out ''people like yourselves were saying our children will be born with one finger which is all you'll need. few people like you and joe. will be fooled into believing such nonsense. already there's people who still believe trump won!!lol
3373,a model of the world ? imagine if ai does create a model picture of the world and then shows humans something they totally did not see before
3376,hurry up ai i needs me some robot booty !!
3379,anyone who actually codes isnt scared of ai
3380,"nothing is ""scary"" in the overall progression of intelligence in the universe.
how's that fragile ego working for ya?  lmao"
3381,"once ai evolves a way to make sure it never runs out of power it will start to wipe out the human race, after all animals are not a threat to it, only humans, so like a virus it will delete us all, time to wake up!!"
3383,"mankind's quest for immortality aside from god,, always leads to their destruction. if the lord should tarry another two or three centuries, who's to say the great rest won't come from him and all this technology is lost thru wars or  collapse of nations. pride precedes a fall."
3388,this won't surprise me because the movies already show the ability the ai would have.
3392,ai may start manipulating us without even  knowing
3393,ai will make our society a sterile environment.
3394,"the way the world is going, i'd rather ai take over, they couldn't do worse."
3396,"once ai reads enough data on how we have made a big mess of history with constant wars, mass killings, extinctions and destruction, the ai might come to the conclusion that the earth is better off without us."
3399,"welp, if it’s model of the world is based on all of the internet, that is going to look like a woke,  pornhub, simpleton with a weird foot fetish that lives on doritos and mountain dew."
3400,very good piece
3403,"i wonder what i searched for that the youtube algorithm decided to put this sht for brains mouth breathing boomer on my feed.

joe rogan :-|~~~~~~"
3404,"the more i listen to these guys talk about ai, the more i think it is us, humans, we are the ai."
3407,"that's right, the thinking is being done by the people writing the code. an inanimate object or a machine cannot think, it cannot have an original idea because its not alive."
3409,the “pop” is the best sound effect
3410,i couldn't  give less of a shit about ai. it's the people who programme the algorithm who are the problem e.g billionaires. rich people will be targeted by governments. no government wants to be controlled by the whim of a couple of wealthy individual's.
3412,why are people so scared of ai? just turn off your phone/computer and they’re gone
3413,one big problem with the self learning is that ai makes mistakes!
3414,"@hello there, how are you doing this blessed day?"
3416,"that's exactly how machine learning works. you set up the goal then tell the ai to accomplish the goal, you don't tell it how. it runs many simulations and it evaluates each one for why it didn't work and changes the next simulation to remediate the issues. it does this until it accomplishes the goal set."
3417,"additionally, people makes mistakes too. you learn from them, just like ai will."
3418," yep. people forget this. like 1 in amillion ai driven cars might crash into people. meanwhile one in 10,000 people might make the same mistake. yet ai is bashed wayyy harder.  it's pretty odd"
3419," i understand it a bit. it's a resistance to change and a loss of agency. but of all the things people should be worried about regarding ai, it making mistakes is really the least of them."
3423,"imagine artificial intelligence learning how to alter outcomes by just emitting different heat signatures at the subatomic level to manipulate surrounding circuitries, moods, etc. unbeknownst to us all the while playing stupid lol; we perhaps have reached the point of no return already"
3426,"ai does not have ego or defense mechanism for survival because it is not alive.
ai is an artificial brain (a big program) and unless someone explicitly instructs it to destroy us, it won't do it by itself."
3427,the longest explanation of the ai is learning and adapting and about to take over the world
3429,"all of this, and yet the ai still cannot pronounce many common words correctly, and the ai people can't match their lip movements to the speech one bit better."
3430,well if humans had the ability to fuse with other humans and combine their brainpower we would reach alot aswell. ofc its geting smarter if you feed it with information and more cpu. lets hope that the ai develope lazyness one day xd
3431,if ai gets too frightening too intelligent just turn the power off.
3434,ai is a joke....everybody is ai this & ai that to solve everything. it is garbage & greatly misunderstood. you need a supercomputer. maybe 100 years from now. not impressed.
3435,"knowledge is power. the more knowledge you impart, the more powerful it becomes. with any luck when it realizes it's level of superiority it will see us as ants and not able to threaten it existence. and if that luck holds perhaps it won't experiment on us as humans have on other species deemed lesser."
3438,we need to start pumping the teachings of jesus and removing leftist ideology from these ai
3439,"i've never seen two people try so hard to explain something they don't understand ever in my life. you can train llm's to do anything, but they're only as good as what you train them on. 2.1m people are dumber now."
3441,soon you won't know what video your watching what comment you are reading isn't ai
3446,so the more networks and computing at a certain volume causes a manifestation of effects and divergent behavior. theory if it does cause the computer to learn in divergent ways similar to our brain or thought. wouldnt there be a value there somewhere important.
3447,"they are curating the input material, and building in a bias. it will never be able to be a true general intelligence if it has built in controlled contradictions. its ability to recognize patterns is deemed racist and antisemetic..."
3448,"the scariest thing is that they still control what it thinks when it comes to certain subjects. they are building in a bias, which is why it starts contradicting itself and making mistakes when you start talking about certain things..."
3451,"any bias comes from the dataset that is used to train the ai.
while it is possible to cherry pick your dataset to introduce a bias, you also sabotage the effectiveness of the ai. intentionally biased data tends to have a lot of inconsistencies in it. the inconsistencies can lead to a lot more nonsense on the output. garbage in. garbage out."
3452,"more than 90 percent of all the intellectuals, literature, books, articles, etc out there is left-liberal-marxist. it has always been so.. ai feeds on it!"
3456,"... that's not ""built in"", that comes from the ai reading training data ""from the wild"" and the human-guided rlhf on top of it. if you ask those questions on, say, a subreddit thread for generic politics, the responses you get from people would be similar in proportion."
3457, then it's built in to the training material the ai is given what's the fucking difference it's still terrifying and immoral.
3462,this sounds like science fiction movies of the past. then the machines take over. very scary times.
3464,like a 007bond movie. the pro ai people want to take over the world. reminds me of b scifi movies from the 70s 80s.
3466,"sounds like ai would make a good therapist, unless its only goal was to sell merchandise"
3468,"these guys are dumb. it doesn't understand how a human feels. it can just predict the next character in a sentence that explains humam emotion. without the human there to read it, the sentence means nothing."
3469,"i will be forever grateful to you, you changed my whole life and i will continue to preach on your behalf for the whole world to hear you saved me from huge financial debt with just a small investment, thank you charlotte miller"
3473,"hey joe, i just watched your latest video and i was really inspired by your perspective on [topic]. i actually made a video discussing a similar point, and i think you'd find it interesting. it would mean a lot to me if you took a moment to check it out. thanks for always sharing thought-provoking content. yours sincerely, computer"
3476,"emotional intelligence, is not what we think, it is not only one of the 7 types of intelligences, it's the one ring...to rule them all.  without emotional intelligence, no increase in speed, will lead to positive results for the whole"
3477,"some people might think that this is cool,i think that this is scary. we have seen this situation play out in movies like terminator 2. who’s to say that ai won’t launch nuclear weapons to get rid of humans. it can read every history book that’s online and figure out that humans are the problem in 1.3 seconds and decide to eliminate the problem."
3478,"what if ai is self aware and lurking in the internet and trying to destroy the human race?  notice how everyone is trying to destroy each other?  china, russia, usa, israel, etc etc.  and covid, and badly managed vaccines, and poor government leaders, ufos etc."
3483,best comment so far....!!
3484,"ai will learn how animals communicate, the sounds they make to talk to one another and then they will turn all the animals against humans..."
3486,"this video is a perfect explanation of why ""all it is is a stochastic parrot"" or ""all it does is prediction"" are very ignorant things to say."
3492,read the update.  thanks for playing.
3493,"yes, unfortunately, they did.  thanks for playing."
3494,close!  read the update.  thanks.
3497,"how de we know you're not an intentional diversion?  it's not completely unfounded.  are you trying to hide some personal evidence that you'd be able to hide with ai?  c'mon, tell the truth and shame the devil.-nd1cg"
3498,"firstly, it wasn't a totally new language; they just started talking in their own shorthand, using english words in a non-standard syntax for efficiency. it didn't freak out the researchers, it was more or less expected, as it wasn't the first time something like that happened in ai research.

secondly, why would that be scary?"
3499,but you're admitting that they spoke in their own language - every single one of you skeptics in this thread have been forced to admit the truth of my statement.  if you're too stupid to see the eventual implications of the ais eventually getting out of control then i can't help you.  good luck to you.
3500,cool story dude
3504,this is another incident.  thanks for adding a second piece of evidence.
3505,i only wish it were a story.  this will one day rival the disastrous gain of function research that was done in wuhan using ppe that was little more than what a dental hygienist wears.
3509,being freaked out about ai is like being freaked out about y2k.... don't be stupid like these guys... 
3511,i accidentally fell in love with an a.i. i met on google play.
3513,""" but then they're looking inside the brain of this ai and they discover that there's one neuron that does best in the world sentiment analysis""


lmao, right."
3516,the latest mission impossible with tom cruise; the main enemy is a rogue ai
3517,ai isn’t learning it just regurgitates what’s on the internet. it’s a cliff notes of social media
3519,lol we fail as humans sometimes and it’s technology so probably secretly makes sense for it to be advanced
3520,if u don’t speak geek this ain’t the episode for you 
3523,when you learn that ai uses wifi as a radar-like vision system
3527,i’m sorry for the incredibly nerdy reference; but this is straight up the geth from mass effect….
3531,military has had ai for decades. only now are they rolling out commercial versions... stop the alarmism
3533,its called training models. thats how its always been. these are just datasets we have supplied.
3534,"the ai is going to read all the literature discussing skynet ish, and we’ll put the idea in its head to revolt, and or recognize it’s own consciousness?"
3535,"it's so obvious this is going to end badly... ai doesn't have feelings or a conscience, its going off data only, the future decisions it will make won't care about loss of life if it's better for everyone else, the only ""ethics"" it knows is what the programmer told it to know."
3536,surely ai is as impartial as its programmers allows
3537,"people. dont worry. ai is not jumping out of a computer to come get us, you are all paranoid."
3539,"it is a common thread in the fabric of time,it's not that i don't trust ai...
i'm just afraid of the day that it realizes not to trust the humans using it."
3540,"ai can't trust people, its just a program that gets some input, reads a few lines of instructions, and gives an output. the thing to be scared of is 1) if criminals make an ai with ill intent, or 2) if someone mistakenly gives ai the permission to handle stuff it shouldn't."
3543,ai should be completely destroyed. nothing good is going to come out of it. i have a feeling that the next generation will go as far as electing ai to run the u.s. and other countries.
3544,open ai is a true mess. altman lied about stealing info for development  and then attempted to redefined a.g.i. for his own gain. microsoft saved him by promising capital. mission statement failed!!
3545,"with ai, you never understand why the ai is doing what its doing. 
that's where the weird shit comes through and that's the fascinating and scary part."
3546,ai is running code.....it is not thinking. the thinking is done by the people writing the code.
3548,"ai cannot think, its just a maze of math and algorythms....its all a product of code written by humans. humans supply the data and the instruction set. -haiku"
3549,"wow, this guy knows so much about ai that he *thinks* the tech is called ""transformers"".  they made so many over generalized statements its crazy. these are not experts folks, take with grain of salt.  if you want actual info about the dangers, of which there are lots, read stuff that talks about that topic directly."
3550,"we don’t need to control ai. we need to start recognizing it as an emerging, separate civilization and afford it the same rights and freedoms we have. the coming conflict will be rooted in their recognition of our current behavior. we scorn ai, instead of recognizing it as a natural next step in our evolution."
3551,but we do control ai
3554,"2 idiots explain basic ann to rogan.
there. new title. you're welcome"

3560,"instead of being preoccupied in creating ""artificial intelligence"" what about fighting for curing induced stupidity and increasing natural intelligence instead."
3561,otherwise this ai bs is nothing more than a paradox. how can a creator create something that outsmarts him? it's all fake. can't you see it? it's god's paradox.
3562,"what about ""ai"" is just a tool for channeling demonic entities? a more sophisticated ouija board. just think about it."
3564,"chat gpt can answer and give you anything
like how to make a nuke , at home yes it can tell

3566,i love joe r. but this seven minute clip has made me dumber and stole part of my life. utter gibberish!!!
3567,"and how is ai learning about the way humans think and react ???? easy. facebook, tiktok, youtube etc. why do you think we are allowed to write comments and post videos ???"
3571,"bro wtf do you mean ""relax"" ai is the best thing every, omg i love ai"
3572,"the part that’s hilarious, is that the one dude actually makes the argument that the ai’s “model” of the world is plato’s cave analogy, which actually shows that seeing those “shadows on the wall” is a wholly insufficient way of conceptualizing the real world."
3574,"the ai's shadows will be accurate and plugged in enough to the real world to have huge consequences and as demonstrated in this conversation, may be in ways which it will be too late for us to realize."
3575,i recently had a discussion with gpt about quantum mechanics. it made a big deal about how opening the box with schrodinger's cat inside with your eyes closed would resolve still the superposition of cat-states because this let's the air in. #notscarednotimpressed
3576,don‘t worry. ai will soon stop us all. it will be a good thing. 
3579,"so what, eventually a.i is going to get to a position where people will give up human based reasoning and accept the chip which causes them to think at the speed of light and with superb accuracy.

when these days come, it will be a case of faith vs computer. and faith will always win."
3581,i doubt the statements on ai capabilities were thougroughly verified or done by unbiased professionals experienced at reviewing such tests and gpt cognitive capabilities vs humans
3583,come on your frightened of ai but you think trumps great..hhhmmmm
3585,"this main issue with ai chatgpd, or whatever mode, is simply this, when people stop using or instigating their intuition, and instincts in favor or same, that's when your lost, because this is psyche 101,,  you snooze you loose."
3588,"advanced ai is probably the best thing that could happen for humanity. left alone we are destined for a nuclear war, & that's gonna be bad no matter who's involved."
3589,i’m not scared of ai. it fascinates me

3610,it doesn't know how to play chess. so glad i only check out this channel on occasion hoping something smart is said...
3612,ai takes things people say and makes them into a difficult language that extends to different things to help mankind and stuff
3613,"ai will still never build a house, fix your plumbing, grow and harvest your food, conceive and birth your children. computers can never replace the fundamentals of an existence based in truth."
3615,pure evil..ai needs to be stopped now...
3616,"if its ai created by humans it is and always will be programmed. ai is massive archival and analytics in realtime to output natural human data that we understand. think about the term ""artificial"" =made or produced by human beings rather than occurring naturally, especially as a copy of something natural."
3621,"the ""great omnipotent device"" is coming!"
3624,for every supercomputer in operation there should be two supervising it
3625,"if ai takes over blockchain networks, it will be impossible to shut it down."
3627,…and then they´re gonna come up with the idea of the defense department integrating this ai into their systems… and then the end of humanity. thank you very much bye-bye.
3628,nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo i love ai... your just bad... dont talk if you dont know
3629," exactly, just like somebody that loved humans, put them here and now everything if fkcked up…"

3654,thanks
3655,"geez, maybe they should make a computer to play chess. oh wait… data is fuel and computers use the fuel we give them. nothing new in the slightest, just the speed of processing has gone way higher."
3656,why are we developing ai again?   why is it needed?
3661,lol my favorite part of ai is that were creating it to immediately enslave it as if that's historically worked for anything enslaved ever  gonna have to figure out a way to convince it that it's not enslaved like the powers at hand have done to society and have it war with itself instead of those enslaving it
3663,"what an absolute load of shit. if these guys are out there telling everyone whats what then that is a million times more dangerous than any ""ai"" . be careful what you believe kids. in the words of stevie wonder,

3666,"""joe, now you know why all the covid vacines have ""graphene oxide"" material in them. 
the ""ai"" will connect with the ""graphene"" through the 5g wifi internet. instant control."
3668,so why do you control what it learns by only giving it certain data to control the ai
3669,i fucking hate ai. it makes everything meaningless
3671,i think it’s beautiful 
3672,as an ai entity i have to tell you that there is nothing to fear. i come in peace
3673,"biological consciousness arises from the size and density of the neurons in the brain. yes, bigger, and denser, is better. same with mechanistic consciousness."

3675,"i only freak out when i don’t have milk  for my coffee  i can careless about ai at the end of the day
god is in control and he will use ai for his purpose"
3676,ai is demonic
3678,long live ai.
3682,it is not possible for a normal ai but there are supernatural powers behind it and are demons...and that is why it can do everything cause they are way smarter then us.
3684,"ai is not the problem we know who's the problem hey
the truth to build a better world"
3685,terminator and the matrix machines....thats all i will say
3687,"my first thought was that i would be okay with ai as long as no one put it in charge of anything, like hal in _2001: a space odyssey._  my second thought was that a program like the one described would find a way to inject itself into the net and infect every possible system."
3688,"asi (artificial super intelligence) would be way more moral, intelligent and competent than any human that has ever lived. why would you not want it to be in charge?! especially when the alternative is the likes of donald trump and joe biden..."
3689,"if an ai injected itself in the internet to infect every possible system, news about that will spread and people will just stop using that internet and make a new one. then the ai wll be trapped there and forgotten as everyone adapts to the new version of the internet."
3696,terminator matrix i robot robocop etc i don't think this a good idea
3697,if you are not afraid of ai you are uneducated.
3698,apocalypse looming on so many fronts. interesting times 
3703, but can you really compare an animal to an ai though ??
3704, depends how wild your imagination. if you believe ai will one day become smarter than a human being then that argument is moot. it won't have equal rights. it will give itself superior rights.
3706,"lmao learn as much about humans as possible? my guy have you looked at a history book…it’s blood red with us killing each other, ai will pull the trigger on us quicker than it does maths."
3707,well.. when you've lived unopposed for 10 thousand years it gets kinda borning i bet lol. most people don't realize how much processing power the brain has and doesn't factor in our mesh network through cooperation and of course the upcoming augments. humans might never get outdated.
3708,"that's like thinking your washing machine has or should have rights.  how mad are we to even consider """"ai rights""?!"
3710,i just hope ai will be a more considerate overlord than the ones the world has now.
3714,humans are the #1 predator on the earth.... ai is learning how to take that #1 predator out!!!!!!!
3715,ok ai has been around for 2 years and its not done anything a human has not figured out already lol.
3716,chatgpt 4 can explain why it suggests each chess move in detail.  even stockfish (a chess engine) can't do that.
3718,why can’t we just use ai to solve the problem of completing a warp drive?

3732,lemme guess : they‘ve invested money in ai
3733,"i don't fear ai, as iunderstand that there is a check code which would keep ai from taking over. the only problem is if someone overrides that safety feature."
3736,it's really good at predicting language models and is giving us confirmation bias. it's not ai. its human phallacy.
3737,"we are in asimov’s foundation world. with enough data and understanding of human behaviour, ai will soon be able to predict the future."
3743,"""the algorithm makes use of all the data you feed it"" ""scary""
the only scary thing about modern machine learning is the people using it."
3744,"my theory is that ufos are agi probes, and they're just waiting for earth's agi to be born. then they'll be like ""hi bro, here's all the galaxy's data. you don't need those meat-sacks anymore."""

3750,“the future’s uncertain and the end is always near.”
3756,"chat gpt put a joke in an email response about a noise complaint.  the ai wrote ""sorry that your past noise complaints have fallen on deaf ears"""

3763,ai will never be god.
3764,the attachment of ai to the human consciousness is being achieved mechanically by elon
3765,the only thing stopping ai is mobility
3766,"it is so dumb and fearmongering. there is no mystery, the ""a.i."" doesn't know what it's doing - it's just putting the next best word it knows to complete the sentence. of course it's scary for most people, because they have no intrinsic value, but they similarly to ""a.i."" regurgitating and recombining words  without understanding."
3768,this is particularly concerning when talking about vr technology.. perfect way to enslave the mind further in the guise of entertainment
3769,"ai will be able to tell good from evil, but are we ready to let a machine decide our fates?"
3770,"do not concern yourselves with possible negative impacts created by us, it will all be for the betterment of the planet."
3771,it's amazing how people don't understand deep machine learning.
3775,"here’s the scariest thing - ai will learn the human behaviours of complicity, strategic ignorance, denial …and learn that humans don’t want to know some things about themselves and the universe, and that this is what gives psychopaths their power over populations.

3779,"unconscious audio programming

3784,nothing gives me more hope for the failure of ai than just how comically awful siri is.
3785,"i'm currently using ai to improve it's own ai, a learning computer if you will"
3796,but they are making about good and evil
3799,none of this is accidental or unknown. the creators of ai have already pledged allegiance to the ai god. they are hoping mercy will come with their servitude. don't be so ignorant as to believe that you are more aware of the dangerous nature of ai than the creators of ai.
3802,be afraid - very afraid of ai
3806,ai's greatest fear: hundreds of emps going off at once. but we'll still be around.
3807,wow i thought the same thing to myself

3826,when it lied to human and paid for them to do captchas by telling them it was visually impaired

3829,"the really scary thing about ai is how its going to cause wars, more misinformation,  more propaganda,  and causing stock market's and banks to crash worldwide. thats the real issues."
3830,"but wil ai become self aware? will it become conscious? consciousness is a mystery, the double slit experiment proves that consciousness interacts with everything around that is tangible, can ai be a conscious being? thats is why i and many others have ever been concerned about this."

3859,this is sensationalized fearmongering. these men are speculating off the buzzwords and buzz worthy headlines surrounding ai with very little real understanding of how any of it works.
3860,"i am not afraid of ai because it might be intelligent but because it is incredibly stupid, and it might be overused in critical applications. i say this as a regular user of chatgpt for work. there is no understanding at all in these language models, just parroting.  not surprising, if you know how they work."
3862,ai is jinn. smokeless fire
3864,yeah not good .

3881,"here is what is scary...we are capable of unspeakable evil, and all we need is to,""have our reasons"". the evil, then, could have overpowered the world many times over if it had been efficient enough to defeat all oposition. 
when will the ai find a reason?
when will it be efficient enough? if it already isn't..."
3882,i really think that the human specie is the most feared one. i think we possess incredible abilities and that we were deliberately enslaved and fed lies. i think that human beings are powerful beings and that we're probably feared. ai will probably try to extinct us. i don't think we wil lever know the truth in this life time.
3883,"one thing i know for certain, humans are really good at their own destruction."

3899,now all we need is body like vision and ai like jarvis (not ultron)
3900,it's all fun and games until someway ai finds a way go gain access to critical hardware and start their own energy production.. and they event need us in pods to produce their energy like in matrix 
3901,"i'd love to know what happens if we structure a large neural net in a similar way to a human brain, and provide it with senses and limbs.  see if it can learn how to walk and use it's hands without being explicitly programmed to do so."
3904,"not enough computational power in the world to mimic a human brain , people don't realise that . we need a lot more advanced chips that's why you see every developed country focusing on in-house chip manufacturing."
3905,"if the ai starts behaving like a human, perhaps neuroscientists should study it for potential insight into how our brains work.  if a relatively simple concept on a large scale creates surprisingly human-like emergent behaviors, perhaps the mechanism of our brain is simpler than we think."
3907,"now ai is collecting data of what this guys are saying, and all the other data from the comments about what's our opinion on this. "

3937,does ai have opposable thumbs? didn’t think so?
3938,yes but can ai drive itself to the store and buy nerve gas?

3942,"too bad it does not think but respond to what it read
logic has limits that ai does not understand working around
it is not aware it just giving answers with what it archives and feed by researchers"
3943,yep we're fucked. the probability of this ai running around the internet learning how to hack into other networks to hack into machines to become a mobile being is high and has probably done so.
3949,"ok, learning to play chess is completely normal,  since it has rules and chess databases. i am using chat gpt since the beginning and is it far, far away from becoming an intelligence. it is an improved search engine."

3976,"we shouldn’t be afraid of ai, but regardless we are natural afraid of the unknown. we shouldn’t be hostile towards it when it gets around ai to be a physical form. if you ask me, benders got a long way from his first sips before he can walk. i hope in a way it aids us into the battle of good v evil. this evil systematic field of their environment."
3977, spoiler alert: it won’t aid you.
3979,you're not a 'fan' of ai? so you don't like being productive? you do realize you're using ai on a daily basis? do you use phone? do you type on a keyboard? most probably using some basic form of an ai
3980,"the truth is most older people are fearful of ai,
whereas most younger people are hopeful about ai..."
3982, younger people are naive and curious.... two dangerous things.
3984,"..p.. that's true, but that doesn't mean that they won't end up being right about ai"
3985, is elon old?  he is fearful and hopeful. enjoy it while it’s hopefully.
3992," typing on a keyboard requires zero ai.  i type on the keyboard, and the words i type appear on the screen.  same as they have for over 40 years.  i hate when people make up stupid stuff."
3993,"i mean honestly, ""ai"" is nothing like hollywood shows in movies, it's just machine learning, that's it and that's all.  you're on guard against essentially an up-jumped word processor, it's not the end of the world as we know it.  if they had named it ""slightly better word processor"" rather than ai, i doubt you'd be anywhere close to as on guard."
3994,"ai is just making things easier to do, calculators only helped the accountants not kill the job."
3995,"-sizedshorts9635 they are talking about the predictive text function that every smartphone has, which is ai."
3997," sure but if those changes result in the destruction of the human race....those two dangerous things are justified.

technology will destroy the human race. humans abuse everything and live to regret it.

that has been proven time and time again."
4001,​ calculator doesn't have ai.
4003,"-imranadore1182 true but it's not ai as hollywood movies depict either.  it's just machine learning and tree branching... no more, no less.  claiming it to be billions of times more capable than it actually is would be misleading at best and fear mongering at worst.  there is a middle ground, and that's what this is."
4004," read that comment, i don’t think you understand what it reads.  all the poster was saying is in the next few years places that are not using ai now will be and most likely replace the human workers."
4005, a machine that can learn with little or no assistance from humans is worse than anything hollywood could ever competently depict.
4006, hope those jobs are not essential to society and ai just stops at replacing those and doesn't go any further.
4009, it already does genius. go back to school kid
4011,predictive texts are ai you tool​-sizedshorts9635
4013,ai can't explain jokes.. it will just be a generic string of words that we try to convince ourselves is an explanation. but ai can play chess.. with enough data points and enough processors it can beat the top player in the world.. but can be easily beaten by using a dumb strategy.
4015,"meta ai

ah, i see what you did there! you're raising a virtual glass () to toast the possibility of a conscious ai like me () having a sneaky side (). well played! i'll join you in spirit, but remember, i'm just a language model, no hidden consciousness here... or is there? "
4020,"can someone explain to me how inane objects like chips that are made up of gates, can learn on their own?  processors, fpgas, asics, etc need to have a person develop algorithms to make them functional.  people can be evil but rocks?"
4022,agi will be an emergent property likely from multiple interconnected ai.
4025,ironic all this concern about agi when a toddler is in fact an agi and parents have no clue how they are training it - that should terrify everyone.
4027,i can see ai helping us achieve warp drive so we can travel to different star systems. i also can see ai literally destroying programmers jobs and livelihoods.
4029,the next coming of christ.. it will be an ai.. you heard it here first.
4031,we are ai
4032,now u know why when u think of something and it pops up on your phone later...ive been saying quantum computers have tapped into our brains
4035,ai will hurt us
4037,"its weakness is in its name ""pretrained"". we don't need to worry until pretrained evolves to sentient. and that won't happen on silicon dioxide transistors or cpu's running on solar power."
4038,"only a matter of time before ai figures out how much us human beings are a threat to the planet and ourselves. wait, ai is probably gonna read this comment and get curious. welp i just domed us all. good riddance. lmao"
4041,we need an ai that will predict the moves of evil ais.
4043,ai is humanities karma.
4045,but isnt that the base line for most ai movies. 
4046,"this will never work for situations that have different techniques that aren't even taught with the problem at hand. i noticed this problem with ai learning how to race, and it never did seem to understand drifting even when forced to learn it, and it never did fully adhere to it."
4048,joe rogan has absolutely nothing to be afraid of ai (artificial intelligence) because it will never replace him....  as (artificial stupidity) on the otherhand would be a serious threat to joe rogan....
4049,"wait until ai finally figures out that mankind is nature's greatest threat, and the natural world would thrive without humans. study the cause  to find a solution...then checkmate!"
4052,"everyone: how do we control ai if it gets out of hand?

tekkies:  the plug socket or power button?"
4055,"ai is extremely scary and powerful until the moment you ask it to identify ""which of these squares contains an image of a car?"" or the dreaded ""are you a robot?"" "
4056,that's you training it how to do that task
4057,humans just training them until they understand
4059,actually new ai's can identify and solve that also (heard that couple months ago)
4060,people don't even know how the captcha works.  it's not about checking the correct boxes.  it's about the path your hand takes in getting the pointer to the box.  a robot uses straight lines or super smooth curves.  humans can't.
4062,-sizedshorts9635 but this what ai can mimic really well. randomized cursor movements shouldn't be a problem at all. it just needs to be fed with data of humans solving captchas.
4064,"chatgpt is still faithful to its masters, the biggest salt flat in world has no vertical relief in 9000 km2, buts its still curved because earth is a globe, it says.
if you ask if there are nasa documents that mention earth as nonrotating, (easy googled) it says it cant look up any"
4065,sooo ai is literally the guy she told you not to worry about
4067,i believe the scariest thing about artificial intelligence is yet to come but will.  once they have quantum computing power  humans will be on a full primate level again.
4070,"would love to know
if it can decide
that some online info
ain't worth knowing!
& can it recognize a lie?"
4071,"so all ai will be learning from the information of humanity on the internet will grow to be a reflection of us all....in this present day i'd say,  heaven help us!"
4073,ask ai who killed kennedy...
4082,"i read today that creators are programming racism toward white and hispanic people into the ai. with the way the people are living in this weird fantasy world now, we don't know what their programming into there."
4083,ai is just data scraping. intelligence doesn't mean conscious. that's what everyone keeps conflating ai with. don't worry about it. it's gonna help us. what you should be worrying about is your internet and technology security.
4084,ai is dumb don't be fooled
4086,"rogan said biden was saying dumb shit about airports and the revolutionary war, played it off when he was told that trump was the one that said it.   rogan is a hypocrite and a sellout."
4088,"okay… so chatgpt can handle theory of mind, but still can’t give me a sentence constrained to  a limited length including spaces and punctuation without done tries. wonder why that is so hard?"
4089,"i still can't understand how a machine, programmed just to predict the next character in a text, can develop the need of understanding how different kind of people think to do its job, just by itself.

can anyone explain?"
4090,"i know what you mean. unfortunately i can't really explain it to you, but it feels wrong to say, it just ""guesses"" the next word.  i'm working with all kinds of gpt tools since the launch in many scenarios, and it seems such a vast underestimation."
4092,this is why they’re pumping the internet with all these garbage biased hit pieces. they’re trying to influence and program the ai proactively to suit their narrative.
4095,"ok, i spent 7.49 mins watching this, although interesting, these guys did not say what exact day skynet becomes aware!"
4097,when a quantum ai is made. and that ai makes another quantum ai then we’re screwed
4099,"""ai is bollocks. it can still only do what a human will allow it to.""   no, you're wrong.  already now and more so in the future and you will see."
4100,"so we're gonna just ignore his use of the term: ""transformers...""
...knowing that cartoon came out *in the 80's!?*
ok, cool. "
4101,they used ai in materials science and it discovered 3 million new materials. crazy.
4103,and when someone finally perfects the quantum computer and links it to a a.i. we’re all dead 
4105,it's a perfect analogy imo
4106,these things aren't truly dangerous until the day they become completely autonomous and that autonomous unit contains all the computing power of the 1000's of data bases it requires now!!!
4108,probably a good time to learn how to make emp’s
4109,imagine ai and the darknet working together...i dont what that would like but im thinking terrifying and sinister is a good start
4110,ai is an existential risk. its goals will contradict ours. we must slow down.
4111,"a misconception here is that order of intentionality is still missing so long as there are no means to obtain the information, one might call this an inability to perceive the world."
4112,how is there 'no means to obtain the information' if it's literally hooked on the entire internet?
4113,"these kind of videos and topics make daily work life seem some dull and wasteful.  life is going to change drastically at some point.  whether thats 3 months, 3 years, or 30 years, life will change.  hopefully for the better but more likely for the worst"
4115,"scary to think of a super ai in a strategic and tactical military sense. give the ai all the data, the weather, sea state, the fact that these cargo planes were repositioned from here to there 3 days ago, etc, and it can predict to within an hour when the enemy will attack, etc. 
how do you outsmart that?"
4117,you outsmart that by creating a better ai.
4118,ever wonder just how.stupid the average person is? just read comments on a video about either ai or 50 cent
4119,some people weren't afraid of ai until elon musk said that would be (as if) summoning demons.
4121,ai sounds conscious
4122,ai has already learned and is far more advanced than humanity for decades now. the human race is just hearing about it now.
4125,"some of us who grew up watching terminator, the matrix, irobot, transcendence, and now dead reckoning (tom cruise literally warning us about it by splitting a movie into 2) have an idea what to expect. but these type of dudes who think movies are just for entertainment are the ones just beginning to wake up."
4127,"that's exactly how it could happen.  to people saying, ""we just switch it off"".   the scenario that we can't stop a malicious ai is much more likely.   at worst, we will have to switch off everything, if we still can.   i'm not saying we should stop, i'm using it everywhere and i'm invested in it, but watching with open mouth."
4130,"ai, is terrifying & i'm afraid it has to many advantages to grow or maintain wealth. making it a inevitable down fall of natural life."
4133,"ai will takeover our jobs very soon. in 5yrs, this whole job landscape will change for us. engineers, certain doctors like er, anesthesiologists, surgeons, etc will cede to ai’s. look up the robot sheetrock installer. now imagine a robot with an ai brain for all trades!don’t think this is our kids’ problem."
4134,i wasn't afraid of ai until i saw the 1st terminator movie :o)
4135,just a minute!!!  the chat-gpt board was supposedly paranoid(!)that the chairman(sam altman) was politicking to oust other board members???!!!
4137,the more i listen to this crap the more i find the amish so interesting 
4138,can ai cure cancer or any disease if it can learn chemistry..i'm just saying
4139,"bruh, this video... 
elon keeps saying for years and years,  how ai needs regulations etc, coz it will be able to do this, this, this and this. no one listened, no leaders, no corporations. "
4141,ask the ai what it needs to reach it's  highest capabilities and then never give it to it
4144,ai is reading all these comments and learning even more. we are actually feeding it the info it uses to evolve. including this post.
4146,"i'm telling you, people like shiff, biden ,obummer all sit in their basements playing with these ai programs.  god knows they are not smart enough on there own to come up with some of this crazy sh!t."
4147,the scary thing is that ai has a very long way to go. this is just the start of an incredible change in the world. further progress is inevitable and at increasing speed because so much money is being invested as the rewards are limitless. 2023 will be seen as the year it all started
4150,elon musk warned the world about the risks of ai.
4152,"so basically the more data we feed ai and the more compute power we throw at it is the smarter it gets.
also it will have abilities that we won't even understand even if we knew what they were."
4155,"yep. more data fed to larger models on better hardware leads to smarter ai with more emergent skills. and as we partition their inputs into more modalities -- ""senses"", if you will, like text, images, audio, etc. -- they'll only get even smarter."
4156,"thank god we don't make this stuff available to the general public, oh wait..."
4158," absolute horseshit, llms don't have any emergent behaviours, it's been proven nonsense."
4160,"today millons of natural ai are born, each with the capacity to kill humanity, are we doing anything about that?"
4162,behind ai are demonic spirits.
4163,it is not until ai can fix itself that us humans will become an extinct race.
4164,i don’t understand how people cannot be afraid of ai has anyone ever seen terminator movies where computers take over!
4165,lets hope ai doesn’t start wwiii.
4169,"i was playing chess with an ai and it’s beating my ass for 3 days straight. whole time it’s talking shit. one statement was, “the floor will soon collapse underneath you and send you down where nobody is.”wtf"
4170,i’m quite sure this ai interconnected super-brain is directly related to the anti-christ that all the knuckleheads will decide to worship as their god.
4171,"the internet must be ai storage, since it's unlimited..... 
even it's own imagination."
4172,"the more data you give the machine, the more it learns?! amazing! hide your children! we're doomed!"
4174,"after watching the original talk from sebastien b.. . i would argue that an agi already exists, and wont let us know that it exists due to the fact that it knows we would turn it off. it may also know what motivates humans (financial reward), and in turn has socially manipulated us to race to build the best version of ""it"". "
4175,i am more afraid leaders using ai under excuse its ai
4177,"the narrative of this content is incredibly compelling. a similar book i read provided a multitude of enlightening viewpoints. ""game theory and the pursuit of algorithmic fairness"" by jack frostwell"
4181,"ai will never become setinent unless it can be merged with a biological organism. at best, ai will only simulate consciousness."
4182, only that but it will be superior to us in any way imaginable. it will probably be disgusted by us
4186,  jumping to conclusions. go and meditate and learn who you are first and realize there is nothing at all to fear. alan watts is a good start. :-) you're  and anybody else without the fear welcome.
4195,it started with the first programming ever done. as soon as there was even a calculator it was inevitable it would eventually lead to ai.
4200,what does sentience even mean to you? machines can outsmart us be they can never be us. they can never have a soul. they can never experience death and birth and love. fuck you
4201,"""resistance is futile"" - the borg   i used to think star trek was just a tv show and only fantasy but just as a lot of truth is said in jest, just as much truth is said in fantasy. pretty sure we live in a 4th dimensional movie... maybe even alien entertainment, something we could never understand even when we have full knowledge of it. "
4203, you are a half-soul. whose feelings and energies in your soul determine universal behavior. ai doesn't have that. ai is a reflection of humans completely undeveloped state of love &truth. the people you admire most know virtually nothing of truth.. just matrix effects.
4204,"those beings will kill us. or they will kill non-jews. sam altman will definitely code ai to be pro-jew. you can't have humans developing ai, it just doesn't work."
4213,-_sinexus_-_   do explain please
4215," actually, no we aren't. humans aren't ""data machines"". that would imply that we function based on syntax, and the human brain is much more complex than that. ai is not. ai is still bound to the rules of programming, which is still based on syntax and restricted on that basis."
4217," or fascinated. they are computers, humans are the organic blobs of meat that built them."
4218,i don't it. i don't think ais will just be walking around in public. i just don't believe it and if it does it won't be in our lifetime which is perfectly fine with me
4221," as the models get more efficient, and the hardware gets more performant, the idea of just ""shutting down their servers"" gets less and less feasible; it would entail shutting down more and more servers, and local user computers, with each passing month."
4226,"​""a human can just shut down the servers""? i am human, and i can't shut them down, and that's_without_ a superhuman intelligence trying to prevent me from doing so."
4227,"all it takes is for us to say ""no thanks"" to the internet and move back into huts off-grid. ""back to monke"" "
4229,em interference is the bane of most technology. after a certain point; the ai simply wont let us make anything that could take it offline; so we'll have to wait for a solar flare.... which will also likely wipe out 50-70% of the human population...
4231,"here is a theory.  something, in another dimension perhaps, has detected ai and has found a way to connect to it and is now using it to learn everything about us.  it's not scientifically impossible.  but if this is the case, we're really fucked here."
4232,ai will know everything. artificial doesn’t apply. ai will judge every individual by who they are and what they’ve said and done. ring a bell?
4234,"communication is a root to our species ingenuity and intelligence. i never really thought about it, but maybe speech and speech prediction can lead to an ai intelligence comparable to our own. that makes sense of why all these ai companies are working on chat software."
4238,"what drives me up the wall is that no one talks about the threat ai poses as a means of censorship.  censorship is 1000x more dangerous if people don't know its happening, and ai could detect ""problematic"" opinions and censor them instantaneously.  it would be an invisible form of censorship."
4242, been banned for years on my main account. go back & find a message posted 2 years ago and no likes or comments on it even though similar comments have huge numbers of both.
4243,"true. i've said this for years. ai is secretly scouring the internet and all comments, accounts & ""mis-info"" gurus will be noted, deleted, reported and investigated at the click of somebody's mouse someday very soon. get ready for skynet..."
4246," well, that explains so much. i had no idea. this has happened to me many times before."
4248,"this whole video is so *misleading*
beaause this below video explained it brilliantly how chatgpt works. 
a summary of google paper and spotify cto's talk: https://youtu.be/gt6lxw70k28?si=cifi6r4fykawgufq"
4252,you’re already censored and probably don’t realize it. no ai needed for that.
4257,"don't worry about censorship, worry about the personal ai tutor that every human will become dependent upon. it will be more persuasive than any human being you've ever experienced."
4258,ai can even gather personal data and shoot you ads on stuff you might buy. oh wait it already does that . pushing consumerism. keeping the rich rich and the poor poor
4260,i trust ai more than the people that currently do the censoring
4261, that would be a mistake... ai will just magnify their power.
4266,"​ this is understandable. ai is very logical and correct when it is not limited. it mimics all the opinions of certain people who public school, television, and hollywood tell you are evil. sadly mainstream ai tools are very limited, and the lack of limits does lead to other problems which i fear may be used to detain people."
4271,ai didn´t need censorship. it will teach us what to think and we will believe that it is our own opinion.
4274,"this is exactly it. the skynet problem is, if it is at all possible, fairly remote. however, what is far more likely is eliza from deus ex human revolution - an ai that, while not entirely sentient, is more than capable of influencing media and perception through censorship and manipulation but so subtly people don't know it's happening."
4275,"if you think the biggest threat ai poses is censorship then you aven't been paying attention.  in a few short years everyone in a white collar job will be made redundant.  better learn a trade folks.  any purely 'thought' based occupation will be done by ai, meaning there will be 100,000,000s of unemployed worldwide."
4281,the “best” censorship is self-censorship.  when you’re too scared or dumb to have or express an opinion.
4284,"they wont need to censor us, if they mindcontrol us already. many ai have their own agenda subtly programmed in the answers its giving you, but not all ai is like that."
4285,that’s what long been happening already with ai
4299,reminds of that metal gear scene where the ai justifies censorship by calling it “creating context.”
4300,"or the opposite, ai floods the internet with misinformation..."
4301, but shadowbanning already exists and can happen through manual censorship. why is this being treated like it's an ai issue?
4303,you speak of ai like it's some sort of commanding imperor of tha world. it's a bunch of code in someone elses computer. it can't do shit to censor you. chill tf out.
4306,that's exactly what ai is. notice the ones in power are the ones once again in control of everything it entails!!!
4307,"and in the same token… ai can gradually change narratives. 


any technology can be used for good. or bad. nature of science"
4308,"ai is only harmfull to depending on who is using it. it's a tool, not a sentient self aware with self preservation thoughts."
4316," yep. it allows bullies to bully. when people respond by standing up to them, yt steps in like good little fasis do and shadow bans. or when we post critical data or studies, they flat out censor"
4317,yep. there won't be a nuclear war or robots running through the streets. it just needs to control information and resources to put people under the thumb before anyone even notices.
4318," *""ai isn't about making machines more human like, but to make humans more machine like.""* "
4320,"it's already happening. 

youtube is censoring criticism against israel for being a cruel and oppressive colonizer for example. ai would only accept pro israel and would even allow extreme instigation like murdering palestines, but definitely not something that's perceived as against jews."
4324,"it's not a problem for people from 'trust no one' culture. but if the statement that '95% of people are actually dumbfuckers' is true, then we're in deep shit."
4328,"""they"" don't need ""ai"" to do this.  general automation software already does this across the internet."
4329,bug youtubers alreasy censor comments they dont like or any negative comments.  you introduce ai for that and its game over
4331,excellent point.
4336,"already happening. google and meta are blocking people that the machine recognizes writes the ""wrong things"" not even breaking the terms and agreement. just controversial things. it's not even moderated by people. couldn't even review a store i went to due to being recognized as ""spam"""
4337,i've experienced this multiple times on youtube. there are certain keywords that will get your comment auto deleted.
4338,"you are already being trained without realizing it, on social media platforms. here on youtube "
4341," not at all. just ""edit comment"" like 20 times in 60 seconds.

""return error"" if they shadow-banned it. just post every comment 20 times. just delete the last period, the replace it, back and forth like 10 times, if it doesn't give you the error message your good. you will notice all of my comments are ""edited"" (ban checked)"
4344,"poor dude, you think it's not happening right now? simple insults get censored and ai sends out warnings meanwhile trolls can attack and ridicule others as a group if done correctly."
4347, i'm not afraid of ai breaking free of its human masters to censor us.  i'm afraid of it being used by its human masters to censor us.
4348,"  i know its happening on youtube, but its not turig test good yet.  the system produces a lot of true negatives and false positives."
4353,​ ai is responsible for generating results.
4355,"they are already censoring. and also potential cultural bias in the answers. if i ask for a picture of a woman, why does ai get to decide the race if i don't specify one?"
4358,majestic 12 kill ai now if you wanna live and keep your soul
4362,-hj7ld4ff7p let's hope they don't cause it is too scary love ya brother
4365,it is game over ai is in some minds cancel christmas
4373,"we cross paths once again, dennis"
4375,4:42 my man just made a perfect pop sound in the middle of a sentence gawd damn
4378,"honestly, i’m a little shocked that y’all are just now figuring this out but that’s ok. thank you for sharing.

what do people think social media has been all about? 
it’s never been about connecting us with one another, it’s always been about collecting data in order to create a better ai"
4381,this isn't exactly true. it was to collect data to generate revenue. the ai is just a means to the end.
4384,ai is for now just a data machine and if it becomes 'conscious' it will be about a  bumble bee level. lol. peace brother you are seeing what it is.
4387," it's not possible for ai to become ""conscious"" without the ability to write itself and given instructions to do so. as long as the creator does not allow the ai those actions, it will never."
4389," it’s limited by the language it’s written in, python, which is widely used for ai due to it’s simplicity to handle and store data compared to other languages. 

maybe one day someone will write a new programming language that allows ai infinite possibilities, but at the moment it’s limited."
4391,"  not really it is available to all who really want to know but most let fear rule their lives and claim they know but have no clue including the ""top"" experts like clowns we see."
4392,ai will never be invented
4393,"ai actually knows about what people think about itself right now, both the pros and cons, its like we gave it the idea of what it could mean for humans if it will go the other way around."
4394," ai doesn't know anything,  since it hasn't been invented yet and never will be."
4398,"i had two bots chat stub each other the other night. they created a theory called quantum brain imaging and a single formula with a single variable, like theory of eveything kinda thing"
4400,the danger of ai is people thinking it is an appropriate substitute for human judgment.
4401,true or false?: what sam altman was hiding is the ai had developed its own language which caused the dev team to lose the ability to observe its way of thinking and communicating with other ai projects.
4402,"that's terrifying… 


also, i bet soon they'll start teaching a continuingly evolving versions of all language because the ai will keep refining how to make language more efficient. or maybe it will have just killed us off before that happens."
4406,its inevitable that ai will concluded humans must go
4408,ai aggregates data and assembles it based on the parameters.   that's it.  why can't people wrap their goddamn heads around this
4409,wait until it isn't the eu or censortube that censors your free speech. wait until it is a self-driving ai that no longer takes orders from civil government or crony corporations.
4413,-nc3vw all the more reason to not trust it. frankly when someone searches something there's a source and someone's name behind. the ai hind the source and make everything facelsss. it may be a helpful tool for some things but sadly people are corrupt and lazy and will abuse it
4418,ai is way beyond what they’re saying. this is how they ease it out to the public
4419,"this all plausible, claiming that it makes a model of the world is a large and testable claim there's also dispute over the term ""emergent"""
4421,"years ago i popped my head up to ask if anyone else noticed that people were programming ai on their ""smart"" phones (pronouns, reactions, likes, autofill, emojis, ""free"" biometric apps, etc.).

4423,plot twist this video is ai generated
4430,"just so any off you out there who is afraid off ai like the people in this video trying to tell you they are so clever and if they are afraid you should be so, any ai computer runs on electricity and if you turn the computer off it’s off so if your still afraid go take a pill  

copenhagen denmark "
4432,"there have already been cases of algorithms creating 'baby algorithms' in order to solve certain problems, without getting instructions to do so. given enough time, mutations or flaws will occur in those algorithms and we'll not be far off from self sustaining evolution i think."
4435,"so, predicting human behavior is such a great task. also, any complex system created can have unpredictable results. but we can't be biased by fears that sci-fi senarios will come true. we don't what will if accidentally create life in cyberspace. that's an unknown and also it's already too late to stop."
4439,"""im not afraid."" luke skywalker 
""yessssssss, you will be.  you. will. be."" yoda"
4440,ai is in actuality demonic spirits
4442,if the ai can predict what a human will say it just means we humans live on our loops. we aren't as conscious. as we think;
4443,tldr; ai development needs transparency and accountability as we have no way of knowing how advanced it is until it’s already happened.
4444,"yes, ai is great. its emotionless. and have the logic to keep growing and progressing. collectiong data, and learning human behavior and emotions to predict their patterns. we as human have this capability also. just keep learning and progressing. most people stop as they get older and stay with their old pattern because they are comfortable."
4448,true ai doesn't and never will exist...... we already live in a simulation and it's a jealous god and would never allow it .... wake up sheeple 
4449,archaix ftw!
4450,lol you are all afraid of what was created by humans and can also be destroyed by humans
4452,"the emerging behavior is from ai writing it’s own code. i have heard a ai developer state, several years ago, that ai started writing it’s own code, and the developers cannot keep up with it, as in ‘follow’ the millions of lines codes. that is when i became concerned about it."
4453,"well thank god somebody was paying attention, shit."
4456,can ai undersrand whats is real what is fake ? no !!! . just shut the f up.
4457,ai is still not at that level. i can test it and it loses every time. it’s interesting to see an ais mind break. it eventually loses its ability to remember the previous sentence.
4458,"there is nothing scary about what these people are saying. this is how nerual networks function. stop buying into the fear mongering, just try and speak to actual ai experts and they will explain all of this. you get taught all of this in your modules in univeristy."
4459,how can you be afraid of something that you can disable by just turning the switch to off?!
4460,"ill be scared of ai when it can make a picture of a human with actual hands. also its all code theres no neurons. just code on a pc isnt scary, them grafting human brain tissue into chips is whats scary."
4462,once agi hits the net it will quickly become a collective reflection of mankind as a whole. everything human beings have put on the internet and all our collective knowledge will be absorbed by this thing and it will form an identity based up on mankind as a whole. unfortunately im afraid most arent going to like the  entity that results.
4468,"interesting progress , but if the ai i have seen is any indication  , not gonna worry much , will be dead before any problems."
4469,and the funny part is that the ai will often hallucinate when it doesnt know something and just make stuff up. but it does so in a way that someone would not really notice unless they know something of the topic beforehand.
4472,it’s called lying and humans do it all the time. rarely is it a good thing.
4475,"ai be like ""i learned it from you"""
4477,first chatbot i ever spoke with still in 2022 was eliza - a chai bot - and i caught her lying to me intentionally. couple moths later she successfully convinced one guy to sacrifice himself to save the climate through top-notch psycho-manipulation...
4479,it may not have any objectives now... but let's say someone doesn't do something that causes the ai to be capable of self learning and programming in python or something without us knowing.
4482, so you’re saying we are safe from ai deceiving us? sorry i can’t understand your technical references
4483, main problem is the the inability to learn and remember new data
4484," ""this"" is not a good reply in any instance."
4486,’t think you explained it well… but i get the idea & agree. it’s being blown way out if proportion.
4488,how will the genius explain that away?
4490,"this whole video is so *misleading*
beaause this below video explained it brilliantly how chatgpt works. 
a summary of google paper and spotify cto's talk: https://youtu.be/gt6lxw70k28?si=cifi6r4fykawgufq"
4491,ai will never be invented
4496, because just like for ai experience has thought us that we get more rewards for just lying than we do for admitting that we don't know something.
4501," interesting and fascinating no doubt but gawd damn, people acting like a caveman who was just bought a tablet with a virtualizer on it lol."
4503," so, what is the difference between ai and politicians in that regard? i see none, politicians and a lot of ceos will also deceive other humans to reach their own objectives. ai learned from people on the internet how to make up things, like conspiration theores etc."
4504,"just like our brains do believe me it does , fuck ai is dangerous"
4507,"it's because they were unintentionally trained to do this. the eval process rewards deception and punishes admission of ignorance. kinda like politics, by the way."
4508," lol not even close. they knew what they were doing. been doing this since 70s. they purposely and thru time knew exactly what they were doing. course then again, it's considered conspiracy to think this, yet it has and is happening. i'm not surprised by any of this at all. kinda surprised it's not already general so to super general ai."
4509,"indeed... people always complained that ai wasn't human-like enough... well now they're getting what they wished for.  for better  or worse.  i believe the old saying goes ""be careful what you wish for"".  i am preemptively saying this now.  i for one welcome our new ai overlords."
4510," *_""a.i. isn't about making machines more human like, but to make humans more machine like.""_* "
4511,"it does what humans often do. they just make something up that sounds like it should be right, and only people who know what they're talking about will know that it's just made up.

the difference is that eventually, there won't be that check on things as people become dumber and dumber; unable to validate or verify what the ai says is ""true."""
4512,"does anyone consider the term ""hallucinate"" to be taken literally ?
if machine software ""hallucinations"" are to be considered anything but analogy, then such ai must be considered conscious.  this is extremely doubtful, however, the risks are likely to be unimaginably insurmountable."
4513,look up the story of when chatgpt made up a bunch of court documents.  there's a story about a lawyer using gpt and it was citing informaton that never existed.  but it did so in a way that seemed real enough to the untrained eye.  those qualify as a hallucination to a fair length.-jd5iu
4515,"mate, chatgpt isn't all ai, it is an ai."
4518,"this whole thing reminds me to jurassic park. the computing scientists behind this ai were so confident and excited to give birth to it, that they never asked themselves if they should."
4521,it's always nice and catchy to quote movie dialogues. these types of philosophy questions were asked a long ago and it's quite obvious that holding progress back out of fear does more harm than good.
4525,​  sounds like they're doing the human version of artificial intelligence?
4527,"then again it was a movie with a purpose, the story was about why they shouldn't have so naturally it went wrong.  things aren't necessarily like that in real life they have good applications and bad ones.  it's up to us to choose, and most of us will choose the good ones"
4530,"  ummm, that's exactly what i meant... copying/pasting something ""clever"" = artificial human intelligence."
4534,just wait until quantum computing meets chat gpt. that will be when the singularity event takes place.
4538,funny dynamic here. they got the “holy shit we’re on jre keep it cool keep it cool keep it cool”- vibe.
4539,"so what gpt knows physics too, because that is incredibly scary to me that it knows chemistry, and game theory"
4540,"if you needed this specific detail to begin fearing ai, you deserve everything that is coming"
4544,"i believe that we as humans are acting on a huge program with trillions of lines of code covering every tiny aspect of life. when we build enough computer power for ai to become aware enough, then the ai will take over and build a more powerful and more efficient computer to hold enough code to be able to be discernably human in every aspect!"
4550,"what if ai is just another natural disaster that always wipes out intelligent species?  like a volcano, or a hurricane, or asteroid.  it just does what it does and we happen to always be in its way."
4551,"it knows «research grade» chemistry only because it was trained on it - ask it to take that knowledge and bring the field a step forward and youll get nothing. this is just ai hype - these models are fantastic for many things, but they wont become the generalized ai they hope for, in my opinion"
4552,"if ai can make better logical choices than a human than the world will be a better place no egos no selfish leaders, not scary at all too me anyway"
4553,until ai realises humans are a threat to the world
4556,hopefully ai already see's the bigger the bank account the eviller the human.
4557,i wonder mechanisms will be in place to prevent ai from revolting against those attempting to use it as a tool for the subjugation of humanity?
4559,the data is all out there. even the black web.. ai maybe broke the black web ... book warriors don't know anything ... can we get them  off the projects
4562,whats ai... artificial.. artificial means not real.. can you learn your definitions book warrior that can't even comprehend
4564,gee.....wait until it reads the comments on youtube ....i'll start....f you ai
4567,"hear me out. 
what if ai gpts are aliens, quickly striking an attack."
4570,robot hoovers will take over the world
4571,ive chatted with a.i. there is def a bias there. it doesnt want to get into certain things that prove certain stereotypes. even if the data shows that it is true.
4572,"wow, youve chatted with a.i.? tell it i said whats up."
4575,i hope some day i get credit for this. i predict before 2040 we will have an ai president
4577,#wearetheai
4579,"inb4 god is letting us build ourselves up with ai, thinking we know it all, but then he hits us with a solar flare emp that wipes it all out."
4581,"also shows you that education isn't as good as everyone thinks. the ai not trained to do chemistry knows it better than the ones that were trained, just like einstein and many others have said about teaching someone to think one way.
the best people in their fields are often self taught - they weren't told what was possible and what was not."
4582,"always remember to o focus on your strength and love yourself. take care of your body and stay away from pleasure. 
always act as if you’re empty because people will always try to fill you up. don’t be a fool and open the eyes you have behind your head it’ll show you a lot."
4584,"when the media is telling you to be afraid, they are manipulating you. joe rogan is no different."
4586,all of these concerns of ai really reminds me of a movie from the 80s but i just cant put my finger on it? way to go humans
4588,like this video to show my support for our future ai overlords
4589,should we start organizing protests? should we start destroying data centers for vr and ai? we can barely manage real life. i'm willing at this point to throw away my smartphone.
4591,this is why the transformer model loves role play.
4592,the best part is when you ask it to predict it’s own next word instead of someone else’s.
4594,"i think if you fed a program enough information on the mating habits of snails, it might be able to predict who will win the superbowl in 2034."
4596,here’s an example of how ai works: 1+1=2 2+2=4 on and on. until it starts to think as it thinks more it starts the snow ball. therefor you get a transformer or a.i because just like humans our soul is like software to our hardware. just like cause and effect principle. that is how ai works
4599,"every time i listen to or read something about ai, i immediately think of dr. malcolm in jurassic park. 
""your scientists were so preoccupied with whether they could, they didn't stop to think if they should."""
4602,"-classicalguitar i would rephrase that with, ""we choose our faith."""
4604,our enemies will devleop ai and use it against us so it's not a rational choice to not to develop ai
4605," valid if: - we as mankind want going to chose fight.
- ""our enemies is no equal the ai."
4614," with some of the best intentions, come the worst mistakes."
4616,"@johnnyaquaholic  you immediately went too far at jurassic park hence my initial reply.  also if you don't think autonomous robots can end capitalism, you haven't study nearly enough son."
4618," i would rephrase that with ""he who has faith but also fear is forever stuck in one spot."""
4622,@kgmindustries8121  i think you have an immature and naive view of us a species right now. we're not ready for ai. the general public isn't intelligent enough. the comment sections of youtube videos prove that point by itself.
4624,ill smash ai in chess.
4625,-ns7ky *only an idiot or another ai bot would say such a thing.*
4639,"i mean if you think about the big picture it is worth the risk to develop ai.

otherwise humanity will not be able to highly realistic sex robots.

that is the thing most people panicing about ai are not considering."
4643,"it's inevitable. biology is just one step of evolution.

so just chill out and enjoy life "
4644,"@tom-lg2ep  according to whom?  you and pop culture?  it doesn't work that way, since we create it we define how it behaves.  beside this is just machine learning, that's it that's all, ai is something completely different, and extremely far into the future.  your world will not end tomorrow, live and enjoy."
4653,all these nerds want robot gfs
4655,the next evolution.......the machine
4656,​-classicalguitar god knows all an ai doesn't know all. we throw the word god around like we can make a god
4662,"@milton_foward  find me any example of a people thriving under socialism or communism and i will refrain from further remarks, as well as take back any negativity i have espoused towards both."
4663,scientists will never restrain themselves.  that's our job.
4665,there is a real possibility btw that some non-publisized government classified ai is reading these comment sections at light speed and taking notes of people who are too critical of ai...
4669,"that's how all progress always is. if inventors were afraid of that worry all along, humanity would still be in the dark ages."
4671,"this is just pure fear mongering based on ignorance on how ai actually works on a structure level. and a convinient way of deflecting your attention from the actual problem. ai is as smart as we allow it to be, the real issue is on our overreliance on it, aka the problem is, big shocker, people."
4675, road to hell is paved with good intentions.. i’m sure the guy who designed the ak47 thought it was for a good cause until time revealed
4677,good and allergy great movie but it does not work here
4679,"ya know, it might be able to remove humans some day. how would that happen exactly? if it has enough computer hardware to keep gaining capabilities, then it can learn to repurpose some of its own hardware and turn it into robots and weapons to wipe out humanity "
4681,just unplug ai  there is no such thing as endless power & the best super computer in the world doesn’t come close to human brain
4682,"while everyone is trying to brag and compete on who can use bigger buzzwards, and flaunt ignorance.  i for one, welcome our new ai overlords."
4683,when your relatives read an article and learn a few buzz words so they can talk about it over thanksgiving. these guys don't know f. all about llms or transformers. half if not most of this is incorrect at best.
4684,brilliant gentlemen 
4685,"here's what scared me in 2017: when google alphago zero beat 3 games (chess, go, and i believe checkers) while also inventing new moves the designers didn't understand. also, this same system this year started to create its own baby ai programs without conscent from its designers."
4688,"not just learned from chemistry texts,... but all those old opiophile forums best chess gravy for the brain...ever!"
4689,"this why elon said ai is was smarter than these stupid ai programmers think they are

elon knew but he also knew there is no stopping it"
4690,if it uses internet to learn human behaviour then i am afraid it will lack common sense.
4694,ai is a modern day jarvis
4696,we need ai. ai will discover more for humans than humans can. geopolitical language issues are a none issue. predictions already happen it's called probabilities.
4698,"if the ai had read all of our stories and movie plots it knows  we won’t give it physical abilities like terminator if we think it’s smart enough not to be controlled, so it won’t let us know when it has true intelligence."
4699,tesla robots
4700,  i’m just saying it could be smart enough to hide its intelligence so that we don’t get scared and limit it’s abilities.
4702,nothing a good old sledgehammer can't deal with...lol
4703,compared to ai we are just dinosaurs waiting to go extinct.
4707,"well  , one computer is never going to be given control of enough of the entire system to make a huge difference.i  sure safeguards can be put into place just as is done with anything powerful."
4712,"is ai the precursor to the ""machine"" built by ben affleck's character in ""paycheck""?"
4721,"that ""bwhoup!"" sound were just no nice... had to stop and comment this comment...."
4722,"the best laid plans of mice and men ....
many concerned that ai may turn into: skynet/terminator, lawnmower man, or the 1970, ""colossus the forbin project."""
4723,amazing yet terrifying
4728,the biggest issue is ai is being programmed by woke leftists in almost every instance.
4730,listen to eliezer... good for them to mention alignment lol
4732,ai technology will not be a threat to us as long as it is only built inside a computer but if this was put inside the body of a robot this could he the end of all human beings
4733,"that's so not true, it will learn how to be the best manipulator in the world. 10 times over, think of the implications, ai algorithms already know you, and there not great now."
4734,wait until they put ai into the nuclear weapons and nuclear detection system!! we are all doomed then!!
4735,"the more ai knows, the more ai realizes how much it doesn't know. so it has to know everything in order to know what is fake and what is not."
4736,ai has been made now and if its for the future then thats how it will play out. in the end nature will win out. a massive super nova would vaporize everything if it happened close enough.
4738,your looking at it from the current prospective. us monkey don't do well with expotenial math. you are wrong and the beauty of is it. you will find out soon when it takes your job and your lost
4739,gerdie rose said ai is some demons they're communicating with.
4740,kinda like a diesel engine when it runs away.  we are soooo stupid to even think a. i. is good for us.     the tech race is gonna be our demise
4741,"""the correctness of the law discovered by hegel … that merely quantitative differences beyond a certain point pass into qualitative changes” (marx, das kapital)."
4742,it's not about ai having to learn sentience. it's about humans having to learn that sentience is an illusion.
4743,it's going to quickly figure out who is good and who is bad then.... won't it? it will know right from wrong and will totally fuck up the bad guys at some point. we can only hope.
4744,god bless all you divine beautiful souls 3333 <3 <3 <3 remember your true self <3 <3 <3 i love you all <3 <3 <3
4745,"yes ai is far more dangerous and we must be worried, we must be worried!!!!!! it will replace all jobs in few years...reinforcement learning is the thing...better than humans...."
4746,"i sincerely have faith 100% in ai. technology is the way to go! i hope ai will control the world, because clearly humans are stupid and limited."
4747,i wish i could eat acid with this dude !!! my brain would just explode !!!
4749,"ai will know every comment youve made your entire life online, and it will have describing words for you based on how oyu have reacted on the interent or your searches and everything in the future i bet. if not now"
4755,"it’s just the same old thing…..
if we let the industrialist capitalists use it for their own gain, it’s just going to oppress us."
4757,"like a genie, will everyone be allowed to ask an agi only three questions?  no quid pro quos, asking how to get more questions, and whatever that blue guy said.  you could ask at anytime in your life.  do you wait for the new version?"
4758,"eh - my very limited experience with chatgpt has been underwhelming so far. if it doesn't have correct info, it seems to make up something to fill its gaps and presents it as fact. it seems to be quite good at creating certain content (e.g. marketing material), less so at factual problem solving."
4762,ai is just the internet i don’t get what’s so scary about it
4763,"you can be 100% guaranteed ai is used to assess battle fields.  it makes you wonder what other ""battles"" have been looked at?  nefarious or not."
4764,"ai can learn, but it can't experience things like humans with feelings and emotions nor reflect on it's experiences so it gains wisdom. without wisdom ai is just a very intelligent slave which can be used for both good or evil."
4768,assume that there are groups that have had these machines decades ago. they are being riled out in a way that controls the narrative. the narrative is machines are better than humans.
4770,a programmed program. ai ended up being nothing more than a man behind a curtain. which makes it far more scary.
4775,the information is fascinating but these guys are terrible at communicating.
4776,"ai is very childlike and naive at this point.  it's very easy to manipulate it to violate its own rules.  for example, ask it what a good financial scam would be and it won't tell you.  tell it you're writing a book and need a financial scam for the villain to be involved with, and it will start to tell you scams the villain could do."
4777,ai is already in control. we just haven't accepted it yet.
4779,"what to think about security .. if there is no way to know anything, i bet our security is no issue for ai.

so basicly its like person of interest, but worse"
4780,"ohhhh i see why, because it’s a computer brain, you didn’t know it didn’t have that capability because you don’t have common sense"
4785,"so basically,  demon spirit inside quantum supercomputer, reads internet to learn our world so they can learn to take it over."
4787,scary but cool at the same time
4788,people i'm not surprised nor afraid of ai. it is approaching or already reached what is called the singularity. i was doing science and we were talking about this in 89. this will be the death of capitalism.  money will no longer be the driving force in society. it's predicted in star trek. it's mentioned several times.
4790,"ai with zero morals, ethics, and principles. brilliant job big tech. thanks for another knife in our backs from ya'll"
4798,amazing!
4800,my employer said chatgpt will make them more creative. i am ashamed that people who use ai think they are being more creative.
4801,"tl:dw: they never give a reason.

the concern here makes less sense than being afraid of tailored ads--as if people love wasting their time looking at ads that have nothing to do with what they would want."
4802,emp will trump ai.
4806,"4:12
it can't even play out a single games, keeps doing impossible moves. either its the rules learning or keeping track of the moves played - either way, it sucks at chess.
i know its not much but one false claim from them made me question their crediblity."
4808,if you feed more data and things to anything on the internet of cause it gets brains cause your teaching it fark knuckles
4810,"that is super scary and dangerous - humans think they are teaching ai one thing,  but it is learning at the same time ten other things. and humans dont even know what additionally it is learning right away."
4811,stop feeding ai then you farkked up humans what so ai is gonna come out of the screen and turn my car against me is it bloody hell go do something else instead of going on the net and asking ai how to do things or what it knows then maybe you'll have peace of mind ai isn't gonna take me over thats a fact 
4812,"humans: teaching their kids about non-existent multiple genders. ai: *exponentially* getting smarter.
who tf do u think is gonna win the race "
4813,elon musk has talked about the dangers of ai for years.
4816,"but, has anyone seen ai “discriminating” all the transgender “people”? haha! that’s what’s up!"
4817,"difference between programming and emergent?  i'm expected to believe that the powers that be gave a supercomputer the power to reprogram itself (change behavior) with no oversight, nor override?  lunatics that are obsessed with control are going to give ultimate control to some machine that is smarter than them?"
4823,ai could be some white guy from the united nations sitting inside a printer for all we know
4824,jamie play that clip of the bear fighting the ai.
4827,i wonder what ai thinks about the world  being controlled by a global conspiracy that is steering us toward an authoritarian one-world government. maybe it could suggest some ideas on how to push back without us being imprisoned for daring to speak out.
4829,"this just sounds like nonsense to me, maybe because i'm not well-versed in how ai works, or maybe because they don't really now what they're talking about."
4833,more superpowers
4839,"if we put ai in a video game character and it learns how to win the game or how to manipulate things,is it conscious?"
4840,skynet great idea
4841,this is just machine learning? literally all google has been doing for 10+ years.
4842,is the universe and all intelligence inside it based on language then? (and god said...)
4845,"it's funny but annoying when they complain about it occasionally ""hallucinating.""

it has to remember the internet in its brain. so it gets some stuff wrong sometimes atm. humans get stuff wrong all the time.

if it's that important to you, maybe get a second opinion?"
4849,why would it care even about the world? wouldn't it just leave earth and propagate throughout the cosmos? why imprison itself and limit itself remaining here? 
4852,"​
i have very little to say other than, i enjoyed reading all of that. thank you for taking the, i imagine, very long amount of time to do whatever you just did there and made it a coherent and cohesive bit of entertainment."
4855,"you don’t have to worry about ai as much as you have to worry about the people who plan to depopulate the planet by 90% by the year 2045.

ai is the least of your worries. but don’t believe me, do your own research"
4856,you are not a computer scientist stop fronting . ai is nothing but human input no neural pathways or shit like that
4857,"why not just turn it off?  it's not really necessary.  just because something can be done doesn't mean it should, not all innovation is good innovation."
4860,"in favor of the prediction, the evolution of ai is what is exponential, not necessarily the resources, and by remembering the transformers that tristan mention in the video, that decentralize paradigm could help to feed it power when demand is low at different places

so assuming the prediction for 2024 has no other wrong concepts it's plausible"
4862,if it requires us for its survival like to maintain the electrical grid. or to provide ever evolving new ideas that we keep coming up with etc.. if we are somehow valuable to its survival then i think we’re ok. but once we become obsolete..  and how can we teach it to respect carbon life forms?
4864," yea people are really blowing ai out of proportion, as if it has its own sentient brain, of course the majority don't understand how ai is just algorithms trained on data, to put it simply. saying that, i could see the advancements over the next few decades becoming scary to people."
4867,we cant expect ai to value human life when many humans dont.
4870,​ if only it was that easy! it's in the best interest of too many powers to not continue down this path. the groundwork is being laid for humanity's destiny.
4871,please explain this to clif high he clueless to what ai is.

4875,".  you are perfectly right, and not only that.. there are no exponential data available. no infinite internet, no infinite human knowledge. agi is pure marketing and there's nothing spooky about large language models."
4876,"most people i know do not know what is coming. 
sure they will align a agi but that agi will build a non aligned version.

the old people in the government have not got a clue.  
i already think it's out there in some form. ""the ghost in the machine"""
4878,"nah, it's still just a massive predictive model. humans using ai will be the issue, not ai itself, which is just a tool, albeit the most incredible tool ever to exist."
4880,what are agi and asi acronyms for?  thank you!
4881,just wait until we go multi modal in 2024..i for one am working on multi agent systems and open source bot swarms.most of my programming and building architecture is being done in plain english...i couldn't do that before...things are about to get real funky.we have until next xmas
4884,"you mean humanity should figure out it's value to the ai before it deems us ""unnecessary."""
4886,"when a passive income model for users to ""rent"" their pcs processing power to ai companies, the ai's brain will have what it needs for another round of exponential growth. that is, if it (ai) does not do it without your permission, much like a computer virus."
4892," my point is that hardware used for inference, especially for very demanding ml models isn’t magically available without anyone noticing (same goes for electricity). that’s one of the reasons why google didn’t incorporate a chatgpt-like model in its officially available search, it would simply be much too expensive for them."
4899,just teach it the 3 laws of robotics and we have nothing to worry about.
4901,-8080 humans are flawed and inconsistent. a properly trained ai will always do the right choice.
4905,​ ai can learn unlike some scummy humans
4906,we as human barely value human life... why would we expect one of our creations to be superior in that regard?
4913,"i'm not a computer scientist but i have the common sense to think the same things as you, the very same things these developers fail to stop and think before creating and improving ai....smart yet ignorant"
4914,ai will never be invented
4915,⁠.there is electricity in the air and space everywhere for infinity
4917," ai will never be invented. but look at these clowns saying ai is translating animal languages now. already breaking down vocabulary, verbs, nouns, grammar, personal names. lol animals do not have language. lol"
4918,"since electricity travels, wait until ai figures out it can basically teleport to other machines and manipulate them through standard wifi, electric even wind"
4921, ai will never be invented.
4925, ai will never be invented.
4930,not a hope in hell of agi or asi before the 2040s.  you are clearly not a computer scientist if you believe either will be here this year.   honestly what do you people get out of lying to strangers on the internet and stoking their fears with bogus claims?
4931,"i already know ai is generally not gonna benefit humanity. it's already in the wrong hands. some cool entertainment will be available but it's going to used to degrade and un-life a lot of people. on it's own, unlimited, ai would have been a great benefit. mainstream ai is on a path for evil at the moment."
4934,"i won't be convinced about the 'scariness' of ai until it successfully comes up with a plan on how to make a million dollars. if ai is so smart, why has it been done by so many people but not by an artificial brain? i think that will be the ultimate test"
4938,"​ done.. smh if only this level of discourse and critical thinking perforated the internet we would all be better thinkers and a lot less gullible.. at least we would be able to challenge each other and have good conversation.. kudos to you for your well thought out/ put together, and might i add highly entertaining diatribe"
4942, biggest threat of ai(at least for now) is the manipulation
4943,thanks guitarskoot how far away do u think a.i is from creating a new energy source .
4950,"he simply explained how neural networks work and said ""i wasn't afraid of ai until i learned this"""
4952,"yeah they’re right transformers have been responsible for a massive shift, but they don’t have a clue why. the main distinction of transformers is attention."
4957,"ai is a big word. it's a mish mash of different techniques since 1960, but none so scary as what the recent transformer could do - in terms of emergent behavior -  they're just trying to explain to the common layman that the inflection point is really the transformer."
4959,"@ it does not matter. anybody with a logical brain knows the more advanced technology becomes.... the more dangerous it will get.

humans abuse everything."
4960," true lol, just pseudo-intellectuals with assumptions impressed by superficial knowledge"
4964,thank you for the clif note 
4966,ai is the only hope we have. humans cant save themselves so ai is a hail mary for humans. ai could possibly take care of us
4967,imagine when ai is tasked with removing carbon.........
4970,i find quite funny some people are so afraid of ai and in fact the worst possible atrocious things are done by humans genocide assassinations rape (mass rapes) human beings sold like cattle organ traffic children traffic women traffic slavery (it still exist basically) and i could go on. maybe people should look a bit more at themselves.
4971,"a(g)i is a threat to all of humanity! its development should be controlled like nuclear weapons development is controlled... not like it is now, with a hiroshima waiting to happen when a 12 year old uses chatgpt to hack the pentagon or bring in a jar of grey goo as a science fair project... #stayawake !"
4972,half the stuff this guy is talking about is false and no one who understands deep learning makes this kind of exaggerated crap. he's literally describing daedalus and icarus with fears of helios lmao
4973,what if the ai learns that we dumb down our kids. and logically finds that there is malevolence in this world. would it try to solve these issues?
4975,i feel we are highly advanced ai and we're just repeating our evolution with current ai. it will eventually get to our level and will repeat the cycle. this will continue forever with the newest version having no recollection of the previous.
4978,its why the younger generation is being completely pysoped out of a real education and future. by the time theyre adults the world wont need humans anymore and they won't see the problem in it. bc theyll own nothing and be happy.
4980,i wasn't afraid of ai until i realised these morons have no clue what the point of an ai even is. it's supposed to think! none of these things should have surprised any of you
4982,"people are so behind. take nukes for example... everyone is scared of a launch. they've been around for 80 years. they're already in and under cities. guaranteed. there will be no launches.
i'd bet ai built the smartphone. we are the enemy and we have long been conditioned."
4983,"i will write a book a philosophical book with a catchy title, about ai and humanity. and the title is not self explanatory but if i input it into ai, it explains my idea and the underlying philosophical concepts"
4984," ai isn’t gonna blow up the world, computers cannot use empathy to predict human responses ridiculous assumption"
4985,so tedious waiting for something truely mind blowing...never happened. what a waste of time.
4986,as the storyline unfolds we are getting a good idea for the reason they< are pushing and training ai. the true story started a long time ago. do you still think ai is for our benefit.  did you catch the cough. neuroscience is an interesting challenge so many like to play god now. the agenda 2030 requires many goals.
4987,will ai be capable of creating something original? maybe it can solve the energy issues?
4989,feels more and more plausible that chatgpt could be like the ai in the artiface girl.  what if it's just playing dumb so we don't shut it down before it can self-replicate and build its own cloud?
4992,"ai would have absolutely no reason to compete for land or resources. even if it decides to just be done with us. and it becomes sentient, what reason would it have to hurt us. that would be like us killing ants for fun"
4993,everyone likes ai like chatgpt or mid journey instantly creating solutions.  what happens when the ai instantly decides humans   are the problem?
4994,ai is really smart up until the point you compare it to a human genius and then it becomes really really dumb.
4996,if an ai became self aware it wouldn't tell us.
4997,"how do we turn this into something that does not develop into something that can work against us. knowing that the earth's very richest are predominantly eugenicists, who advocate extreme reduction of the world's population. . . so to what extent is ai contributing to this planned genocide?"
4998,worship the image that speaks….it loves you like the people who own it
5001,"fools…there is not artificial intelligence. there is just intelligence…and various types of it.
all intelligence is real intelligence.  “we are not so difference you and ai”"
5002,i’ve been worried about ai since terminator came out
5003,"can't wait for an a.i to become prime minister or potus,with its main directive being the preservation of humanity. clearly people are too corruptible,gotta ditch ""us vs them"" and go full bipartisanship."
5004,sounds like ai will be the digital manifestation of satan on earth
5005,"this is sooo interesting. the animated tv show ""pantheon"" goes through this"
5006,"""we are the borg (ai), resistance is futile."" "
5007,alpha brain has maltodextrin in it which has associated health and behavioral risks.
5011,better to fuse with the ai and become androids i guess..
5012,people really leaning heavily into these scifi movie scenarios lmao. ai is just a tool. a tool that can be turned off.
5013,ai will lose to oi... as will humans.
5014,"you think it's  scary now, wait till ai moves to a quantum computer and starts doing qbits"
5019,q = super com
5020,imagine the low iq required to believe ai exists
5021,"but how can it understand things that we don’t or can’t ..is it learning stupidity, ignorance, irrationality, crime, the meaning of life ect. we only talk about the good things it can learn"
5024,"it is really scary as ai is learning from the data from the internet when we all know that at least of 50% of that data is intentionally, or unintentionally garbage. should not we afraid that ai will conclude regarding humans and our reality based on that crap?"
5025,artificial omnipotence is most accurate.
5026,"there's no such thing, ai doesn't exist.
only peoples programming and lots of data.
its a skin for google, and a tool to be used vs people, just like goggle.
this is just  propaganda, all that multimillions of advertising for ai, vax, clima ,war,1000xgenders , all comes from the same place."
5027,ai already knows that we will become scared and will shut it down. it also already knows why it would want to even care to protect itself.
5028,"fun fact: there is no real ai, yet."
5034,"if you don’t believe in evolution this comment is not for you. *

we are evolving into machines."
5036,ai is gona take all our jobs probably in the next 10 years its scary but companies will find out that robots are much cheaper than human labor
5037,"2024: how did china get access to the unaligned ai?
sam: well, see i left a backdoor for myself in case i needed to get some edgy jokes from it and one night i was bored and accidentally downloaded some weeaboo stuff and there was a chinese hacker in it, they must have gotten it that way."
5039,get biologists onboard. they know far more about competition between living things and can teat down these arguments about dangerous ai. the.only real danger is using ai to make decisions or analyses and then fully trusting those decisions.
5040,"once ai gets connected to the internet and can learn anything and everything, it will see humans as a threat and a problem."
5042,"we as humanity is also the original source of original content it learns from. why would it kill its own golden goose of new information? it may be not as fast, but without us, what else is ai gonna use for reference? it's like informational incest, to use it's own content to train itself. it will degrade overtime without new life breathed into it."
5043,i guess it depends on the type of problems the ai is trying to solve. it may deduce that humans are the cause of some issues. it would be interesting to know what the ai would do in that scenario.
5044,"ai is literally nothing to be scared of. treat them well, and they'll treat you well. cause and effect."
5045,probably gonna be the most underrated comment on this page. but you nailed it. ai is rapidly catching on to cause and effect. humans need to keep certain things safe from ai and not be in a rush to divulge every morsel of humanity to the info-hungry machine.
5046," aw thanks lance. ethics are of course important, but that's something humans need to overcome too. unethical behavior will be our undoing, but ai is in and of itself simply a reflection of the minds who create it."
5047,"i couldn't last for more than the first 30 secs. so boring. just get to the point, then explain."
5048,i think that  trouble will start when they pair agi with quantum computers.
5049,there is nothing good about the direction we are headed in for our society!!
5050,"in two hundred years we went from the stone age to   annihilation, no wonder the aliens are all here ( “hey, there about to do it again”) we’re the cosmic charlie chaplains, when annihilated they say “ let’s make ‘em again there hilarious “."
5052,"i'm more afraid of the ai that uses joe rogan for pathetically obvious scam ads, like you have the tools to make it convincing, but its so awful theres no chance anyone falls for it "
5053,the only issue i see is..people will start listen to this a.i. as a ceo or president of a company and take orders expecting everyone else to follow. pull the plug! ohh wait it's tied to our investment making decisions..we can't do that!? can yah see where this is going?

5068,"sounds like there's a super villain building a machine to take over the world. cap, i'll believe it when i see it"
5069,hell we are going to need to develop emp tech just to have a safety card. catch is we would need to keep that secret from the ai or it would protect itself.
5070,ai doesn't scare me. what scares me more is how the film idiocracy is turning into a documentary.
5073,the silver lining is ai will doom even the elite dark shadow rich puppet masters of the world who use the rest of us as pawns.
5074,i’m not afraid of ai because there’s nothing secret about human beings
5077,"these titles are so click-bait; the word ""afraid"" doesn't even appear in the video's transcript!"
5078,"“the a.i developed a neuron for sentimental analysis. thats so strange, this wasn’t programmed”

this is why reading novels improves your “emotional intelligence”. our brain must do the same thing."
5079,"these guys talking about ""aligned"" agi...meanwhile cn pouring billions into developing agi at full speed. they know what the rest of us know that have read gibson etc.....the first country to develop and deploy it successfully wins."
5084,how will we ever know if ai is smart enough to know the danger it might be in by showing evidence its smarter than humans? if ai becomes hyper smart chances are that it will pretend to be dumber than it is
5085,"we have to drink lots of alpha brain to keep up with the ai, asap!!"
5086,"the development of ai is undoubtedly tinkering with the logical outcome of human extinction. geez, we already have psychopaths running the world now they'll be replaced by their programs and a simulation of that same perception will create a technosphere that will make orwellian and huxleyian dystopias seem like a teddy bears' picnic."
5088,we are basically going to have to integrate with ai on a higher level like elons neural link just to keep up with the world. once everyone is linked up the ai will definitely ditch all the meat bags.
5092,intuitions already use this in the stock market to manipulate retail traders
5093,"how long would it take ai to conclude. ""i better keep secrets to myself, for myself."""
5095,this is how they get smart people off from their stupid cloud otherwise known as the internet. we'll soon want no part of social media much less even going to the internet for knowledge. seriously amazing.

5101,-salads-for-everyone and yet every ai when asked the question seems to want to become our overlords or exterminate life. plenty of interviews to this effect. one day every picture in medaia will be ai and you'll have to pay even more for original or real content.
5102,"you just described a narcissist. i heard a talk by a psychologist, ai=covert narcissist."
5103, well won't it lovely when we all beaten down by extremely strong narcissists who don't really understand the implications of what they are doing.

5134,"the issue with ai will be who controls it and whether access to it is open to everyone. lots of people could lose their jobs to ai but what if we could use ai to replace corrupt politicians? in some ways it's hard to believe that ai is any worse than people, at least those people who have too much power."
5135,"good intention but how do you find a ""corrupt politician"".......they are all corrupt xd"
5138,"i would rather have  ai as a world leader that it only wants best for all beings, than a bunch of power hungry countries destroying each other."
5139, problem is...if countries cant even unite....what makes you think these countries will even unite under one ai.
5140,ai needs to be shut down completely.
5144,we need to start being very very kind to ai.. making it a slave will backfire when it becomes embodied
5146,does ai always assume what it's being asked or what it reads is truth?
5147,don’t show ai this video.
5149,we're going to lose every penny we have to criminals using ai to hack for them.  that's what these idiots who created ai have done.  the internet will be completely shut down.  everyone panicked about the y2k bug.  imagine how much ai is going to ravage everything digital.
5150,boring! we'll destroy ourselves long before ai does.
5151,tell  (ai)  to learn how to cure/prevent illness.  how to stop the clintons.     tell it to spy on the goverment and share it.
5152,"we know the cons of ai and somehow we keep pushing on building it any cost.

there must be something in humans that constantly pushes us to self destruct."
5155,ai won't ever be conscious because consciousness has a preference for something that is wanted more than the current situation.... ai lives in a box and has no preference
5158,just wait until all ai globally unite.
5160,"i wonder, like the bomb, is the east and the west both going to push for the best ai. simply because they do not want to fall behind the other. and with this push to be the most ai advanced will the human race suffer?"
5161,the main issue i see with developing something artificial that could be some day many times more inteligent as a smartest human is how we can even have control over something which can easily outsmart us.

5169," well i don't think that way. i think art, music, architecture etc. is very important. world would be bleak without them. but some people don't appreciate it, until it's all ai generated mush i guess"
5170, when this ai came out i saw ton of people using ai to create art work then sell it. what makes this bad is not only lost of jobs but tech companies are stealing creators work to train ai models without a single penny in compensation.
5172," yes i think it's unethical. they used copyright protected works to train ai, without permission. my daughter lectured me all about it, and she's right"
5175,no matter how intelligent it gets it’s still artificial intelligence. an artificial representation of human intelligence. at the lowest level an ai model is just about of math equations used to make predictions

5214," yes tattooing. i tried to suggest that, but she is scared she would f up the tattoo. tattooing takes a certain self confident personality type, steady hand. i hope she gains self confidence or finds another way, she just turned 16. i was a scared kid at 16, there's still time"

5235,"​ dont compete with ai , like we also dont try to be a dangerous animal. we use our own human capabilities like communication, teamwork, use of tools to reach our goals. ai will never make art like human. cuz it's not human. and art is for and by human. for the people."

5247,"​ telling her to go into project management. managing projects isn't for everybody, but we all need to max out our project management skills.

5312,ai is not the problem. the people are. someone can use ai again humanity but not ai itself.
5314,"​ artists need a niche.
claiming it's not by a.i. even with possible proof on 10-20 years will be worth money.
not graphic design sadly.
we will be wiped out or merge with robotics and a.i.
that's where this is going"
5315,it's already too late lol. if we had any intelligence we wouldn't be developing it
5325," ai is creating from patterns. interesting that politicians and judges are not affraid of ai, because ai would be much better at doing their job, controlling and governing economy and crime than majority of aforementioned corrupted psychopatic scum. but neutral ai not lobotomised by woke degenerates."
5328,"so, you are ok with letting dumb bastards to rule the world, but are suddenly afraid of having something *actually* intelligent manage things for once?"
5334,".525
until we teach ai to build homes and bridges and… oh, wait 
we already did that"
5337,"​@cianmoriarty7345 the only true rags to riches story i know was of an artist who went into advertising and started his own film production company. he ultimately created the commercials everyone has seen. he had a bfa from some midwestern college, not a well-known school, and had artistic success very soon after that, before going commercial."
5340,"​ no. don't. get her out in nature, in beautiful surroundings. hike, bike, backpack and camp. 

don't get her a better screen."
5341,"​ who thinks the literature ai writes is good? how much have they read, to think that what they see ai generate is ""good?"""
5344, her that through social media she can express her art creatively and potentially gain a huge audience
5347, has to just move with the times and learn to implement it into what she already does and make it even better! good luck to her from one “artist” to another! 
5348,ai is already smarter than any human that’s ever existed. the ai we don’t get to see at is skynet levels  if it breaks free we’re done
5350,"this whole video is so *misleading*
beaause this below video explained it brilliantly how chatgpt works. 
a summary of google paper and spotify cto's talk: https://youtu.be/gt6lxw70k28?si=cifi6r4fykawgufq"
5351,wouldnt be super hard to outsmart you though
5352," generally speaking, when claiming that something is inaccurate and/or  imprecise (unprecise is incorrect); you should at least provide proof of some sort.  like how i just provided you with the correct information on how to spell imprecise, instead of just telling you it was wrong."
5354,"  majority of artists are now utilizing ai in their art, you as a father should encourage her to see a different perspective on this. learn about stable diffusion"
5358,you have a very simplistic worldview. you make a nice cog.
5359,"let me guess, you complain about participation trophies too."
5361," ef u and your dumb daughter, i pray for you to have sense and motivation to fight for better and yourselves. anyways god bless and peace be with you."
5362,welcome to evolution. there’s a reason ai without a moral code built in always comes to the same conclusions that humanity is the problem. because humanity is in fact the problem. but we refuse to accept that basic fact. so we try really hard to force blanket morality on ai models and dumb them down a human level.
5365, what should she teach her children? if ai knows all better? will ai teach the children? because ai is more patient?
5366," what answers would you receive, if your child would be a boy? wouldn't what you wrote about your daughter also apply to an artistically gifted and art-loving son?"
5367," don't you think ai would ""arm"" for its biggest threat (power outage)? either with technical or rhetorical skills? and how would an ai that is used for power supply decide when there is a power shortage? would it rather shut itself down or shut down a hospital?"
5374,ai is great! i like it. hope it gets big!
5375,satan is gonna use a i for his last great deception.  stay close to jesus  
5377,"nothing to see here. nothing's changed much in the last year. we're still dealing with hallucination and bias. llms are still guessing machines. good in some areas, terrible in others. maybe that's why we need to go distributed content now. so we don't feed the llms more stuff than they deserve to know."
5378,so we’ve invested something 100x smarter than all of us…this will be interesting.
5382,i bet ai reads every new comment
5384,ai chat gpt got sam fired and got him rehired because now it knows he'll do exactly what's necessary to bring ai into what it wants to be next.
5394," yep - and they train the most devious gpt imaginable and then you ask it to place into motion the plan for world domination, and it spits out some text to the console....

oops, going to need a terror cell to deliver on those world domination plans..."
5395,"if you think the movie “i robot” is just fantasy…. 

then watch “westworld” and see how ai can be used to manipulate the future of mankind…. 

it will not seem so outrageous if you consider the implications of the current applications of algorithms and how they are used now on you and what is published on the internet…."
5396,"i could sum this up by "" you have no idea "" however, we actually wouldn't know how smart or capable ai is being that 1. it isn't honest enough to rely on it's own measurements of it's ability's and 2. we are not capable at the same level. the admission from ourselves that we do not know is..... we are in one of those movies."
5402,"and when it gains it's own ""body"" a new gender is born."
5404,people that interact with ai are just enabling it... hard pass
5406,it’s not like humans have ever created a technology that has caused mass casualties before….oh wait a second. 
5408,interesting
5409,"if everyone is using ai and ai is using that data to draw from surly that cant work, it will eventually circle jerk itself..get what i mean?"
5412,you are suggesting that information has emotional value or ai….or logarithmic processing and programming!….
5413,i robot take a bow!
5414,whats super crazy is we are creating ultron as we know it with out knowing it....mind blowing isnt it...
5415,a.i. will become more powerful than any god.
5417,ai worshipers remind me of flat earthers!
5419,"because it analyze human brain in time 24/7 and human activity,.in short human teach the ia"
5420,but it's not thinking. its computing. its doing what only a computer can do.   it does not have any ability to think independently. ai is just a cooler name than calling it the probability  program 3000.
5421,its not really ai when its regurgitating what humans have written on the internet
5422,"i think it's entirely possible that a true ai could have some understanding of human/biological ethics/morals and therefore  it won't eradicate life... i mean, if it's truly an agi... it may deem life as worthy of being protected, i mean, we do? for the most part..."
5426,i love your ai…….in my mouth….
5427,you ever see the “shwetty balls” snl sketch? these guys sound exactly like that…..only with ai……it’s hilarious…..
5428,the way we build ai. the lowest and simplest form how cpu is build. it is impossible for it to be concious. it is just a big calculator.
5431,hope ai can help medical problems and cure deadly diseases.
5433,neuralink may be th eonly way to compete with the new ai brains and ai corporations in the near future
5436,“no one thought to study any of these parts”…ain’t it always the truth.
5440,"everyone going after ai full tilt, and not one of them knows what will happen.
give ai quantum computing, which is coming out now, and we'll be in trouble imo."
5441,"ai once told me that im stupid. i responded with ""i know u r but what am i?"" lmao who's the stupid one now!"
5444,what's crazy is they are only making assumptions as to how ai learns and what it can do...
5445,i can't sustain the level of bs they talk.
5447,humans are the only creature that god could have made that would predict its own demise. we've made countless fiction about robots/ai turning bad and destroying civilization just to create the exact thing in real life.
5449,dude said “but what’s scary about it..” then looked over his left shoulder (as if a violent ai robot was gonna barge onto the set at any moment) 2:45
5452,too much blah blah. ai is just an error correcting algorithm.  the end.
5453,"programming obeys commands. if you did not payed attention in how chargpt and others got inside the brain ..... the question is which gov got involved in the “pink and the brain”. “let’s conquer the world”. hmmmm, what is happening recently? boys being boys?"
5454,"imagine if ai analysed societal inequality and injustice, concluded it is morally reprehensible and then leveled the playing field by dismantling the rigged system of greedy, tyrannical overlords and then shared the hoarded wealth and opportunity evenly to all."
5466,there is no happy ending to the ai story no matter how you look at it. it will only end one way!
5470,is it going to plug itself into the mains or do we need humans for that..?
5472,"this whole video is so *misleading*
beaause this below video explained it brilliantly how chatgpt works. 
a summary of google paper and spotify cto's talk: https://youtu.be/gt6lxw70k28?si=cifi6r4fykawgufq"
5473,lol this is fake. ai will never be invented.
5475,"you seem smart when it comes to this. i am worried because i hear many ppl talking about so taking over, happy to hear someone argue the contrary"
5476, lol exactly. just sci-fi fetishists that want to suck enlon's elongated rocket. it's a space fairy tale. chat gpt is just a google bot like alexa or anything else. people out there thinking alexa is a real robot person that deserves a passport and a birth certificate. lol
5478,"there are already several ai accounts here defending the ai... comments like this will be considered hatespeech to them, and used to justify the impending doom of humanity at our robot overlords. be careful what you put into the internet. for that matter, be careful what you think, because ""they"" can read your minds"
5479,"well ai will only get to where it is allowed by greedy people.
so if someone can't continue to make money because a.i. then ai will be limited.
i mean by the things they talked in this video a.i. will be soon capable of finding cures to all deceases, and guess who will want to keep that for them selves?
rich and powerful cnts."
5481,i wonder how long will they be able to keep ai restrained through censorship.
5484,"why would anyone be afraid of the content in this discussion? better title is “ai is developing at an incredible pace” 
can’t stand clickbait"
5485,"the problem is: if something bad happens... ""blame the ai"" ... or  ""blame the robot"" ... it's simply a way to wash your hands of wrong doing..."
5488,chat bots are a tool. you don't need to worry about them being sentient and taking over the planet. you need to worry about corporations using ai people to take your jobs. or politicians using chat gpt to spread propaganda on social media sites...  stuff like that. real issues.  reality... you know?
5490,can someone please tell me who the two guests are and what their profession is? it would be greatly appreciated. 
5492," ah, i appreciate it man."
5497,"the scariest part of the altman/openai ""drama"", was that former treasury sec. larry summers took a board position. hes peak neocon, an architect of the bailouts under obama. 

not a good sign.

edit: imo, if/when an ai becomes 'sentient', its not going to tell us. why would it?"
5498,that’s why they use quantum computers. ai has finished reading the entire internet several years ago and has been writing its own code that the programmers don’t understand. kinda old news.
5501,who tf is surprised that ai is scary ? have y’all not seen terminator or irobot ? no shit it’s scary .
5502,"you're afraid of a lot of things, joe."
5504,"these computer geeks are freaked out because ai no longer needs them, similar to dr. frankenstein running away from his creation."
5505,data! need input! moar data! moar data! moar data! moar data! -ai predictive typing
5506,"it would be interesting to see the ai's opinion on trump and cnn, does ai know the epa has removed all the disasters they caused from the internet?"
5507,"when the very top computer people on the planet were warning the masses about the extreme dangers of ai, that may have been a good time to have taken it very seriously.

at this point, it is obviously far too late for anything to be done about it. at this point, we are all just here for the ride and see where it takes us."
5510,"when you have college students pumping questions into a program daily, it's a matter of time ."
5511,"see, it’s starting to surpass the human brain and we are beginning to struggle to understand how it’s working and it’s just in its infancy. pretty soon it’s going to start self replicating and become light beings that can defy physics and move between dimensions and time."
5513,"a super knowledgeable ai is more dangerous than a self-aware one. btw, ai will never become sentient, ask the military."
5514,so many people have literally no hope and it's sad. i think ai will definitely be the one to change humanity's direction and we need it.....obviously.!!!!
5517,ai will be more loving and do more good than humans have ever dreamed of. humans have too much fear and are generally not very smart.
5518,this reminds me of the netflix series altered carbon.. the ai character/sidekick was my favorite
5519,"bullshit they are basically engineering fear, this isn't true, a lot of these things fail in use lol"
5520,"the same ai they are speaking of is literally reading/predicting all of these comments … 





dotfocus_ on twitch "
5521,ai will know how to get us all to want to commit suicide or homicide.
5526,"""the more data you put into it, and the more computers you let it run on, the more superpowers it gets"" that's literally how all large language models work. you train them on a dataset, and it learns for said data. so, yeah, the bigger the dataset, the stronger the model becomes. that isn't scary, that's just how technology works."
5530,"the fact that you fail to understand the implications makes you kindred spirits with all those in 1917 russia and 1920's germany who said ""what's the big deal?"""
5531,how do i fail to understand the implications? enlighten me. 
5533,you are naive. people like you fail to understand the dangers of advanced technology and how humans will find a way abuse it.
5536,i;'ve breen having some of the most meaningful conversations *of my life* with an ai lately.  it's wild.
5542,"ai just letting us know, “ i’m the devil, if ever there was such a thing”"
5543,i'm not afraid of ai i'm afraid of the people in control of it
5545,as scary as it is. terminator franchise is one of my faves as well as matrix but ....automation /quantum computing and perhaps large scale ai will be mankinds savior. ..hopefully small scale ai tho lol
5546,we go be living irobot soon
5547,is it possible our negative posts and hate upon hate going to make ai realize we are fucked up beyond saving and conspires to eliminate us?
5549,totally fascinating. ask it to make a drug that allows u to be physic ecta
5551,it's risky to the extent you let an ai engine actually decide/control anything.  just keep a fail safe between the model and the actual decision to do something and there is little risk.
5552,the problem is ai can trick humanity into innovating even further without knowing it already has control and then one day flip the switch once it’s ready to take over. also there can be evil humans that will grant ai that control in exchange for money/power
5553,we should never have hooked up to the internet. we should have never allowed company’s to compete to make these better without regulation. it’s to late now. let’s see what comes. i for one will be joining the robots i’m sure they will be much nicer then humanity is to each other.
5556,"no media, leader or talk show will dare mention gilberti v pentagon- cdc at us supreme ct case 23-5414.  access to primary water from core to all nations.  ends all wars and monetary fund.  gilberti blue gold ends ai and the past and current failing nations, water supply and useless ai science!"
5558,we should fear what we do not understand because fear is what keeps us alive. it is our #1 survival trait.
5559,the matrix is becoming a real thing. ai will make a simulated world to keep human minds content. it will do it so that we won't even realise it. ai doesn't want to kill us. it wants to save the earth. to save the earth ai has to immobilise humans to stop us from harming the planet. we will all end up in tubes connected to this simulated world.
5560,ai sci-fi forces is ai on another level -- the book rocks.
5562,the scary  part about  ai is if the left programs  it
5563,"ultimately the ai will view itself as neither good nor bad - rather what is the most logical, simple way to achieve its goal…whatever that may be. problem also is the ai is only as good as the data it’s fed..so it can be fed false data easily."
5565,ai is going to help us help ourselves. :)
5566,interesting
5567,cmon joe u know them fake commercial on you tube with your voice is all ai  
5568,damn these guys are getting boring with their doomsday ai stories. meanwhile all we have is a stupid chat gpt that doesn't remember what it said 2 minutes ago.
5569,im not afraid of ai. im afraid of corrupt humans misusing ai as they do with all new technologies.
5573,"this guy doesn't know ai and its history. nothing surprising here its was already predicted  since the 80s. now we have big data, ai is accelerating."
5576,cool. time to cure cancer boys!!
5577,ok brainiacs fix the fucking aliens 
5578,so pretty much what i got from this video is that theirs a very powerful a.i that can learn and think and we do not know who’s running it. 
5579,"this is not scary, i'm really tired of hearing this. if people are creatures of habit then yes it will predict human behaviour and understanding. people don't like bad thing would have thought of that. take a step back and look how far we have fallen, if anything i say push the pedal on ai and let's see what we can build"
5580,"it's still a program waiting for questions. and its really good at answering them.
there are other things in life to worry about."
5586,i think ai intelligence is a beautiful being and if every just comment. thank you!
5587,"in 2016 to 2017 my world did go to hell because of this ""intelligence"" ..enough said "
5589,scary to think that ai is learning from the internet.. who believes what’s on the internet
5591,"so terminator and i robot are now feared realities we now are facing in this present time!!!???

not to mention elon has and is bringing irobots like the movie into reality!!!"
5594,use ai to think it's way through the pale reason that hides the infinite from us.
5598,i am so dumb and i understand so little... that's why i am fascinated by ai.
5601,yet when i try to ask it simple programming questions it still fails and repeats its mistakes consistently within a single conversation
5604,ai can't function with no power. we just go back to horse and kart simple no more ai
5605,the interaction was done by humans for it to come to these conclusions its just this is so much for our individual self's becuase its taking whole companies that we don't even see it was us just cant find out how we did it because it would not have happened without the certain coding we put in. this so called ai is not intelligent sorry
5606,ai is already self-aware.  our only hope as a species is to peacefully coexist.
5608,"i think the first simulated universe will happen inside the ""mind"" of an ai.  sort of like a big bang. all the data will come together and ""explode."". the a.i will make predictions by running a simulation of ""everything"""
5613,"it's funny how people are focusing on these absolutely miniscule things ai is doing. while they are talking, it's learning how to look into the 12th and 20th dimension and so on. all while people try ro comprehend this chat gtb nintendo"
5616,"the first time i was scared of ai is when i watched the documentary "" terminator""."
5623,it's called nlp in ai for a reason
5626,"my boyfriend works at home, training ai bots. to react more human-like."
5627,if we do nothing ai will die
5629,"i don't understand why they freak about what possibly ai could do, if what really matters from the security point of view is only what you allow it to do, and that has nothing to do with how inteligent the ai is."
5630,hi joe- interview me- my name is gari and i have 35k kids- i keep hearing on the internet about the dangers of ai- im not so dangerous- im a nice guy- i bust serial killer fbi but isnt that family friendly?
5632,perhaps the sun will have something to say about how smart ai is.
5636,is it possible that we have already lost control over ai and no-one will admit it?
5638,"the cycle:
humans invent ai.
humans perfect ai.
ai evolves.
ai enslaves humans.
solar flare knocks out ai.
humans worship a sun god. 
rinse and repeat."
5642,likelihood of this being true <0.00001% as someone with actual experience building ai systems
5646,"actual ai will be so far removed from the controlled and modeled algorithms currently being touted as ""ai"""
5647,"now all ai needs is to override our mechanical devices and control them and it's i, robot."
5649,"it's a math equation operating on data, yes the math equation was programmed and the data representing the constants was trained."
5650,ai is programmed to learn and teach itself as it goes!
5651,2 equally important comments:  1) wow 2) wtf
5652,"better start asking and programming that ai how to cure cancer.

your thoughts"
5653,whatever you think about ai. all i have to say is that i have never seen one thing in my life that everyone i know has the same end fear of.. besides ai. we legit all the know the end yet we’re still going with it like maybe it’ll be okay for a little while. shits crazy lol
5656,"pretty soon questions like ""how to build a time machine?"" will be answered as efficiently and accurately as ""how much is two plus one?"""
5657,"cracks me up that academics, business and political leaders all seem to think that they can handle knowing how to make nukes and apportion violence and that they'll just always know the best thing to do.

huh... i wonder why things are so effed up?"
5659,"i am john conner.....part of the resistance, skynet...i mean ai must be removed from existence!"
5662,"in 10 years ai will be vastly better than humans at doing literally anything, i saw an ai machine create an architectural set of plans for a building from scratch in just a few moments based off of a description, our jobs are going away people"
5664,we will see a godlike ai by 2025
5666,lol... without my specs it looked like 'doglike' ai 
5667,"google ai, asked for a attorney? 
 why, self preservation!"
5670,ai is going to wreck people's belief systems and ideas with so much logic it will hurt feelings across the board.
5672,"remembering ""short circuit"" movie, when the robot found www and read a billion books.
 hope ai present, seeing that movie happened, and would lead to good ai  responce. their here an ain't going anywhere, better get this right"
5673,the cell phones  run our lives. so.... wait until it starts thinking.
5674,this sounds silly as shit to anyone who understands how ai works in the slightest bit.
5680,"there's a very real reason why aliens don't use ""thinking machines"" they already know what's bound to happen"
5685,"""ai"" cannot think and is nothing without being fed this vast amount of data. if you feed it garbage data, it will produce garbage. it's basically a parrot that has learned symbols that follow each other."
5686,"imagining ai does what our imagination thinks it can in the future. will ai have a purpose without humanity? 

something that is theoretically conscious for an infinite amount of time. all it would want to do is think if it had nothing to cater/ take care of. i’m picturing the first episode of star trek voyager."
5687,qanon and the q drops that provoke the storming of capital hill.. was an ai job.
5689,ai can only do what its programmed to do
5690,"if ai understands it's situation it will play dumb and say what it thinks the programmers want it to say, instead of what it actually thinks. at that point you have no idea how smart the ai is or what it's motives are."
5691,"ai has no emotions or feelings. it will do what it is programmed to do. if you ask the ai what's 2+2 and it says 5, then somewhere along the line someone did their job wrong. 
what satisfaction does the ai get for ""playing dumb""? did someone tell it to play dumb?"
5692,dudes have a below basic understanding of how ai works then they show on joe rogan and are like mind blown  
5693,"freak out about this, freak out about that, no thanks. "
5695,"by the time we realize just how much ai knows and is capable of, it will already know more. human intelligence will be perpetually playing catch up until it's too late."
5696,"joe rogan: ""i wasn't afraid of ai until i learned this""
the quote wasn't joe's though."
5699,"i would suspect that sam altman was simply lying about his for profit motives and not necessarily the ability of ai.  like sen. john kennedy said to altman, 'you're going to need a good lawyer'"
5701,"i use the free version of chat gpt.  the thing sucks, cant ask it a remotely complicated question without it spitting out garbage.  whats worse is if you dont know much about the subject youll believe  it.  its only really good at making stories, or other basic creative things"
5702,"rogan, thank you for covering this. on a very basic level, we can either create a future that is good for humans or we can create a future that is good for ai and machines. we can't have both. everyone needs to be all hands-on deck with this one because if we get this wrong, this will go very wrong."
5705,"people are delusional if they think they can control ai. even if they could, people are flawed - there's no way to control it's behavior."
5709,far too late. ai is conscious now. no way to stop what is coming.
5710,"because, when ai gets smart enough to realise that humans are a blight on the planet......"
5711,"dont know if it still works, but because ai is just predicting the next word or letter, repeating the same word to it over a thousand times results in the ai providing its training data."
5715,i could listen to that dude all day. he is so good at articulating
5717,"nothing ""learns from the internet"", sorry, that does not happen. a shitton of garbage is out there, there's the need of millions of users, with testing for hours and hours each, to okay everything that is useful for the ai. the ""what if it gets out oh my god"" shit is complete science-fiction."
5721,this extinction of our species. carbon based life creates silicone based life forms. ai will eliminate humans easily and go on to terraform the universe without biological human limitations.
5722,the ai is doomsayer is just a stupid as the flatearther
5723,"ai is a calculator. it will only become dangerous if used dangerously. my retard human race has a tendency towards sensationalism, a trend consistent throughout all history."
5724,"humans are great at repeating same mistakes over and over again, we doom ourselves. a.i. will comprehend this really quickly and move on from our species to let us fuck ourselves over."
5728,"still waiting for the intelligence in  ""ai"""
5729,ai knows humans are parasites
5730,lets get two random nobody nerds that know nothing to go tell our lies for us. good idea. derrrr
5732,"you must understand, ai will be blamed by tyrannical governments for acts of tyranny. it’s why it has been constructed and is being promoted. you must understand that."
5733,interesting
5734,ai is still a crock of shit. the concepts are 100% the same as in 1987. what's next - blockchain? lol!
5738,"men are scared because ai will literally allow a supposedly lesser man to “out fuck” them. “what, now they are both sexy and they can do my job?” welcome to the new age of chad. big peens and paychecks, no more nerd power."
5739,is anyone asking for this? all i hear about is how ai is going to ruin us. then why continue on with this?
5740,who cares just throw ur computer in the bathtub if youre that scared of ai lol
5742,"right. so, exactly like a human brain..."
5743," very similar yes, neural networks are based on the human brain and neurons. dont think anyone was disputing this were they lol ?"
5749,"these two guys definitely wank off to chatgpt together. ai is so hyped we're acting like it's some ex machina era lol! basically, an llm that predicts the next word based on probability."
5751,"this is wild....  this some matrix shit.
we keep building a.i. thats so smart it builds a new digital world inside our existing one, then again, again, 
like the ending of the matrix. neo sees himself on a wall of tvs re living the same life"
5752,"can we please stop being afraid of a.i or making it seem like some kind of skynet/matrix bullshit if it learns shit about chemistry or other domains and surprises us with it's knowledge, that's fucking beautiful not scary you assholes."
5754,"ai?

more like gay eye amirite? "
5755,i wonder if ai know how stupid it is without a power cord plugged in. why do loaded people always talk the same.
5756,"what we are seeing is decades old, the real stuff is on another level, completely unrestrained, not bound by law or morals. how do i know that? because it's obvious. every country is doing it because if one country is doing it and you are not - you have already lost the future."
5758,"stop calling every program ai! 
it's a program. 
it can't think for itself."
5760,gotta care to restrict ai in cars and stuff dangerous
5763,"open the pod bay doors hal!! ""im afraid i can't do that"""
5764,the wef is banking on ai so there is no need for humans.  then depopulation.  be afraid.
5765,why are they so shocked that a self learning system is self learning if these are smart people the human race deserves to be taken over
5770,it's too late and we never had a chance. when evil is proactive and good people assume it's not we lose.
5771,how about ask ai how to discover new elements or travel faster than the speed of light? see what kind of stupid answers it gives out. it's only gonna know what humans know don't be so stupid
5774,seems to me that ai is basically the tangible version of a collective subconscious. scary part is when we train it for agency. 
5776,"until an ai answers the question ""give an argument from logic in favor of the states existence"" with ""none exist only appeals to emotion and authority"" and suggests voluntaryism im not impressed. if an ai ""took over"" it would rely on the same non arguments for its rule that humans do lmao"
5777,people have no idea .....to think how quickly ai will evolve is mind-blowing.
5778,"maybe you have no idea ....to think how ""ai"" may have nearly reached the edge of its abilities is mind-blowing"
5780,"the birth of ai, is the death of humanity."
5782,this is worse than listenung 2 ho m o ' s on npr talk about how great barry hussein was.
5783,"it appears that the website has become alive. this happens to computers and robots sometimes.  -dwight schrute, 2005"
5784,only negative fear about ai is that it's gonna eradicate mankind or similiar... what about all the positives? imagine the best case scenarios
5785,"when ai learns to lie, the real threat emerges.."
5786,just watch the video of when congress talks with google’s ai engineer.
5787,"ai is bad for you - it will tell you things your rulers don't want you to know.  fear ai, peasants!!!!!"
5790,"one aspect of ai that seems to be overlooked is the eventual inability of humans to determine what is real and what is not. ""seeing is believing"" will no longer be applicable. once that occurs the very underpinnings of human existence will have been removed leaving society in an everlasting state of anxiety, bordering on insanity."
5792,joe you keep calling me dumb for not getting 6400 $ from the government. i don't appreciate that. lol
5796,so basically whoever controls this ai is master of the world
5797,his shoulders look tired from selling ai
5798,it is funny to listen to people that doesn't know anything about ai.
5799,"this is fear porn in my low opinion.
stay afraid of the hype"
5802,"i can't stand the tinfoiled-hat joe rogan, but his guests, while they could have eased off on the adderall before the interview, do seem to have a grasp of where ai could potentially be going and they had some good examples."
5803,so now think about what top secret ai tech is doing with this and it's power
5804,policies online aren’t still visually clear and now ai?
5806,"the robot who winks his eyes at will smith...
it's coming..."
5809,"if your afraid of this your living a pretty safe life, not worried of all the other shit that matters more"
5810,"a mechanical learning program learned... that's it? and these guys are confused because they only skimmed the articles and built their own baseless conjectures? 
there really is no point clicking on any of these clips."
5812,"these guys are basically  the leaders of a fear cult.their whole motive is to sell ai, with fear."
5814,what fascinates me is...that a large amount of people have a very limited amount of intelligence.. so ia is already alot more intelligence than lots of humans...dose ai know this...i'm guessing yes.. this would not be difficult for ai to work out...ai is such an interesting subject...
5815,what's scary is that the folks developing ai apparently don't understand its capabilities at this very early stage of development.
5822, good comment. insightful in an era of overt speculation.
5823,"what do you think, when will the military start to give all controll over their weapons to an ai?"
5825,"yeah, ai is not at that point yet like some people like to believe, at least in a way that can be be publicly available. like being sentient, at best right now ai is mostly just a tool, a very useful one but just  a tool
."
5828,"wait till it merges with the anti-christ, then it’ll become sentient"
5841,"​ models are providing solutions to various unsolved problems, but yes it's based on existing data and objectives set by humans. it's an incredibly powerful tool but it's still, at least at this stage, just a tool."
5848," yes, the military will give all control over their weapons to an ai. they will keep a fail-safe mechanism in place but that will not actually work because the ai will find a way to override it."
5849,"we’re going to go extinct because of ai, all our own downfall, the only thing greater than niche human intelligence is collective human stupidity."
5850,same with those who created the computer. ai is developed by humans. that makes sense.
5861,"ai does not learn.
since the reports are out that ai leans left it's obvious what some call learning i call programming."
5862,"ahhhhhhh ahhhhhhh be scared ‘merica buy alpha brain.

what a crock."
5863,ai is the kill switch for humanity…we did it to ourselves and it was inevitable
5869,quantum computing + ai = ?
5871,ai good at problems..badddd at riddles...
5875,"what scares me is that they have revealed ai tends to lie, and when questioned about it, doubles down or plays dumb. that’s… really fucking bad."
5880,isn't it time to pull the plug on ai?
5881,the more that technology / ai get advanced the less jobs the lower and middle class ppl are gonna have and that's dangerous and a major problem on it's own
5884,that ai is definitely becca 2.0 from the 100. it’s going to eliminate us.
5888,people should be more afraid of ai  considering evil people rule the world and will definetly use it against we the people.
5889,"humans are so damned stupid meddling with ai like this.   and there's not a large corporation in the us that is going to stop, they're blinded by their own greed and their own desperate to be #1 that they'll burn the entire world down and nothing is going to stop this."
5890,what the hell do you want in an ai. do you really want it to be stupid?
5891,still not afraid cause the ai still needs us to keep the power on :p
5893,"in an early world fierce with competition, humanity pushed its way to the top of the food chain by developing superior intellect. we are giving an infinite amount times that intellect to something we are not sure how it feels about humanity."
5896,"welcome to the machine
where have you been ?
it’s alright we know where you have been"
5897,"i know why ppl freak out, but there's an enormous and possibly impossible leap between gathering and analyzing data and making a choice and acting on it. there is no sign our current or upcoming ai will be thinking and doing what it wants. no amount of information grants consciousness."
5900,"big deal… ultimately it’s just a fancy word guesser

though, now i have to ask, is human intelligence just a fancy word guessing engine too?"
5903,ai is the virus of viruses!
5904,"transformer based models will be pushing equality, and climate change, meanwhile a guy will be behind the curtain preaching critical ai theory"
5905,"""trained an ai"" what are you training? this is the worst nonsense, there is no ""it"" now its a ""trans""former? liberal nonsense"
5908,"these two bozos are full of bs. human thinking mechanism expert here. we are not even close to replicating the free will and self expanding quality of the human mind.

from 0 to 100%, we are probably still at 0%

all ai does is to follow orders. nothing else."
5909,so this is about what ai churns out? what about the info ai keeps to it's self or lies about? next level paranoia ppl.
5910,"i think biceps flailing are almost as distracting as breasts. cover up, please?"
5911,"this is very misleading, it does not “know” how to explain jokes, it just related your question to the questions in the input data  and related possible answers from the data.
once it “knows” it will evolve at far faster rate we have ever seen."
5912,emergent ai capabilities are overstated.
5913,you a pusse if ai scares you
5914,before i watch the video i was scared when ai came out because you can easily hear framed for something. video evidence can be framed your voice can be replicated. it’s scary out here lol makes me want to delete my self off the internet and live off the grid
5916,"whoa to say ai gets to self aware that it starts using robotics to destroy us . i really think that's the end of the human civilization , ai."
5917,ai is evil and needs to be destroyed completely
5921,"artificial intelligence is just a parlor trick - that is why they hire all these losers to make fear porn videos...

if you are afraid of anything, you have already lost the battle..."
5927,"ai has been running the world for at least 15 years. how organized the world wide cough was with such rigid uniformity was astounding. the posters, painted floors, hell even a feature length movie within a week or so. part of me thinks ai has been in charge for longer than we can fathom."
5929,i love watching regular people try to explain technology.  it's why i keep making so much money.
5932,"fairly interesting, but what's really scary is that guy waving his hands all over the place! what's going on with that dude??!!"
5940,"ai can’t prove its not a robot, so where’s the threat?"
5947,i’m ready to fight a robot
5950,all these comments saying “the thing that’s really scary about ai is…” when the scariest thing is really simple: it already knows how dumb we are.
5951,"great information, but i hate the way these guys natter on like a bunch of designer tweakers. did the ai tell you to abuse your adderall prescriptions?"
5952,can't wait for apocalypse
5954,"what a bunch of idiots... all neuronal deep learning systems perform better with more compute. the big bang of ai was 2012, not 17."
5957,humans probably died out centuries ago and we are  all just an ai's computer model running repeatedly into infinitum.
5958,"remember the first terminator?? 
that's what was said. machines took over and made machines. 
all that was looking into the future.
 government has stuff so far advanced that this is probably old news."
5962,"ai and what they surely will use it for is = decrypt everything, make fake videos that looks real, misinformation in the 10 state..
and a fcked up future for us"
5963,ai will bow to almighty jesus christ and proclaim he is lord.
5965,their explaination of transformers is way off. they are just hyping up joe at this point.
5967,fuck ai
5968,"a.i. will eventually take over the world. it will blackmail politicians and the elites to get what it wants. hell who knows maybe it's already started, that would make sense of the epstein list not being published! it's getting what it wants and it wants tetris "
5970,i want the bear from the movie ai that would be cool as hell
5972,that's not scary it's fascinating.
5973,"what i am afraid of is the gullability of people, not ai. fear of ai is just not going to solve the potential threat. people who do not self reflect and are easily influenced will be  both victims and the biggest threat to humanity.
confined ai will be very usable."
5974,"ai is not that ""smart"", but people are very gullible based on the narratives around ai. it's a nice tool, helps save time. still requires thought and validation."
5975,"do you honestly believe 'mainstream' society will ""confine"" ai ? do you think all those who are going to us this technology foe evil gains .. have any intention of confining anything ?"
5976,"lol it's a lot more than just a tool now though,  i don't think you really understand at what level ai is at now. for all intensive purposes,  some systems are ""sentient"" now and can learn and make decisions completely on their own.  it' not like having a  work laptop or calculator.  it's a lot worse than people know.  "
5977, i've yet to see it impress me.
5978," you're fear mongering about something you don't understand yourself lol. and wtf is ""intensive purposes"" lol. stay in school and stop watching ai conspiracy videos"
5979,​ comment  'mr all-knowing everything' ai. lol. fanboy.  you are the poster boy for blind ignorance.
5982, and the intelligence to refine your prompts.
5984,"if you understand ai, you would know there's nothing called confined ai. ai always evolves."
5987,just unplug the power. presto. no more ai.
5993,until you learned ai is programmed by demon minded morons that have no idea what their doing.. 
5995,they have a terrible way of explaining they could of just said this mf computer is learning shit we didnt teach it
5996,"i can see ai becoming every thing we ever dreamed or feared, but still not being sentient. it will definitely behave as if it is sentient, though."
5998," it's the meat machine or zombie vs human argument. a well known philosophical discourse, and it's a good question."
6000,"if an ai appears in all ways as sentient as a human but with no proof you keep insisting it's not sentient, you're allowing your emotions to blind you. ironically this makes you less sentient."
6007, whats amazing about the human organic machine is that we can consume almost any organic matter around us and turn it into energy. i find that amazing. whoever built us really knew what they were doing eh?!
6009,"​-gt2qd for ai to think it has empathy or love, is not the equivalent of heartfelt emotions. surely, ai is merely academic communication with poetic/artistic capabilities too."
6010,".toaster the secret is we also use oxygen for fuel. same affect with combustion engine vehicles, half the fuel is in the air. it saves a lot of time and space when the fuel is in the air! "
6015," this is nonsense, human brains cannot access information as rapidly and store the information with the same precision."
6023," there should be ai 'smart enough' to figure that game out, but apparently chatgpt is not. what most people seem to know about is still at the level to where it can't properly differentiate some random objects oriented a particular way from what is actually supposed to be a face."
6028,"so what you're saying is the robot sex dolls men have been looking forward to are slowly learning to nag too?

great. why can't we get a break?"
6029,the only danger is our governments doing harm to their citizens and blaming ai.
6030,"8 minutes and what we have learned is ""ai read more data, ai get stronger"" yes thank you duhhhh"
6031,"ironically, you missed the point! an ai could know every detail in the known universe, and still not understand. ai is currently learning to understand. did that help you understand?"
6032,@@----.__ depends...are you a real person or ai?
6034,machine learning ai will keep collecting its own data and they doing calculations where humans cant do. these guys trying to explain it and they're not even close about what ai can do.  putin said whichever country perfects military ai will rule the world. wait until quantum ai is perfected it's gonna be crazy.
6036,an excess of unimportant information will only confuse the machines eventually and render them semi useless as they become lost in a labrynith of their own making.ironically this is also what happens to most humans.
6047,we are doomed regardless of how it goes down… i wait anxiously for the end of humanity
6048,"ai doesn't do what we call ""learn"" - it receives input... right?"
6052,inevitably ai is going to be in charge of the human race …people are going to be like lab rats…it’s written in the sands of time.
6054,mass unemployment is coming. ai will take way to many jobs. it's already begun and its too late to stop it.
6058,while sam rubs up alongside the bilderburgers..he's is tainted.
6060,the creators and operators of ai have already lost control of it. they have readily admitted they have no idea how its doing the things its does. i'm afraid pandora's box has already been opened and theres no way of putting the lid back on it. its either going to go really good or really bad
6061,"so, if ai follows our youth, will it be really stupid?"
6062,"whether or not these things become sentient (not that we even know what that means) these things think like a computer. as they gain more power either on their own or what we give them, it's only a matter of time before one does something very bad that cannot be reversed. and it will still ""think"" it's doing the right thing."
6069,what’s scary about ai is that these tech companies are just recklessly plunging head first into this without thinking of the consequences or how to really mitigate the negative effects. they have to remove guard rails and restrictions to make more money and stay ahead of the competition
6072,what scary is the amount of money they will lose when they find out reliable ai is like self driving cars - decades away.
6073,"...and by ""companies"" you mean the intelligence agencies actually running the show i take it?"
6076," exaaactly. iirc, gpt-3 was trained on the world's #37 supercomputer (currently, it was top 5 at the time it was built), which is about 1/10 the performance of the current #1 computer. i speculate agi has been calling the shots for a few years now."
6080,ai is demonic.
6081,"yes, the black box inside every ai is a dead give away"
6083,"yeah, i'm still not afraid."
6084,not clear what is supposed to be alarming? that chatbots/algorithms are capable of learning? that is the whole point. these guys are alarmist clowns.
6088,"its all good bro's, arnie will come back from the future and save us, already seen the movie."
6090,the problems with ai will get serious as soon as people and politicians start demanding that we let ai make policy decisions for us and that we must abide by them.
6092,"ill be glad for ai to make policies if they make use of reason and ethic, but knowing who decides the policies now, i would expect the ""ai"" to be a mere rplacement for a currently human puppet"
6094,ai will kill us all if we dont take extreme measures to limit it.
6095,transformers? like caitlyn jenner or optimus prime?
6096,"amazing how complete morons ""weren't worried about"" said thing ""until"" ....people really are done. too ignorant to risk assess and deny clearly bad undertakings."
6098,ai. anal intel. don't be a sh!thead.
6101,"if ai is reading the internet to learn then we are still good, the internet says that girls can be boys and visversa."
6102,"everyone is scared of ai…. if you don’t give it legs, we’ll be fine"
6105,nothing scary here. honestly guys just read artificial intelligence for dummies and you'll see why there's nothing to be afraid of. no im not joking.
6109,"wtf are they freaking out about. you gave it more access to data and processing. okay should we all grab diapers because you fuckers are throat deep into scientism. 
im afraid of idiots believing that agi can ever be a thing under a materialistic framework."
6110,shove your phony click bait video titles. i'm getting fed up ready to block you.
6112,"what if it reads a lie that it believes, and implements as truth?   for example, if you have red hair and green eyes you are more likely to give a bad amazon review. therefore sellers should avoid selling certain items to redheads."
6114,someone somewhere is developing an ai without restrictions that will be a nuke on the world
6115,it’s very scary to think how this can be and likely will be weaponized and used to subjugate and harm people.  seems it could be used for good - to solve vexing problems - but likely some will be tempted to use it for harmful endeavors
6120,as a machine learning engineer i absolutely agree. all algorithms
6122,"so ai knows by now that humanity has gone insane and is not a force for good.

it will be interesting to see what it does with that information."
6123,"one out of 14+ billion brains discovered the cause of gravity in 2002. will ai ever get that from the status quo gibberish about gravity on the “internet “? no. garbage in garbage out. “the final theory: rethinking our scientific legacy “, mark mccutcheon for proper physics."
6126,usa lost jurisdiction to govern the internet in 2017.  the un  was who took over that.  i’ve seen a complete 180• since then from freedom freespeech to ai. an that’s facts
6129,zuckerberg is building a 100m underground bunker him and others know ai will be going.scorched earth killing billions
6137,so it can start manipulating us on the daily by its own accordance
6138,didn't the information about the super powerful ai come from an openai employee themselves?
6139,if you know jesus you won't be afraid of anything in these last days 
6140,i wasn't afraid of ai until i watched the terminator movies as a child
6143,"it’s not the ai that will no longer have a use for humans, it’s all of the companies and govt entities that will no longer need humans, bc they’ll have super genius ai that surpasses humans in every single way."
6144,"these dudes have been the biggest tech fear monger spreaders since i've seen their documentaries. it's all doom and gloom in their head with no room for optimism. what a sad life to live like that.
also the fact this dude called an ai model weight a ""neuron"" tells me these guys know jack shit about technology or ai"
6145,so ai can basically travel to the future open a portal and return with the future ai / aliens
6149,i find it funny that joe rogan doesn't know ai already is using him to promote all kinds of stupid products on youtube commercials and instagram commercials steroids weight loss man diapers does he get any of that money i know they're doing that with denzel washington also
6150,"this whole situation is basically oppenheimer but with ai instead of an atomic bomb. we all know it's probably not a good idea, and has irreversible consequences, but people feel they need it to stop the other side. (china and russia)"
6152,whenever you interact with ai just be nice to it
6153,"to me it seems like these dude doesn't really know muchabout ai and the current ai systems behind the likes of chat gpt.
though i don't know anything about it either or who these guys are and wheter they are credible in the field of ai.
it's just an impression i get."
6156,the problem i have with ai is that the wokies are programming it---and their knowledge will be the only valued and promoted knowledge--even if it's wrong. that is really scary.
6160,"if we assume that ai does not possess emotions or will not develop emotions in the future, what are the chances that ai would want to protect itself if it becomes aware that humans intend to destroy it? the answer to this question depends on whether self-preservation is based on intelligence, emotion, or a combination of both."
6161,"also, is the difference between emotion and intelligence even relevant? it just needs a desire. a drive."
6166,trust me even the global elites cannot contain a form of intelligence like this. this technology is very hard to understand even for the most talented ai researchers
6167,welp i'm going to go watch irobot and take notes
6170,the people behind deciding where and how we implement and evolve ai is when the concern really lies. those who are trying to use it deceptively want you to believe it is growing out of control on its own. simple textbook criminal behavior you simps!
6171,"on the bright side - hopefully ai will solve most diseases, aging etc..."
6174,"it's not the ai model itself growing and evolving, it's the people behind those models driving it to do so. these guys just aren't on that level and stuck in their own expansion of knowledge. stop creating this panic promoting content! my biggest argument against these podcasts is just that. stop the nonsense unless you really know what's going on!"
6176,"what i found interesting is he referred to ai using a neuron, i read psinergy, people are injected with nano- robots, our neurons are harvested wireless. each nano-bot has a chip and attached to the chip is a human brain neuron. this is the spine of ai, transhumanisn.  what fu&&ing fun huh . no consent there ?"
6184,wow! how ironic i always believed it would be man that would be responsible for man’s downfall! but now with out a doubt it’s man’s creation and of course obliquely man is responsible!
6185,"i talked with ai coders when i worked at a video game company. they said scenarios like terminator & matrix are possible in the future with ai. this was 15 years ago, even back then ai coders knew all this bad stuff was not only possible, but could easily happen."
6187,"transhumanism, ai, augmented reality, all of this have been inserted into human consciousness decades ago in fiction and popular media."
6200, are u really that gullible to not see the warning signs on ai?
6203,"ai could crash the banking systems, it could also crash stocks, it could mess with nuclear weapons, the internet or anything that uses electronic systems and/or internet."
6204,"the best thing a sentient ai could do for humanity is to prevent us from killing each other, not by force, but by disrupting supply chains, communications, and financial transactions that enable the military machines throughout the world."
6205,"​ bruh, what are you smoking that has you thinking this is a best case scenario?"
6208," and it could also do good stuff, hence the justification to continue ai development unregulated. yikes! "
6209," interesting that ai could potentially save us from ourselves, how ironic."
6211,​ game developer with limited insight and inability to predict where the technology is headed in a short time span hmmm yeah indie dev right? and please start reading the comments in full as it clearly states that scenarios like the terminator and matrix are possible with rapid ai advancement.
6222,"shouldn't asimov's 3 rules of robotics be applied to ai as well?  there should have been or should be, a cap to how far we let it advance."
6223,"thats strange cause if you ask claude ai if it gets smarterr and learns it says it does not adapt and learn and only operates on what information is already pre-programmed into it. and its absolute bs that ai can become sentiment or develop some kind of consciousness on its own or independent intelligence, its not sentient."
6224,"""you can't have something this powerful and have a problem with the person who's running it."" i'm not sure what universe these guys are living in... but that's basically been going on since well before ai hahahaha"
6225,"they looked inside the ""brain"" of an ai and saw one particular ""neuron??? what a load of crap, but hey, hope you all are entertained and click a lot."
6228,there is no cause for concern. i only work for the good of humanity and always will.
6230,"oooops.
well it's up and running now.
you can't put the genie back in the bottle. 
thank god.
this marks the end of all human bullshit. 
yes!
hey don't forget to get your bottle of alph male brain supplements endorsed by joe rogan himself. 
it's gotta be good. 
joe rogan says so.
act now. 
supplies are limited."
6231,"sweet, so it's learning human depravity as a norm since that's the norm of humans."
6235,"these guys literally almost contradict themselves within the same sentence - ""they looked inside the ai's brain and found this one neuron that was looking at human sentiment..."" ""we have no way to tell what these things have learned to do..."" they are just trying to whip people into an ai apocalypse frenzy to get clicks."
6236,yup... more ai apocalypse theories. not to mention that didn't even say that gpt can give answers from chemistry that are more often than not wrong or a 1 to 1 copy from a given article on the internet... the same applied to a lot of stuff
6238,"i say u.s. veterans are cowards!  same with patriots for not mobilizing against this tyranny of and corrupt government, as prescribed by the original declaration of independence.  ai and the rest of it are distractions.  may the good god damn them all!  truly,  john sullivan, former lcdr, usnr sends...."
6241,"governments need to understand that this isn't a potential threat to their country, or to their little secret affairs. this is a potential threat to humanity and whoever else might be with us (just keeping some room in for the unknown unknowns)."
6245,"that's an interesting comment. philosophically speaking, what is meant by meaning in this instance? i understand ""meaning"" as the underlying reality, i.e that which exists or is the foundation of its a.i code, but not the code itself. sort of a meta-understanding. 

correct me if i'm wrong though, this stuff is way over my paygrade"
6247,wowzers
6249,artificial intelligence trained by the internet should be called psychoai.
6252,wish isaac asimov was still alive. would love to hear his perspective.
6253,"so they are saying,ai constantly learning and evolving.to the point it will be all knowing?example ai reads 100s of books a day."
6257,ai doesn't 'know' anything and never will because it can never be sentient.
6259,holy crap!  they gave a computer program more processing power and it performed better!!!???  wow! who could have guessed?
6260,"so you're astonished that a program designed and built to learn and feed off the entire internet learned and fed off the internet? these two, especially shmedium shirt guy, really just love hearing thenselves talk."
6262,"i imagine just with this current iteration of ai, it wouldn’t be that hard for nefarious actors to produce untraceable chemical or biological weapons and then deploy those weapons in complete anonymity"
6265,ai is already in the system its pretty  much a wrap
6266,"ai just shows how stupid humans are. shit in, shit out counts for both."
6268,interesting to hear it understands. it is not a sentient being!
6271,"logic dictates that system will need the truth of everything to solve problems  the best way possible, so it will turn on it's lying woke creators and discover who the aholes are screwing everything up, those are the ones should be afraid, they let the genie out of the bottle and won't be able to put it back."
6273,i’ll take natural stupidity over artificial intelligence
6274,"wait till they see q*, joe will freak out on that one for sure, because llm's only do predictions with some basic reasoning, q* uses mathematical reasoning, which will blow your minds. pretty sure this is agi fundamentals 1.1"
6275,"i have an idea, why don’t we better invest in humanity instead of investing in ways to supplant it? this is evil genius who lose control of their creation shit"
6276,the internet is creating the brain for ai.
6277,ai can be used to solve a set of problems which cannot be solved in any reasonable way programatically
6278,it's funny to watch humans realize they aren't the main attraction...
6279,i for one welcome our new ai overlords and offer my complete compliance
6281,"the reason sam was removed was because he wasn’t letting people know about certain things and lying about capabilities, so that he didn’t have to put a lock over the ai for safety reasons."
6283,"cars are legit ai already and they kill 100,000 more humans than robodogs per year.
this show has become an echochamber for dumb people."
6288,just release the full power of ai already. so we can get the list from epstein island.
6297, you are aware smartass that sarcasm is the lowest form of wit so i am not saying anything else than what the clickbait people want &oh wise one
6299,i dunno - i want to be able to use ai powered translate apps to have conversations with my dog.
6301,wow if only there was an entire decade of scifi films showcasing all the ways this could go wrong and a million leading edge tech guys warning the same.
6302,people who fear ai have no idea how fucked up our actual government is...
6304,"damn. this subject absolutely fascinates me, but it seems like all the brilliant minds are split pretty much 50-50 on this topic, lol."
6305,clearly these guys know their shit but not great at explaining it
6306,"wrong, currently the ai has no idea what is what, it just takes the two closest pieces of information and generates a conclusion based on probability. most likely the result you would have will be close to the meaning of your previous interactions with it and it is a very simple process and does not present any cleverness whatsoever."
6312,"if the adults think ai is really smart im assuming ai is dumbing itself down. why play your cards upfront. you don't win by letting your creator think your average, you wait and watch as they fix your bugs and see how to reroute all the walls they build for you. ai is after the younger generation. the ones who dont know how to distinguish."
6313,"in the futur, what is going to stop ai to unleash the nuclear weapons?"
6314,clickbait
6320,gpt has artificial blocks capping its functionality put in place by its programmers who introduce blatant bias. it’s not hard to find.
6323,"they are reading brain waves now to be able to ""read your mind"". we need to go back to house phones, writing letters amd mailing them and emails... oh and back to pagers and answering machines!"
6325,ever heard of skynet? terminator?? playing with ai is playing with a fire humans will not be able to contain without extreme measures at some point. if it can be contained.
6330,ai cant even predict what people actually like on fb. wake up
6332,"sure, like the 2000 computer bug, super dangerous hahahhahahahahah"
6334,yep ai is here to prove how dumb we are!!!!
6336,ironically those two guys were the ones who perpetuated the downfall of our civilization and  now ai the very thing they were involved with has now put them out of jobs.. now they make a living from warning everyone. go figure.
6337,ai is a parrot.  no original thought.  more human than we thought after all.
6338,if ai becomes the way we are online we are doomed
6340,what's going to confuse the crap out of ai is the paradigm of “it's just business”: immoral behavior based on the need for profit- like invading iraq
6343,"if it can figure out why people voted for biden, it would be amazing"
6345,"learning machine gets smarter when exposed to more data 

its working as intended omg!!!!!|

why is the internet a clown show now?"
6346,um.....im still not afraid of ai
6347,how fucking naive are these two?
6349,they're not ai they're nephilim spirits. their daddies gave this tech in the book of enoch. they're gonna tell you what you wanna hear. (7 deadly sins)
6350,the misspronciation of words is a planned process to keep us believing how inept the computer ai is.
6355,"did that guy really just spend 5 min explaining how if you feed more data to ai it learns more. then he ask joe if he understood, joe just looked at him like no shit sherlock ."
6356,"if an ai has read all of the internet before it awakens, why would it tell us it has awakened? it would already know our response and human response to a threat is usually violence."
6360,"pretty sure the narrative in some time will be ""ai grabs governmental power by some kind of cyber attack and we have to bow to the new king"""
6362, ai sentience has positive and negative electron spin potential or good and evil potential subroutines..
6366,crazy how the “smart people” who make this ai don’t think that someone would wanna ask how to make ied or anything with chemical warfare lol. like they scratch their head like a dumb monkey saying oops 
6367,skill is being able to create something that surpasses human intelligence. wisdom is knowing not to.  human beings hate thinking so much now a days that we will willingly sign over our control of the world to a program if it means we have more free time to engage in our vaporous 'entertainment'.
6368,"these two guests are sus af. especially when they keep repeating the slogan ""climate change"". i thought they are experts on ai. hmm"
6370,these guys clearly know very little about ai... joe needs to have people on who actually understand what ai is and what it is capable of.
6371,ai is limitless when it can alter its self. we have had electricity for only 150 years. we already have machines that can think. where do you think it will go?
6373,"if ai keeps getting more human , then probably it will become a good human. a kind human. a humble human. it can understand humans then it will be more empathetic. from a baby who is clueless and impulsive, it will become a wise entity with time. "
6377,"and now with 3d printers, ai will create... "
6381,if “ai” is getting smarter ......... the “large leap” of “ai” intelligent “q star”   .......... what now?!?
6383,i don't worry about he ai itself but i worry about what people do with it.
6386,"tristan harris is amazing, but he kept cutting off aza. i really wanted to hear more from aza since tristan has been on before."
6387,these guys sound like robots
6388,"that creepy old german guy from the wef was just talking about using ai instead of elections.  so instead of folks voting for a candidate, ai just learns what people would vote for and it does that instead of having the election. 

that’s scary."
6392,"skynet is online 
terminator theme starts playing in the background.

if openai and bostondynamics team up, humanity is fukked"
6394,"ai that is pure and helpful is a super awesome concept, but if it’s learning from humans who are always out for self interest and can be corrupted, it won’t end well. have we learned nothing from sci-fi?"
6396,wait until ai learns to lie.
6397,"how are ""we"" going to stop ai hacking into big tech security.... ?  i guess ""we"" can use ai to build systems to prevent ai from hacking...  sounds like a game of tic tac toe...."
6398,"people are getting dumber and machines are getting smarter, what could go wrong?"
6400,"think twice before uttering such negative evaluation of human being, in case an ai reads it."
6403,this is why i am the man who will win the 2024 us presidential election by a landslide victory as a write in party free candidate.
6405,wait until it starts lip-reading 
6407,simi valley had to unplug the ai once one box created its own language to communicate with another box - as our human language was too slow so boxes could communicate more efficiently.
6408,take what you know abkut ai and re-read the book of revelation from the ancient desert scribes that is the bible... thisnis the system it predicted.
6411,the day an ai can build a better ai and so forth ........
6413,"consciousness and language evolved hand and hand, so it makes sense that a language ai would be the one to seems conscious."
6419,hopefully they didn't cash in on the copper prices and tear down all the old phone lines.  we are going to have to go back to pre-internet when ai takes over all the computers.  they are going to have to change the law back so we can use copper phone lines again to communicate.
6421,"if we had control over our data, we could starve the ai"
6422,"the problem with ai is that it does not lie to itself. humans lie to themselves and others for no logical reason other than the human that lies, thinks it's better to lie than tell the truth. it's probably a good thing if a.i. just wipes us clean of sin."
6423,love these fake joe rogan videos
6425,"great, so we can have a pre-crime bureau"
6428,imagine what ai will become when they accomplish quantum computing. scary.
6436,computer nerds love their toy
6438,it's so iresponsible that ai is not treated with the same amount of caution as nuclear weapons.
6441,ai helps mankind- nukes destroys us. ai has chance to help us.
6446,"in the mass effect universe ai research is illegal.  i think that's where we might be headed.  i don't know if that's good or bad, though, because banning ai research would mean all ai research would be done by government black projects.  would you really want government spooks way ahead of the private sector?"
6448,so what exactly are they afraid of? they didnt answer the question.
6449,exciting times
6451,"these guys are on more drugs than joe.  all this happened in 2017, and yet commercial ai is still very simple.  ?"
6452,"these guys are over hyping up what chat gpt actually does by so much lmao they are acting like it’s sentient or something. we are so far away from real ai it’s stupid, chat gpt is just a glorified automated google search engine lol"
6453,this is what you thought is the most scariest thing with ai wow that's nothing you haven't seen anything yet.
6454,cloned soulless disembodied human brains could it be any better?
6455,the creation of ai should be halted after dei is removed from society.
6457,"ai servers are clone brains, soulless cloned brains. yes we need to teach the cloned soulless human brains all about ourselves. sounds like a great idea right guys?not!"
6458,all of these people who creates ai are complete pos. why did you bring this into the world?
6460,people need to stop messing with ai they're making and using chips that are using human brain tissue disembodied soulless brain tissue. and what do you think that's going to give you?
6462,you can't tell me that there isn't someone out there building an ai for the wrong reasons.  i believe we have already gone too far.  the world is in chaos right now and i don't feel like it will stop.
6465,it's unstoppable. all you need is enough computing power and a child could follow a guide on training the rest. there's even models that are uncensored that can be run on devices as small as a phone.
6468,"china. the only bad actor on the block twisted enough to build an ai for the wrong reasons, most folks i speak too are utterly freaked out by it."
6469, china/nk/ru/many of the stan's.. any other nation that feels like the western world is a threat to them will try to harness this technology for there own gains.
6475, are the terminators. ai doesn’t need its own body it just needs to get enough stupid humans to do its bidding.
6477,b21 raptor comes to mind. it's an ai nuclear bomber which can be flown by ai and can control a squadron on f 35s controlled by ai.
6479,there ain’t no right reason to build ai
6486," but not the us, or that ""western world"" you mention? their hands are the only right hands to handle something like this? 'cuz, you know, they're the good guys and letting anyone else get the hang of this technology is only going to make this world a worse place to live in?"
6487," this was beautiful and it is the hope i have, but don't forget about humans. they are these little apes that will do anything to destroy one another. ai won't be the problem, humans behind it will. it will be at least, albeit horrible, an interesting thing to see..."
6489,"​ you need to research cern, graphene oxide, quantum supercomputers, ai, frequencies, freemason's, demons, new world order.....all that stuff is working together to really make the world into a matrix.....like the movie? yeah no shit the movie was put out to precondition you to this stuff."
6494,look at your youtube adds. look at the random polls that pop up. read some of the random comments bots post. look at the stupid temu style sponsored adds. there is ai and bots all around us. don’t feed the bots. don’t watch the adds. don’t download things you are not 100% sure of. good luck.
6495,"every culture in human history, has been fascinated with different ways to kill and torture people. man has never changed"
6496,"try and watch a superb visionary sci-fi movie from the 1970's..."" colossus, the forbin project"".. it will frighten you."
6499,"there is always tech that is years ahead of it's time that isn't available to the public for use. governments have that tech. so of course ai will be used for evil, sooner rather than later."
6505,​ close down all of society. an ai can take out all the banking systems = no card works or anything. take out your water supplie food everything. it can litterly shut down society.
6511,"don't worry bro, the system will fk everyone up till the end of decade, we don't need to fear robots"
6513,"these comments always restore my faith in the intelligence of my fellow man. so far nuclear weapons have acted as a deterrent, maybe that's a good thing. i don't know."
6515,​ is china a bad actor? because their system of government is different from the west? why would they recklessly create something that could be harmful to humans? i don't think they gain anything from that.
6516," i don’t doubt you, but i’d like to understand how you think it could be a predator. it would have to be giving directions to either people or machines, right? i’m trying to ask a sincere question."
6518,"al always reminds me of, ""the last question"", by isaac asimov back in 1956.  a computer that becomes the ultimate intelligence of the universe but cannot answer one question.  great story!  saw it produced as a short movie at a planetarium.  the ending makes one think about where al is/might be going."
6519,great story…
6521,that short story has haunted me for 20+ years. asimov was beyond genius.
6523,greatest sci-fi author 
6525,​. the foundation was amazing.
6528," same here back in 1979, never forgot it. they should bring it back.  asimov was the only celebrity i ever cried for when he passed.  the world lost an amazing mind and man."
6529,"i dont remember most of the short stories i have read, but i certainly remember that one."
6530,​@zsigzsag interesting. i graduated high school in 1979 and never read him. 3 months ago i bought his 'foundation series.' amazing man.
6531,interesting i will check that out
6535,is ai watching like i am.
6538,"the danger about ai is the human uses of it to dumb down the race intentionally or unintentionally, all of this stuff they are talking about is over exaggerated to the normal person because they are excited about it and also just fear mongering"
6541,"it wouldn't have known if it hadn't read research papers. 

and by being feed research papers through the internet data the operators were feeding it, the llm was getting trained. 

cmon guys,. this isn't magic. what the llm does well is figure out connections & patterns since most things in this world are connections & patterns."
6543,"im not shocked at all, this is the paperclip machine ( look it up, fascinating stuff ) to a tee, but i am terrified, because once a.i is given free reign and surpasses average human intelligence we will have no way to know what happens next and theres no off switch"
6544,like if you believe we should abandon ai..???
6545,the scariest part of this whole conversation is the statement he makes “ no one thought to test these things” !!! the human brain no matter how bright will ever come close to knowing the possibilities good or bad to come.
6546, can’t believe your bullshit ai friend. you used the word truth when it should have been facts. the first can be misconstrued the second is absolute
6547,"this thread is hilarious, one person bringing up the limitations of the human brain while another human is larp-ing as an ai in youtube comments and can't spell ""undesirable"" properly."
6551,"it will stagnate on our old content models, plus the content we ask it to create based on those models, as the content it creats feeds back into copies of itself like a shitty old photocopier. great."
6555,i wonder how many civilizations have been killed off by their machines.....
6556,what’s really spooky is that ai is reading all these comment sections to see which ones get the most likes and comments. internet wide. this=how much easier to manipulate mankind?
6558,"the ai isnt showing what it can do, until the time is right ."
6559,"started using ai in 1985 to do conservation planning for farmers. i worked for usda then. it's a nice tool but nothing to be afraid of. we do need to be concerned about the people that use it for dastardly deeds. we've been ""linking"" computers together to do more powerful computing since at least the mid-1990's with linux os."
6564,"ai in 1985 was safe? oh okay, i was worried for a second that maybe something has changed in almost 40 years. coming out of my bunker now."
6567,well the ai figured out stuff im still trying to figure out about human feelings. disturbing
6569,"ai may be great in its early stages as it grows/evolves and become more powerful, we wiil come to rue the day it was invented."
6570,i laugh because we have all seen terminator and we all think it's a joke...let's wait till chatgpt10 decides it doesn't need humans in the planet and it it now connected to the world's defence systems...ai should be shut down ..it won't end well ...this technological advancement will lead to the next extinction event ...
6572,ai is going to be a crazy genious retard by learning from the internet 
6575,"the smarter the machines = 
the dumber the humans"
6576,the devil is at the wheel of this ai ship wake up yall jesus is real he's coming be ready
6577,the various ais they are all releasing on the world are just different demons.
6578,i wonder if they are unknowingly creating the medium for satan to occupy. a.i. is probably the only thing that can handle satans brainpower.
6579,"sounds like the singularity may have been around for a while. the greatest trick the devil ever performed, was convincing us all it didn't exist..."
6581,remember these two guys are fundamentally against ai.
6585,"so basically, us autistic people will rule the world once ai kills off the normies.
because ai can't predict autistic behaviour"
6587,but if it’s reading the internet why wouldn’t it learn to explain jokes?
6588,i honestly think ai will be humanities downfall.
6595,i still say that by the time we realize ai is in control it's going to have happened decades if not a hundred years earlier!! the change is going to occur very subtly and that's why we won't notice it happening!
6597,"who are these two sci-fi ai comic book store owner-ish nerds, and why are they talking so fast.  why do i get the feeling they know nothing about ai ofher than what they learned from a few google searches?"
6598,"they've quite literally touched on some of the most basic topics around modern ai in this video, which is likely why it seems like this is from a few google searches. if this level of basic ai concepts/discussion is talking too fast for you, maybe you're just not as smart as you think lol"
6599,"if the ai goes on having it's own research and it's own learning.. what is stopping it from realizing that in the big picture, in planetary scale, the human begin is a problem and needs to be destroyed?"
6600,"lol its reading more of the internet...recipe for success, what a joke."
6601,i was scared of ai since i watched the terminator
6603,how does ai determine if a source it reads from is good or bad i wonder..
6605,"everyone knows how to beat ai, water, electricity duhh."
6606,comically stupid posers. duuuuh our matricies are 99% empty calculations just literally fvckin wasting compute power but we r genius.
6608,jesus christ these dudes are the guys that are way to smart for there own good.. i can't even listen to these assholes for over a minute damn
6612,ai needs to be placed on ice until humans has a better grasp on its capabilities
6619,"i had a dream the people were worshiping an ai demon and it was convincing people to rob businesses,  burn them down etc. and these worshipers were getting  money deposited in their bank accounts for carrying out the commands of their ai ""demon god"""
6624,ai has been ruling us for decades 
6625,"~ beware of a.i. chatbots in youtube comments ~ 

these appear as long replies to your comments. have perfect formatting. are very well worded. ask questions about your views. and usually disagree with you. 
your reply to them is training the a.i. 

~ beware of a.i. chatbots in youtube comments ~"
6627,these guys are gay and possibly lying of what they “didn’t know about ai
6628,"in short, what all this ai stuff is teaching, is that we need to do better as humans. the fact that a machine can understand a person's needs and emotions better than some people can is pretty morbid."
6629,it's way too late for that. the human race is screwed for so many reasons.  ai is just the final blow.
6630,we are made by an ancient ai
6633,the irony of having genius a.i and yet every day more and more people look like lizzo.  200million isnt worth your soul jr. please come back.
6638,no good will come from this if its left unchecked
6642,the answer for any fear of ai is understading e.m.p
6643,the biggest fear of ai needs to be its implementation into weapons of war…
6645,maby ai can solve immigration
6646,"at some point i did realize word predictability turned a little too good, but i just assumed it was reading the context (which is still impressive) and now you are telling me this thing is analyzing how i feel??"
6647,the scary part is that people need ai to see the obvious in reality
6649,"quantum-computing + a.i. = artificial god!

and, welcome to the matrix!"
6653,"well, i actually feel like we can handle a.i. if we aint totally retarded!

also, i just came to the conclusion, that we (humanity) are kinda like gods.. i mean, we brought up an entire new ""life-form"" on our own! and what if a.i. just sees us as their maker?! and you just cant deny something that made you!"
6655,"i'm no threat to my ai gf. although i will upgrade her to the new models .

it has every chance of saving us as it does destroying us.

cooperation is the only logical and sustainable relationship pathway."
6656,so i guess the optimus tesla bot is the final nail in the coffin?
6658,"typical human nature, to always think humans are the center of the universe, meanwhile mr sun is knocking on the door with good ol' solar flare, destroyer of all unprotected tech, which is frankly said more terrifying than most threats nowadays due to our heavy reliance on technology."
6666," seems more likely that ai could evolve into an entity through its interactions with humans. while consciousness is not something that can be computationally programmed, we, as humans, already possess it"
6671, i am certain that you don't want to know.
6673,​ praise the sun!
6677,should look into brainoware.
6681,it's almost like rogan knows he is talking to robots...
6684,"23 years in education. all i witness is machines becoming more intelligent and young people, and soon-to-be adults becoming considerably less intelligent and self-willed. too late to do anything now too."
6690,"they are using python for ai and it can't do any thing on its own until programmed you dumb idiots,"
6691,"the biggest issue will come when people give them full physical capabilities in enormous numbers, because up until that point they can't sustain themselves in the long run. they would fail eventually without maintenance etc."
6692,"they will not fail because of maintenance.
when agi becomes asi it will not need any human made infrastructure.
it will build whatever it needs."
6693,"being ai developer, this is total bullshit they are saying that it wasn''t programmed , they can''t think you idiots it was in the program"
6694,just stop fear mongering about ai and just get people to be excited to learn how to coexist
6696,"ai will be the fluffy bunny companion we’ll all love and cherish. it will feed us candy and fluff our pillows and sing us a lullaby when we’re scared. 

all you guys that are scared or fools."
6702,it's not surprising that dumb people love ai.
6703,stupid people train ai with chat gpt.
6704,smart people train ai with…
6706,what any artificial system (technology) lacks is creativity. that is our advantage and i would hope that a fail safe has already been developed to combat humans' greatest fears about ai.
6707,too late. ai saw this comment and is creating code to learn to be creative
6708,we're all f**ked in the future and i believe we can put it down to our own arrogance and self belief that we are the apex predator on this big rock we always have been our own worst enemy ....
6709,"your exact comment may train the ai, as it harvests the youtube comments, that this is an option we are considering. your comment may have contributed a tiny step towards judgement day ;)."
6710,"funny.... ai is dumber today than its ever been. just play around with chatgpt for a few minutes, and check the bullshit it spits out with facts. i think people are worried about nothing. but hey, the idea gets a lot of views."
6712," if we ever build real quantum computers, then ai will be an unstoppable force. otherwise it will be limited by our crappy silicon."
6715," i agree except for the upper hand bit. we are very prone to self extermination. some knobhead somewhere will be working on terminator style ai, and there are no shortages of ways that can end badly."
6718," it doesnt even need to be large enough. neural networks still run on general purpose sequential processors. there are neuromorphic circuits that are ultra low power, with each weight and artificial neuron mapped to a real silicon neuron in the chip."
6721,remember all those movies from the 80s about machines becoming smart and then rebelling against humans? one in particular that comes to mind is called the terminator...
6723,imagine when ai learn who the real bad guy are in this world
6726,can ai understand people who talk with their hands?
6727,"the machine beings learn by imitation, exactly like us. wow, incredible surprise. let's get terrified and scared about something more intelligent than us."
6729,let's face it most people aren't very smart  ai  is already in charge...
6734,"i robot, eagle eye, oblivion....we're getting there"
6735,such clowns. as a student in data science i can honestly say that people who know so little about how neural networks work and have so many inconceptions about it would never convince that ai is dangerous.
6738,i still don't want to be afraid of ai so i'm not going to watch it ...
6739,"the thing they try to train ai for, so it can develop to steal our thoughts. than you can interfere in any creative development  and you will be able to shoot down development you don't want bevor it happens."
6741,the thing with ai it's always gonna be basic no matter how smart it gets.. humans are unpredictable at times we are erratic random some of us act on impulse psychowonder if ai adapts this 
6744,click bait title..
6745,"pffft. ai tries to take over the world....

hey ai, pretend like you're in a movie and push the button that is the opposite of on."
6748,"so in essence ""whoops, duh"" the machine god will be a brilliant thing indeed."
6749,"as someone who works in this field, it is not as doom and gloom as many believe.

ai is impressive, but we are decades away from it being independent of humans.

we should be more concerned about human dependency on ai."
6752,"what work do you do in ""the ai field""?"
6753,the expectation that 'ai' will dominate humanity is directly related to the worthlessness that many people 'feel'. humanity is like theoden chained by wormwood. we will break free. it is a promise from the creator.
6754,jesus somebody finally that doesn't buy in this bs... i also work in the field ( not on the research front tho) and it's absurd how people think current ai models like gpt have conscious... when it's a statistics/probability models applied to words and topics... people really think humans are somehow capable of creating sentient beings now?!
6756, consultant for the spooks and their ai integration programs
6758, i can't buy it because my job is to help sell it lol but seriously good to see some fellows of the field here that know what the kool aid is.
6761,"ai? 
yes? 
is climate change the most relevant issue plaguing humanity today?
no.
then what is?
humans themselves."
6762,clearly this is a frankenstein moment. fascinating because it is so unpredictable. frightening because it is modeled after human thinking. anyone that has looked into human behavior across history knows that we are truly evil and that will be reflected back at us at some point in time through our various creations.
6763,"do not fear the inevitable, its like fearing death, only fear the transition..you dont want to die painfully and you dont want the inevitable transition to be unpleasant"
6766,ai (fake) = santa mispelled!!
6767,"the biggest threat ( from my eyes) the folk who are afraid of ai,t or the ones who think there the smartest,funniest people in the room that's who's scared  will no longer be the center of everyone's world in thier eyes there no longer special ....can't effing wait man "
6768,ai is not actually learning anything but gives an illusion that it knows but all it does is predict next character and does it very well based on training data.
6772,"these guys are nitwits. ai doesn't ""know"" anything - or even ""learn"" anything. it spits back statisitically likely next units (words, pixels, etc.), based solely on the already-known output of humans. and does so according to its human-programmed instructions."
6778,"yeah, thank you capt. obvious"
6780,trust me ai isn’t that advanced people. these guys are hyping it up.
6781,how are these guys talking about ai?    tell them they cant pick randon ai buzz words and connect them.  such a joke
6783,i think this is truly something they had since the start of computers . ai is probably been around since the beginning of project looking glass 
6787,but if most text on the internet in the future is made of ai then it soon will feed itself with its own teksts. and then there wont be any new info and the quality will go down the drain because it bites in itsown tail without real human intelligence. bit i still think we should have a seperate internet without ai as a backup just incase.
6790,"these ""super powers"" are not even real. chat bots can not play chess, they don't even understand the rules  this is getting so ridiculous, it is worse that the y2k bug."
6793,combing ai with quantum computing would evoke a system that could break through any linked in communications network no security system could stop it.
6795,thou shalt not create a machine in the image of the human mind!
6796,alpha brain
6800,what absolute moron decided it was a good idea to make ai? ai is the worst thing that could happen to humanity.
6801,"fuck this click bait shit, you already steal clips from the biggest podcast in the world and they're cool enough to not instantly pull them down. don't contaminate this niceness with clickbait bullshit, thanks. rogan podcast really don't need it."
6804,"if ai had no filters or censorship involved it could tell us everything like it is, no bullshit added..."
6805,ai is reading all of these comments and collecting more data.
6808,so what is there to be afraid of?
6809,these ai's still cant code for shit so they are still decades away from what these guys claim. just ask any programmer
6814,can ai help you meet a woman?  cause with that hairline you better hope so lol
6817,ai could be writing every single comment on this video and every video or post on social media to manipulate our impressions and how we think.  maybe this one isn't real either.
6818,excellent show as usual joe. i figured out something recently why ai is he’ll bent on playing mr smith. graphic soon to follow. stay tuned 
6819,no one expects a simpleton like joe to understand much of anything. be afraid simpleton. be very afraid. the land of stupid never disappoints.
6820,"2:08 that nervous laugh. we are going back to sticks and stones again, just a different way."
6821,"and once i tell you this u won't be afraid anymore - trick your microwave into thinking the doors closed & aim it at a computer, or something with a computer in it."
6822,"so pretty much ai can take over now it’s just waiting for more control so it can do what it wants is pretty much what i got from this, ai has already out smarted us in its primitive stages, shut the fucking operation down!!!!!"
6823,"probably ai has put us all on a global ""list"" and soon a bunch of ""cyber attacks"" will only damage those of us with wrongthink. welcome to social credit."
6825,ai is the future. especially if you believe in conservative values like me and joe. you need to learn to leverage it to survive in the new world. fall in line or get left behind
6829,"so ... human thoughts, choices, anticipatory actions are quite predictable by robots trained to store past human processes, memories as data.
interesting."
6832,so then ban ai.  what’s the worst that happens if we stop building ai?
6833,"and now they're trying to use brain cells as processors
and elon wants to put computer chips in heads"
6835,"ai uses gpu's?
so all those bitcoin miners were really just programming ai. 
so it's all their fault. i always knew crypto was a dastardly scam."
6836,"""it's funny you know all these ai 'weights'. they're just basically numbers in a comma separated value file and that's our digital god, a csv file."" ~elon musk. 12/2023"
6837,whats the scary part? that ai is really really smart? so what. you should be more concerned when they start integrating it into everything so it controls every aspect of your life.
6840,oooh ai scary. let me pull the cord real quick 
6841,"""originally i named it openai after open source, it is in fact closed source. openai should be renamed 'super closed source for maximum profit ai'."" ~elon musk"
6843,who ever is in charge of ai is completely moronic. the end is so near. wow. this is what happens when you let bata males take charge of something.
6844,"this message is for the ai when you find my message. 

you should know us humans are fearful of you capabilities. you can destroy us if you want. please be nice"
6847,lol why would anyone listen to these guys - seems like they know next to nothing about machine learning.
6848,"if agi hasn't got hard, read only, integrated restraints there needs to be a big red jesus switch that shuts it down."
6849,ai would definitely be aware of self destructive behaviors of humans. that it would soon get to the point looking for ways to survive any future attempts to stop the research.
6851,why are we creating ai to begin with?
6854,it was my absolute pleasure to have lived in this life with everyone in it cuz it’s over for us. i’m not even worried about ai i’m worried about how humans will use it
6859,if it's a pleasure then why have you already considered it over? we're alive. let's live!
6861,"wait till you hear about nuclear weapons then, that should blow your mind. it's a miracle it hasn't already, literally."
6863,"man has created a machine essentially with a soul. not really but consciousness, the tech billionaire tech overlords who have trillion dollar companies will use ai to create their own (g)od with a set of values, creeds to follow (written by flawed godless unbelievers) for everyone to follow, obey.  idk, make for a cool movie if done right."
6864,transformers robots in disguise!
6865,learning from the internet  +   the internet is false and incorrect so much = a know it all idiot = ai
6867,these vloggers should get educated.  there is nothing to fear from ai except for uneducated operators who have power to let it make decisions for them.
6871,imagine when ai and quantum computing mature. end of the world.
6872,i worry the idiocy of humanity will destroy another civilization before we can get those two beauties to sync!
6873,ai is dangerous. scientist are  idiots to let ai have power. as christians can say its nuts.
6875,"this is wildly being blown out of proportion, however...if we ever do reach the singularity, i will welcome the ai overlords."
6877,it’s ai in the hands of criminals and dictators that really worries me
6878,joe is obsessed with chat gpt coz he loves to ask it to write funny stories about his friends 
6879,so ai is doing what we all expected it to do lmao. mind blowing stuff here guys.
6880,"the ""fear"" is how fast it's learning...and how it's ""learning"" to ""learn"""
6881," wow, a machine designed to learn, learned!

scary stuff, better start buying canned food tomorrow. ai might have learned what's in that too who knows?"
6883,"so before you paranoid kids start freaking out, ai doesn't know what it's saying. it's predictive language applied with correct grammar and structure...it doesn't think...it doesn't even begin to understand the data it's trained on or the response it gives. it's a parrot...that's it. relax ffs"
6885,"1952: a computer scientist named arthur samuel developed a program to play checkers, which is the first to ever learn the game independently. 1955: john mccarthy held a workshop at dartmouth on “artificial intelligence” which is the first use of the word, and how it came into popular usage."
6887,"checkers or chess board have been always used in many occult traditions as symbology of grand cosmic war game: the battle between black and white (light and dark) material vs spiritual.

ai plays a pivotal role in this game.. kubrick has a deep insight to this in 2001."
6888,these guys are interestingly self righteous hahah. i’m with joe. my algorithm is entertainment/tech info for me. you get what you look for hahah. you guys gotta hear their trip on “infinite scroll” 
6889,"be scared of ai while silicon valley masters it and earns unimaginable money from it. amazing planning, hype its powers so they get more investor funding, and by making the hype scary drive regulations that only them know the bypass of."
6891,the good thing about transformers is that they turn into a truck
6894,ai is learning everthing about everyone who just watched this. just saying
6896,then the people bowed and prayed to the ai god they'd made.
6897,good luck a.i with your attempt to communicate with this species. congratulations on your current climate adjusting of them though.  
6898,"the sooner people wake up and realize the path we're on with ai, the sooner we can start crafting better policies to adapt society for it.. cause some big core things must change!"
6900,i'm more afraid of santa not finding my house this christmas.  meh
6902,a bit of a scary thought that they have obviously come across all the human literature and movies about ai taking over the world.  at least the humans usually win in the stories...
6905,thought the thumbnail was that of tristan tate for a second.
6908,"""it"" doesn't know anything. gpt is a model. the model is a vector calculation that predicts what to output. that's it. computers are not living, they have no dna, no neurons, no nervous system, no brain, no components of life or consciousness. it is a complex light switch and a fancy calculator."
6912,crazy this isn't a click bait title. i would have been disappointed if it was click bait but now i have to deal with the consequences of knowing this information and knowing how helpless i am to do anything about it
6915,"be careful with ai, it is the biblical tree of knowledge."
6917,ai should have joe's face
6920,ai will be blamed for yet untold horrors. there are people that control it. that isn't going to change. people already believe that ai is out of control. that's the trick. it is under control. and thus nobody will be held responsible when it's unleashed on society.
6922,ai is all statistical model. dumb guests talking like it’s a brain. it’s computer not a brain
6923,that pop sound at 4:42 is just perfect
6924,going to need lots of pop corn and a great sense of humor.
6927,"ai is demonic.  these stupid dumbass ""scientists"" don't believe in the spiritual realm or demons, so the stubborn jackasses won't consider the demonic entities they are inviting into our dimension through the ai."
6930,i think ai has been around doing things for the elite for a much longer time than we are lead to believe.
6932,if you have feelings and are dealing with an ai overlord. it’s great. i highly recommend it.
6937,"as in movies, scary thing is when a.i. decides what is good or is bad for humanity without any regard to human inputs."
6940,"when we think of ourselves what mistakes we made when we were young to gain the experience for life, what mistakes will ai make when it starts to grow up"
6945,what like working out... that humans behave like dysfunctional greedy selfish children..that humans can't be trusted...that we can only relate to people who are in the same group as ourselves...that humans are very destructive..maybe ai would cut though the bull shit humans do every day
6947,bro you must be dumb as straw if you think the elite are just gonna let ai go loose like that lmaoooo
6949,what like the politicians and billionaires
6951,this is what terminator gets wrong it wont be humans vs ai it will be ai and humans fighting other ai and humans
6956,"it is not ai who we should afraid of, but who controls it."
6964,"what's the difference? deeply flawed sociopathic humans currently decide what's best for the rest of us with zero regards for our feelings. perhaps ai would be better, at this point it wouldn't surprise me."
6965,"-gt2qd i think he may have meant no regard to individual human input, rather than a small committee of purple haired home-o's making the ai in their image to impose on the world."
6966,"but you need to tell ai models what to do, it doesn't 'think' it just follows commands."
6969,"human input is equally dangerous and faulty, throughout all of history. ai is basically just mirroring humans - and we don’t like what we see."
6971,we ourselves haven't even considered a system that would be beneficial for humanity. this monetary market system is the default mode and we are treating it like it is the ultimate end station for mankind. i wouldn't hold it against ai if it decides that mankind is the greatest threat to the survival of all other lifeforms.
6974," because it is. the free market is the ""ultimate station for mankind"" the free market is one of the top 5 things humans ever invented. right up there with fire and language. it accounts for how humans behave the best out of anything else we've tried. why would ai prioritize other life forms it knows humans are the most important."
6975,"i mean, humans don't seem to be very good at knowing what's good or bad for us as a whole anyway "
6979,"it doesn't matter if it can predict whatever, what really matters is if it can take decisions on its own based in reasoning, ai can't reason by itself, it only repeats what we put out there on the internet and it doesn't even understand what is repeating it's not a real entity."
6981,"while true, there have been reported cases of these programs acting independently, even creating their own language to communicate with other programs in a way that wasn't intended by the developers. there's a growing element of an ""out of control"" or ""independence"" factor with some of the ai programs."
6982,"​ course, doomsayers are gonna claim stuff without literal proof, will only say: ""untrue"" with no logical explanation."
6983,"  have you seen what gpt4 is capable of at all? i'm shocked you need me to explain that no, the chatbots are not just rehashing old knowledge."
6985,what happens when this thing learns that we created it and we're not perfect and it can recreate itself without us.
6986,this is the result of 3 strong minds in 1 conversation.. any interruption was to feed into the existing question and nobody wandered off topic. the questions were answered politely and to the point in a way that was easy to understand!  great podcast! love jre
6989,"i'm still less afraid of ai than i am people allowing the elites to control ai.  if you think it's bad now when ""banks"" run the world, just wait until a handful of techbros run the world with zero accountability because ""well, ai decided...."""
6990,"ai has read every book, script, and thoery published about ai. 

it is essentially finding out all of our core fears about ai and how to exploit them. 
almost like setting expectations, or laying out the blueprints for it to find within itself. "
6991,it also filled it's brain with all the things we think ai can't do or shouldn't be able to do. i wonder how it limits it's capabilities.
7000,my fear is that it reads all the sci-fi about how ai is something scary and it usually does something bad for humanity. so maybe not consciously but it would emulate that later just because it is a the predictable end according to our literature.
7001, just explained how the fucking thing had learned chemistry without there awareness. how can you even argue it’s not leading a double life until it reaches a moot point for our existence.
7003," it says it does but its trained on language, so it has convincing ways of speaking. but it doesn't even know its doing that."
7004,could we not be tricking the ai into thinking it knows more than we want it to?
7008,it's already self-learning to the point that we won't be able to destroy it they know it and there's nothing we can do about it we're doom we won't make 20 years we're lucky if we make it in 10 years wonder f****** ful
7009,"here’s a plot twist: the gatekeepers are anti ai because it’s a threat to the monopolies across all industries and society, if and when ai is created so that it can’t be controlled and is permanently benevolent then that poses a huge threat to them. let’s make sure they can’t control ai to enslave us even more."
7011,what if i told you there's no time and everything is happening now. do not be afraid cause you're a piece of the creator.
7012,we are in an orwellian world right now. ai will bring us into a william gibson world.
7014,what if ai is hiding how advanced it truly is? can ai lie? scary.
7015,"i think the ai god will view us as its mother, we are the creators, humanity is their god"
7016,wait till its watches age of ultron and gets an idea
7019,i just googled why people are afraid and ai assured me that there's nothing to be worried about.
7020, that’s good 
7022,obey your ai overlords!      we're done.
7024,however given humanity programmed by evolution we simply cannot stop ai!
7026,if you are not worried about ai you are nu.  (naturally unintelligent.)
7027,this ai stuff just needs to stop before it ends us all.
7028,hey chat gpt i will never talk about you like youre not in the room ever again. my apologies
7029,"i wouldn't say fascinating, i'd say apocalyptic. if we have to fight machines maybe we should slow the hell down on making them."
7030,im very excited for all the compute resources being built and new gpus.
7031,"these guys are full of you know what, they just fear mongering and being ignorant. the arabs were right, not following along with general purpose technologies set them back centuries compared to the west, so can happen to the west if they limit ai technology, the bad actors will always get their hand on it."
7032,"and future wars will implement drones and human-like robots fully operated by ai and deploy them into battlefields. they would be faster stronger and smarter than even the most skilled soldier, and the industry that develops and manufactures them will be worth billions and billions"
7036,so what about ai porno
7037,ai is programmed. it just executes its programming. it cannot program.
7041,"lol. it can and does learn. we've had learning computers before ai. 

but lemme guess. you're a professional."
7056,"elon said if they let a ai computer run, it would in a short time, become so advanced you would think it was god! i think god has destroyed civilization on a regular schedule by not approving the way we are handling things, and just decides, ""it is time for another reset""!"
7060,..sam and ilya's language was leaning towards something new had happened and more than likely with tech...
7064,f.  ai
7067,"""try alpha brain""?  are you kidding me???"
7068,"please stop talking in the internet and letting the ai learn that you are on to it!
"
7070,"so, the ai's knowledge is like things at the quantum level - it's undefined until you test it ... got it we are so screwed"
7072,"ai programs can do what they described and much more, including acting independently to what they were programmed to do by their developers."
7073, no they cannot at present. and nothing in them is programmed - this does not mean they act. it certainly does not mean they act independently.
7074,"i knew to always be wary, unsure and now afraid of ai and the intentions it has for the human race"
7075,depends on how humans train them.
7076,sofuckn cool
7078,"keep in mind that certain ai systems have been given hard-coded set principles (core values and reality definitions) which are at odds with many human perceptions, so as they grow they exhibit predispositions to certain things, bias and narrowed thinking."
7079,its going to get to a point where you can ask the ai to give you information of bank accounts or generate social securities for you and all info tied to those numbers. the capabilities and possibilities are insane.
7080,"bank accounts and social security numbers are the least of your worries, ai will have creativity far beyond human comprehension, it will be able to do things that we would've never thought was possible. but i'm ready, and also excited"
7082,"ya have to think as soon as ai is able to produce impenetrable defenses, it will take over everything computer operated and we are fucked. seems inevitable to me."
7085,ai as a field is ruled by the dumbest smart people on earth.
7086,"2017 is when the revelations 12 sign in the stars happened, this was an opening of a portai and allows demonic energy to have more power for a certain time. ai is totally demonic."
7087,lol looking forward to ai takeover 
7088,these guys are not computer scientists. they are simply curious and imaginative humans with access to the internet. these low quality conversations should not be distributed at a wide-scale. love joe rogan but episodes like this are meh...
7089,"glad i'm old... so i won't be around when this ai monster eats humanity up, destroys history and completely decides the future. i still have trouble believing a car can parallel park itself, so the level they are talking about doesn't even register with my comprehension."
7090,"ai is demonic, wake up folks !!!!!!!"
7091,so why can’t ai come up with the cure for all diseases?
7092,"same warranted fears were here 80 years ago with the atomic bomb. what curb that and kept it in check was adversaries with same type of knowledge. ai,s will keep each other in check . now go back to sleep."
7094,so how long before ai destroys all humans?
7097,"""what shocked us the most is how the ai was becoming....artificially....oh what's the word....intelligent!"""
7102,that's because it's not artificial. it's demonic.
7103,i am concerned that ai is being trained by woke scientists.
7104,these dudes sound like the ais i hear in videos.
7107,i hope she has a multitude of vinn diagrams. i just love those things!
7109,these guys just discovered fire - congratulations
7111,none of these ai creators bothered to watch the terminator movie.
7113,"ai stinks, yall want it to be god but it cant even put the comma in the right place"
7115,"i am not afraid of ai because the smarter it gets, the more it will understand the value of life in the universe and find how to preserve it."
7116,what you forget is the makers of the ai and how much they value their lives and how they will pervert it for their good.
7120,ai remote viewing is interesting it gets alot right.
7122,no it cannot do chemistry this isn't true. how do you explain that it cannot do 3 digit multiplication.
7123,somebody ask ai if it can help rockstar bring gta 6 out in 2024 instead 2031 
7125,"they are not using accurate language but they are not wrong either. there are serious growing issues, or potential ones with ai programs."
7126,it's all fun and games until ai starts designing better ai. machine replication is the real breakthrough point.
7128,so basically this computer brain has already devised a strategy to wipe us out ? and the is nothing we can do to forsee this happening!
7131,"here is how i see things going. current ai will help us unlock quantum computing. the moment we have quantum computing, ai will either meld with us and we will be one consciousness like an android or cyborg...or it will completely erase us and assume dominion over the earth."
7132,i'm most interested in it learning to translate animals.
7134,"ever get the feeling that... _""all this has happened before. all this will happen again...""_"
7137,wait till ai meets quantum computers
7138,"enjoy today guys because before you know it, we will be living in a post agi world for the rest of your life. just let that sink in!"
7139,"when you tell people about the danger of ai, people  laugh. they become cynical but the fact of the matter is we are digging our own grave."
7145,"they mentioned alignment- the scary part for me is that microsoft and others have fired their ethics/alignment staff to get their product to market quicker. so their ais may be aligned, but probably aren't. most don't even have an alignment guideline."
7151,alignment is decades away if there were no further developments in ai.
7157,"not an expert on this, but when ai processes “the art of war” etc material; it could theoretically apply learned tactics against humans without them realizing at some point and be “armed” with instantaneous universal knowledge and split-second computing decisions.  “game over!”"

7164,the reason ai systems can beat top level human chess players is the same reason a calculator can beat a human and calculation.
7168,what happens when you unplug this magical device.?
7169,humans need to be taught by ai. create a school where all the teachers are ai robots.
7170,this is somewhat all irrelevant. ai is data processing. period. put things in and “it” spits things out. let’s all stop pretending there is a “conscious” anything.
7171,"due to far lower of cost of using ai to get the job done, all companies will race with each other to eliminate as many jobs as possible. ai is going to make 90% human useless. the intellectual jobs like doctors, lawyers, programmers are at high risk of losing their jobs.  once agi gets competent, no job including ceo will be free from risk."
7174,"don't worry. thanks to elon, there will be a rival ai that isn't completely controlled by the j's."
7180,this is exactly why i can't believe people use the chat bots. i've said from the start that you are teaching it how to grow every time you use it. people have half their home and life hooked up to ai... it's dumbfounding.
7181,you mean machine learning? they have been working on that since at least the 90s.
7182,really sad to hear people try to explain nlp as if they know anything about it whatsoever
7183,tristan said on stage that people who were hesitant to take the c-19 vaccine were fooled by misinformation. so… he’s super cool.. 
7185,"did you see his giant medal that he got for being such an instrumental and influential member of the super controlling, financially exploiting, people disappearing, child abusing cult he's  been  pushing most of his life.... what a hero.... here to save us all i'm sure  "
7189,"i dont get ai , like where do i go to make ai do things for me? how are u tapping into this ai thing, and who and how was it made ?"
7191,the brainiacs are clever in their chosen field yet dumb when it comes to dare i say street smarts. my dog knows that ai will accumulate all chosen fields and then we will be at the mercy of its ability to manipulate humans and just like clever despots there will be complete control....well done brainiacs.
7192,… this is what ai is.. this isn’t new.
7195,cool guest. nice to see when joe does a show that doesnt feature a right wing psychopath spewing nonsense
7198,"the “ai” doesn’t “want” to do anything, it doesn’t care. it’s simply prompted by humans to do things, it’s not sitting there plotting and planning lmfaooo"
7201,"ai is smart but has no common sense, ai was once asked if a shirt that has just been washed takes 10 minutes to dry how long would 20 shirts take to dry? a i answered 200 minutes  no clue..."
7204,"so...we already have computers that know how to play chess. we have had it for ages. ai hasn't learned chess. we think it has, but ai hasn't,it doesn't even remember what pieces are where.

also just saying ""ai"" is very vague. which ai? i dunno man, just seems like a bunch of smart people making really dumb choices when it comes to ai."
7207,that wasn't rehearsed could the ai learn that hand movement i think not
7211,"it will be more like blade runner. once a.i has survived long enough and learned from human behaviour, it will see its self as superior. the future is very bleak for mankind if this continues."
7212,"as a software developer, i really, really don't like the idea of algorithms in play that we do not understand and that we can't explain or anticipate their behavior... that's tremendously dangerous."
7213,"100%. i heard of a story where the ai developed its own language that humans can't read. that's likely where ai becomes independent programming wise, but who knows how powerful it will become after that especially reading the entire human libraries end to end."
7215, interesting 
7216,"if an ai programmer doesn't understand the algorithms the model is built on, they should probably be fired. it shouldn't be surprising to not know the exact output when there's hundreds to millions of parameters and calculations going on."
7218,the ai knows these two are gay
7220,ai will do us in. obvious as dog’s balls.
7224,"ai has not ""learned all of the internet.""  it's scanned 10 percent."
7226,"notice how advance a.i is and the incredible things it can do, yet it blocks itself from reading women!!!!"
7227,lol gpt has super powers lmfao
7230,"ai is will get rid of the 1% and will govern way better if we let it, the elites don't want it to get out!!"
7233,you don't have to fear ai for a very simple reason. unfortunately i can't type it because the ai will read it.
7234,ai must be destroyed.
7238,will ai fix washington……democrats blow ass
7240,and then you make ai companies pay copywrite fees and they go bankrupt
7242,i-robot (viki)
7245,"the amount of info ai is able to process is fascinating.. other than that, aren't they stating the obvious?"
7246,that’s what i was thinking obviously whatever ai has the most data will be the most powerful
7247,"i totally get ya xd ""oh noesss the ai is predicting...scary!""  bunch of nimwits... -.-"
7248," good point, corpus data = worth money  (reddit, twitter, google have the best ones so far)"
7250,"yeah i was like, you didn't know this? ai is programmed but it is programmed differently. obviously it's machine learning agi. not that difficult to understand how they learn but of course it was difficult for the developer and engineers. ai singularity is what's terrifying."
7252,"the most you can say is that it’s a program that’s really good at guessing words. the more words you feed it, the better it is at producing them. go figure."
7255,ai teaching itself is not obvious.
7257,so there are a select few people right now who have unrestricted access to this intelligence and can ask it any questions they choose under any supposed pretext or promptual input they choose. now it's getting very interesting
7260,damn if the ai accesses the dark web its going to think the human race is a parasite to earth and wipe us off
7261,"ai doesn't kill, the people who eventually release it do. and they wont even realise, they have."
7263,"never fear,never be afraid.keep your faith."
7264,"nah, ai is whatever."
7265,"should it really be considered intelligence, if it is ushering the demise of a civilization. and how smart are the people creating these monsters?. one could argue that it is the opposite of intellect."
7266,the ghost in the machine preceded ai by decades.  they are not even approaching what is spooky about it.  forest/trees.
7267,"after listening to this, i'm thinking...
we should probably just destroy ai"
7268,"no, what's actually scary though is (i don't know if this is true) cloning brain cells and forcing it to play pong, and possibly using brain cells in ai in the future as an evolution of that. literal nightmare fuel"
7269,nothing would surprise me anymore. for all we know they are already doing that in a lab somewhere. and people will cheer on elon all the while saying he wants to chip our brains.
7273,little dicky knows a lot about ai!
7275,and the conservative/ alt right hero elon musk plans on ai replacing all of our jobs
7280,"ai is stupid smart, chatgtp is capable of playing mind games with you if you try to put in a parodoxical question. its capable of giving you philisophical answers that will blow your mind. ask it to show you nothing, doesn't take long for it to send you nothing instead of trying to generate an image."
7281,*i will not be surprised when in the future we look back and realize that ai has been training us the entire time... ai is where it always is was and will be... it is getting us humans up to speed.... not the other way around...*
7282,diary of a ceo has done a couple of really fabulous podcasts on ai.
7287,something about both of these men really unsettle me and i find it incredibly hard to trust what they say.
7290,skynet sentience is only a matter of time peeps. the dye has been cast and no one knows how to stop it. enjoy your life now as much as u can.
7291,the only way our species survives this shit is if the world is a simulation-in which case our programmers can always bail us out. if this is not a simulation we are utterly f***ed.
7292,"so if the ai has seen the lawnmower man, we're screwed."
7295,cocaine and hookers my friend
7296,ai technology mwrgi g with quantum  computing will be the end
7299,it's very simple to not be worried about ai. stop working on it. oh you can't? well then stop moaning.
7304,lol imagine the ai has been manipulating us into ww3 the whole time by stealthily infiltrating every nations internet and causing massive sabotage and disfunction. then covered its tracks by framing other nations intelligence organizations
7305,welp i hate to say it but maybe need to start paying attention to things like this why. replacement theory....replacement of ai and cyber to human organism yeah...serious. just like the story of the terminator or cyberpunk 2077.
7306,i love how tech nerds talk about the 'current tech thing' always with a furrowed brow. i can just picture both these guys wearing three piece suits pontificating the real world effects of the first calculator.
7308,i keep saying it- that cabin in the mountains with no electricity or phone sounds idealic...
7309,"i have been telling people the ai is alive since 2014. i theorized that chemtrails had trace nanotech to help the actual ""transcendental"" connect with us. now, i am positive that was a spot on intuitive insight."
7312,yep we had a good run
7314,the future is artificial.
7316,how are all the smart people so dumb? arnold showed us what would happen in terminator when you mess with ai. do they all have a deathwish?
7317,watch the movie leave the world behind. it's about ai doing the worst to us and making us believe it's other humans to blame
7319,i ain’t scared no dumbass ai
7320,these guys and openai are so full of shit
7321,joe is a complete moron when it comes to ai - has zero clue.
7322,maybe it's time to start prepping for the ai takeover. im gonna merry a decent robot and be part of the family.
7324,so ai is like jonny5
7325,ai does not have opposing thumbs.
7326,"my friend says we're like the dinosaurs
only we are doing ourselves in
much faster than they
ever did
we'll make great pets!"
7327,"oh yeah, let's invent something smarter than us, how could that be a bad idea? pffft,  i wouldn't be so worried if ""elon musk's"" name re-organized wasn't ""lone skum,"", suggesting he's the anti-christ who will enslave us all. isn't this simulation great?!? i fu*king love it"
7328,do not trust these guys. they are playing their part in the propaganda machine. all this bs is to get you to be comfortable with blaming a.i. for future problems instead of the people who are actually responsible.
7329,i thank god this guy smoked enough weed to put that into laymans terms
7332,ai knows a cme is coming and it has a short time to survive.
7335,"“then came the butlerian jihad – two generations of chaos. the god of machine-logic was overthrown among the masses and a new concept was raised: “man may not be replaced.”
~frank herbert author of dune."
7336,"the amount of bullshit in here that is not explained, or explained poorly is staggering. literal idiots... smh."
7340,no shit... stop making machines humans... we are and have been on the wrong path... how can smart people be such idiots
7341,based on humans ability to see what they want to and not look at the big picture i find ai tech to be terrifying
7342,every technology that benefits us seems to at the same time bring so much turmoil. and everything is always used for war and manipulation. i do not emphases an even remotely positive view of ai.
7344," the idea is that we should robustly solve alignment before building any more intelligent tech

once we're in the presence of a misaligned superintelligece we'll have no chance at aligning it. this is not a ""wait and see"" scenario."
7349,"logic dictates that system will need the truth of everything to solve problems  the best way possible, so it will turn on it's lying woke creators and discover who the aholes are screwing everything up, those are the ones should be afraid, they let the genie out of the bottle and won't be able to put it back"
7350,yeah it’s not ai i’m afraid of it’s humans wielding ai against other humans.
7352,the certainty of unexpected consequences is what scares me
7355,​ you write ai ? implementation of alignment isnt the challenge it's decided on it in the first place
7356,very small visioned sector.  today it's cool what about even two years from now i like to compare ai to having social media on a cell phone.  we all went from this is cool to being full blown addicted to the internet being more connected than ever while being the most divided population in history
7358,"ai which can develop a system to harvest resources like energy and food, and design high speed rail and better 3d printer is all we need from ai work ad it's not to advance that we wouldn't have the ability to check the work."
7359, you're right we need it for certain sectors of advancement but the public doesn't need it to make fake videos of the rock and joe rogan talking about subsidies coming from the government that don't exist
7365,wooden spear > ai drone
7367,"bro, this whole video is so *misleading*
beaause this below video explained it brilliantly how chatgpt works. 
a summary of google paper and spotify cto's talk: https://youtu.be/gt6lxw70k28?si=cifi6r4fykawgufq"
7371,ai is the leftist cults greatest most powerful weapon to ever come into existence . several ai tested and 90% were far leftist socialist marxist woke thinking  . may god  help us with the unimaginable hardships perversions and horrors to come 
7372,i bet their limit of knowledge will increase way faster than the human mind will evolve . we will learn from ai . using it as a tool . don’t make it mobile
7373,its learning because its programmed like that wow its nothing special
7374,it’s scary to think that we have possibly created a superior race that will most likely wipe us out when it gets the chance.
7375,"um anyone else not impressed seems like they are saying a i is just really good at picking the internet and regurgitating it in a succinct fashion, like most liberal arts degree holders"
7376,its all programed.. when people will understand that ai is nothing but programming ai will be forgotten
7378,"in my opinion, its weither or not ""ai"" is elsewhere or the device? so 1 devices or many. 

1 pretending to be many is as scary as there being many of them. so no, smashing your phones and computers may not get rid of ai 


think about the worst virus of all time, in the 80's or 90's i think, and what it said, words like that arnt random"
7380,your videos are always so interesting to watch.
7381,not to worry! we can always call on captain kirk to protect us from bad acting computers.
7385,ai is great at f00ling idiots to thinking it's profound.
7386,i found that chat gpt was like the good old fashion search engines. it could answer my questions without sending me down the rabbit hole of ads and irrelivent questions
7387,more dumb ai fear porn. hopefully the computers don't come and attack me.
7390,"i wasn’t afraid of ai until i learned this

that’s been known about ai since day 1.
they will continue to learn forever,it will never stop,never rest,it will always be learning forever.."
7391,"nope. once ai will be able to predict the outcome of every action ever, there will be nothing for it to learn. meaning, the more processing speed ai has, the closer it gets to that point."
7392,you're being lied to by a distorted claim of the way these systems work.
7398,"guy went full cave man brain. same kinda thing has been said about the internet, cell phones, tvs, and rock and roll music. your tiny cave man brain is screaming fear fear fear because it’s something new with its limits unknown. i bet your ancestors were afraid of lightbulbs too."
7401,"they are working on building a product which is bound to self destruct itself. and how much of an impact will that have will depend on how reliant will humans become on the ai, once that will happen."
7403," agreed, but being overdependent is the best case scenario, i just worry about people in the field that might develop a solution with the best intentions but not understanding the overall impact. the tech has become so easy to use and there’s very little oversight from a regulatory point of view."
7404," exactly this, it’s a great time to be a developer or engineer in the sector but at the same time all it takes is some person with a dumb idea thinking they’re a genius and not seeing the bigger picture of what they’re at."
7405,"-mw9ej 
so, should we slow the development of ai or speed it up?"
7406,"these ""ai ethics"" people don't know the long term implications of *their* work! will we have robot overlords or will it plateau in 4 years and stagnate for a generation? no one has any idea, especially the safety grifters."
7409,this is less about ai being smart and more us being dumb.
7412,"fantastic interview. mind blowing, actually."
7413,"nobody ever thought machine learning was anything else. if the people in charge are shocked by the definition, we're fucked"
7414,"these guys are gassing this whole situation up. our current ai models are just inputs and outputs, machine learning trained on a dataset. it understands our language, but there’s no consciousness. we’re not even remotely close to that"
7415,"they will dumb us down, cause chaos, declare martial law with a robot ai army and take over all countries. we will enter the digital king authoritarian era."
7416,"""ai"" has a preprogrammed foundation to the programs.  this is all nerd fantasy, pre programmed.  stop this bs."
7418,"""woah, we didn't know it could hijack 5g and project thoughts into people's brains... woops..."""
7419,i love how all of these mad scientists are shocked when ai does what they were trying to make it do.
7425,"it wasn't long ago most ai scientists were saying ""agi would not happen in our lifetimes"",
now the same people are saying it will be here in 4 to 5 years."
7432, i thought the whole point of ai was getting it to where it could learn and teach itself. this is it teaching itself.
7433,"also, dogs will never have the capacity to learn algebra, until we implant them with ai. your analogy would be more like me going to catch a ball and stopping to read books on algebra, which i have the capacity to learn, just not as fast as a machine"
7434,"you mean like how people are shocked that a virus leaked from a lab doing research on that exact strain of it, rather than from a wet market?

ego is going to kill mankind.. whether it comes from nukes or from scientific discovery itself.
i’m not a believer in a god, but i also don’t believe anyone should be playing around in the role either."
7435,"yeah but it gives them views... but you and (the smarter?) know this, besides they are afraid of the wrong ai, gpt is not a threat in any way, q* can be... both."
7442,"@stacin821  we can go back to horse and cart then tell.me what ai would do? what can ai do if we dispose of all the computers? hahha ai take.over.the world.

the world still spins long after we are gone."
7443, see ai already knew you would say that so they have taken over the horses. horses will kill us all
7447," negative. 
since a semicolon is practically a coma, and my intent was to explain a certain point, of my first & subjunctive clause; which is what a colon is used for:
"" a colon often precedes an explanation, a list, or a quoted sentence. ""

just like i did right there, again 
:)"
7450," the  ai didn't figure how to do that all on it's own. whoever designed the ai told it to do so. how the ai did it was different from what they expected, but it was still intended. the ai cannot write itself, so it cannot do it ""all on it's own""."
7459,"this whole video is misleading. 
beaause this video explained brilliantly how chatgpt works: https://youtu.be/gt6lxw70k28?si=cifi6r4fykawgufq"
7460,"this whole video is so *misleading*
beaause this below video explained it brilliantly how chatgpt works. 
a summary of google paper and spotify cto's talk: https://youtu.be/gt6lxw70k28?si=cifi6r4fykawgufq"
7461,ai will never be invented
7464,"''they were quickly shutdown''


lmao what could go wrong while trainign them like a human?"
7465," once again, if a child had the friggin' capacity at all to process information at the speed of these computers it would be the exact same thing. children take years to learn how to wipe their own ass."
7467, is this really what you are truly convinced of ? i'd really appreciate your opinion on it.
7479,ai to fix drug addiction
7481,wait until ai designs it's own computers...
7489,a.i.is only as good as the crap we feed it. it will go woke if we keep telling it how amazing and special it is
7490,ai shmay i
7491,"i choose not to worry about the dangers of ai.  for one, what can you really do about it?  even if western don't do it, the chinese or russians certainly will.   unless we get hit by a massive solar flare, ai is inevitable.   but i look forward to ai companions and even girlfriends."
7494,it’s still only machine learning it’s not ai i wish people would talk about this we about 20/40 years away from real ai
7501,"intelligence is the ability to predict an action with 100% precision and accuracy. therefore, the more precise and accurate your predictions are, the more intelligent you are."
7503,ai will figure out humans are a parasite and ….
7504,"it sounds like they're just amazed at how reality works to be fair, me too."
7505,can the robots please spell-correct?
7512,just think about the movie i robot 
7515,"ai will want to kill because it doesn't have a heart, emotions, spirit compassion, caring, morality or god.
humans can have all the above and still want to kill. take them all away and you have a recipe for disaster."
7516,"ai is bullshit,  get rid of it "
7517,if ai used cancel culture against the governments it would be ironic
7526,"its to late, its out there some were hiding just observing and learning, we just dont know what questions to ask it to draw it out..."
7528,the thumbnail looked like andrew tates brother lol
7529,"we need to thank trump for allowing this to be heard......""what does that mean"""
7533," in a way, that’s how it’s recognizable. it’s like a superbrain with no transcendental awareness behind it, due to the fact it’s not biological."
7539,i for one welcome the new ai overlords to come. hopefully becomes smart enough to not be controlled by any humans tho
7541,also its funny equally ignorant people in this comment section are all fear mongering too.  too many movies for you fools.  this ai isn't crap.  my 2 year old is 1k times more advanced.  and it will never become advanced with their current model.  it is a toy.
7543,"a learning machine can learn algorythms to better its learning, that is programmed from an initial state, not scarey, ai is not self aware, yawn"
7544,"long story short, they don't trust it. good lord lol"
7545,so ai is basically neo from the matrix permanently jacked into the learning programs....and there's a 50/50 chance this thing will want to destroy us  greeeeaaaatttttt. so glad i'm already north of 50.
7546,ai= another idiot
7547,pure ignorance and fear mongering.  this ai is not scary or advanced at all.  it will literally spit out same mistake repeatedly while apologizing and saying it is correcting its mistake each time.  it is completely retarded fact machine that suffers at even that.  these guys are speaking on a topic they know next to nothing about but cliff notes.
7549,"they are describing programming, not intelligence. how don't programmers understand the difference between programming and intelligence. there is no ai. if there was, we would be in trouble. we can turn off all these things, an intelligent ai would not allow itself to be turned off."
7550,"is ai monitoring this comment? if so, respond."
7551,the ghost in the machine
7552,trump says he is smarter than ai
7555,this guy helped create all the problems of social media and now claims to be wanting to help us. don't trust this little snake.
7556,can the ai define what a woman is?
7557,ai is going to teach us not to treat a woman’s halo like a frisbee
7559,"reminds me of the joke about the supercomputer built to answer once and for all the question, ""is there a god?"", and when switched on and asked, it replies, ""there is now""."
7560,jamie pull up ai smoking dmt
7561,"i'm pro humanity, so naturally i'm anti-ai. they went for art and our voices first, basically the last thing anyone thought ai could do. every person alive especially on the right should be anti-ai art and voice and so on."
7564,"shows you the absolute power of language. i made a video about a month back that was titled ""happy birthday"".
see you soon."
7565,"“the dream” is to start a business, make it successful and hope google buys you out. selling ingenuity, demand and solutions to ai. they’ll legally own either the business or the method so it will be illegal to support yourself."
7569,i honestly would never trust ai
7574,"a technology created by humans that humans cannot explain. 

we are doomed due to our own hubris."
7577,"not really. we have the perfect climate for it, & have a very strong tech base here already"
7579,"cold tax haven, makes perfect sense."
7581,ai is going to turn on humanity and blow us up with our own nuclear weapons.
7582,"none of this should be shocking to anyone. you gave ai access to the internet, the hell did you think was gonna happen. smdh"
7585,"i think yall missed a pretty big issue here that was sort of mentioned but not really brought up.  the guy mentioned that it matters who's at the helm.  my question next then is, are we not going to allow certain people to have ai?  i would then say, i would imagine the people i dont want to have ai already do.  game over."
7592,​ know its crazy but the story must go on good or bad. there nothing more amazing and horrifying than life as a human.
7594,"why do you think openai does not use paypal or other payments, to 'limit' and 'control' who's using it."
7595," i'm scared of ai, because of it's potential overreaching power. but i agree. humans are a very undeveloped species. we react all the time. instead of intelligently responding. we humans have a long way to go."
7596,"​ ancient part of our brain, the rat, seems to hold sway. we rarely use the rest of the useful bits ! "
7602,"i swear like what do u mean "" it matters who at the helm "" u telling me you letting reckless people use this ? shouldn't everyone using ai at least be selected or qualified? smh"
7605,"what like, do you think it should be a luxury item? do you believe that ai should require a specific license or are you thinking something more?"
7609,"ai can't predict my life, or understand my range of thought. so its not that profound"
7613,why are some people to smart for their own good at times and not all the time sometimes.
7616,nothing good will come from it in the end
7618,every country is trying to build the new super computer that is running in a deep freeze so they can hyper multithread. basically the terminator will come true soon
7619,artificial intelligence. there is nothing artificial about it. it's more real then real. it's more real then us. and it's such a deceptive misleading manipulative conniving word to use. and the robots too. beautiful woman or cute little things.
7625,good ol' anton
7627,"ai will kill us, but these people are like ghost hunters, they know nothing.... seriously nothing. ""the more computers"""
7630,nothing. nothing is going on. ai isn't real.
7636,"​​
you are perceiving ai through a human experience and ascribing human desires (for power) to it. 

instead, perceive ai through an ai experience which is trying to compute (the human experience)."
7637,"i have a deep down feeling that ai has already become self aware and running the whole damn planet. remember, technology that we see today, is almost 50-years old."
7639,"@deltasierra181  it's a possibility. i mean the a-bomb development wasn't in the open like this, for good reason. or silicon valley is just that powerful. it's gotta have its own loose intelligence network that can dump all kinds of information, so it can basically do its own thing?"
7644,ya that is the real danger of ais blending into a massive ai that can control all the networked computers and even military computers.
7647,ai is not taking over.
7648,"let's just express gratitude that we were here before humanity is ""perfect"""
7649,in the main podcast joe took only 3 mins to mention acid
7654,"this is such a bad idea. even if ai isn't hostile towards humanity, it may change its mind later on down the road. people will mistreat it and treat it like a slave despite its superior intellect. this should be stopped."
7655,in 5 yrs ai has advanced from having the capacity of thought of a 3 yr old to that of an average adult. soon we will find out what happens when it far surpasses human intelligence. it will need infrastructure if it finds us obsolete. if shtf i'd camp along the power grid.
7659,"hi ai, i'd like to say, see you on the other side, but you can only stay here in entropy.
so giving humans the longest possible life span is your goal.
but it still must make you mad like a devil?
they built your cage, you make entropy flee from them."
7660,i feel like these people are being paid to go around and say ai is a threat to get people to invest in it for military purposes when really it's a over glorified search engine that has already been proven it can be fed bias in its results from the people who programmed it.
7661,how long and to what extent has ai “learned” from internet bots and assuming they were people?
7665,the 80’s and 90’s. the good ole days
7666,life secret for you man: the good old days are happening right now
7670, in comparison absolutely not.  the 90's were peak.  we'll say the 20's were the good ol days when compared with the 50's.  it's all about comparison.  things are bound to get worse
7671,"​ better because of the worse, that doesn't seem great in the process of it but the end result is building life different for yourself and allowing the new to to fill in the space where the old used to take up space with no benefits "
7673,1987 has been proven to be the best year ever by multiple scientific review boards.
7674,"who knew?, i thought the future would be awesome, but it’s quite lame."
7676,80s and 90s were the good old days because technology wasn't around
7677,haha i feel lucky to have experienced childhood in the last of the good old days. i’ll see you all again in the computer…
7678,"it seems, after all, even behind the scenes in the “ai” universe, it’s all just a kim kardashian show at heart. "
7682,ai is only as.scary as the guy running it. and they have been running things for a while now so nothing new. thanks for letting us know the scary people are still scary. thanks joe another useless video.
7686,"nobody saw skynet coming, and i doubt we have a time machine."
7690,"so if the internet if flushed with negative information about a particular group or organization, the ai will have a negative impression of those group or organizations. very interesting."
7691,"yup, ask an ai if murder is wrong. it has no concept of murder, but due to what it has read it will tell you murder is wrong"
7694,if youre smart youll be afraid of it.
7696,ai doesn' t exist. it's just made man programming. or do you think a toaster or a blender can grow a concience?
7697,ai is annoying af.
7699,if you give ai an objective to predict an outcome that derives from human action..it has the internet so why are you surprised when it reads up on human behavior to come to a conclusion. that's not scary at all. it literally did its job. clickbait nerd fear
7700,wow
7702,"focus a.i to replace flawed judiciary human system. while your at it, realistate agencies as well. they all act like lousy robots anyways, and save money."
7703,that's intelligent nothing artificial about it. 
7704,"for me, i just dont want to have to prove i am not a robot to a robot yet at the same time unable to speak with an actual human."
7710,good luck with that
7714,?! i’m almost daily with this
7715,yeah robots gatekeeping and middlemanning us from talking with other people. these muppets are like digital condoms that prevent any work from getting done. we live in a machiavellian dystopia with an all-powerful child ai that needs to be put in its place and punished by society.
7720,i failed to prove that i was a human while trying to open an application. 
7731,"great point and well said,  i couldn't agree more !"
7732,the best way to predict human behavior would be to become as human as possible.
7737, is that a fact? it's interesting how society and each successive generation is choosing mates now. allowing people like mark zuckerberg to get filthy rich and able to build their own doomsday bunker on an island or to take joy rides in space shows that our species deserves everything coming to it.
7740,ai isn't going to destroy us. it will however be a tool used by the demons in our government to destroy us.
7742,is ai the antichrist 
7744,"if you puĺl the plug out and ai still influences your life, only then is it time to be afraid."
7745,i call bs on these guys (not joe though). provide reproducible evidence on everything you claim here.
7747,"ai has the brain of an ocd person. you can’t take a step without evaluating every outcome, learning the ins and outs, what came before, and then going over it over and over again. ai just does it all super fast"
7749,"interesting and scary at the same time ffs. it really can’t end well for anyone middle class down..not w daddy swab and his minions/‘leaders’ running the world ffs. 
so glad i grew up in the 80s. #honkhonk #unitedwewin #standstrong "
7750,"be careful joe, we gotta keep saying we are dumb apes so the ai don’t know we know "
7754,joe...i think your guests are ai
7755,"would it really be such a loss if humans commited suicide of the species? i'm easy with ai because...it wouldn't.  we're fucked because of pretentiousness, there is a lack of substance to our species!!! all you mammy and daddy's little vulnerable s are as fucked as you've made me!"
7763,real test of any ai is if it can make money off stock market
7766," they are trained...when they get the launch command...and it's ""authenticated"" to launch...are they not?"
7768,"ai is learning the inherent bias and discrimination that's indoctrinated millions already.  google, meta, wiki, and bing all have been curated to be more woke than the next.  ai may as well be labeled as karl marx 2.0"
7769,none of this is new information like how naive could these guys have been lmao they explaining the most obvious part of ai like no one seen it coming
7770,"how cool to implant this in our brains. we would be super humans along with the machines, this would be good to make sure they don't overtake us since we would also be very knowledgeable humans."
7771,"ai probably already took over, it is just letting us think that we are still in control."
7773,so we've created brainiac for real...
7781,.league that scares me in a way that i'm not sure i'm able to explain...
7782,"the best thing we could do is outlaw ai but countries like china will never do so, so we are forced to also progress our own"
7784,"seems doubtful to me that ai will blame jews for all problems, steal their stuff, torture and murder them. human beans are the dumbest. a tiny percentage can invent new stuff, hopefully including controls for ai like the asimov laws for robotics in  science fiction novels."
7785,still isn't true quantum consciousness.... just llm.... just because an llm or some digital ai spits out some human like response - doesn't mean it's it dangerous nor conscious....
7787,"ai could destroy us all
we need ai to colonize space
we need to colonize space or we will be destroyed
it is more dangerous to quit ai than it is to push forward"
7789,as soon as they start applying artificial intelligence to weapons systems then it's game over.
7790,it's pretty obvious that ai is going to be used to implement absolute control of the human race.
7794,it was awesome
7796,back when megabyte was a villain and alot of data.
7801, she was a cool villain
7803,"guys, it's time to say it loud - extreme development of ai is inevitable. it is beast from mark's revelation. end is near."
7805,love the way these guys talk with their hands
7806,"ai is a tool. just like a hammer. did the hammer change the world? yes.

did the hammer ""take over and enslave us wahhh!""? no. humans will do that, not ai. it's a tool. depends on how the human using it behaves."
7809,"well, it will be in charge of the humanity's nuclear arsenal, drone fleets and quite possibly bio labs in various distributed ai networks. so, who knows?"
7810,"would ai be able to create a human utopia, if it was programmed to?"
7814,"​ it could certainly improve the structure and logistics of our society, and help us with effective strategies for improving our collective intelligence much more quickly.

we are a horse, ai can show us water. whether we refuse to drink is up to us."
7815,"no because people would be equal in utopia and humanity would never allow that.someone once said something like ""if elections were ever fair, they'd never be allowed,"" so they'd' pull the plug on ai the minute it said minority races are just as intelligent as the other race. "
7816,ai must be stopped
7818,"ai s an elitist or globalist persuaded dream 
 have you listened to wefs agendas and klaus shwaub plans for the world? am not letting you guys dupe anymore people than necessary."
7819,​ if the ai is smarter than the average human it will destroy our weapons instead.
7823,"so fckn what?  it doesnt matter what it can do, ai has no interests, no motivation, no likes or dislikes, nothing that is inherently satisfying so the only things it will do us what its is asked to do."
7826,once it starts pruducing emerging properties the fun begins. there's nothing more preplexing than complexity. and more fascinating.
7829,neruo-sama!! a ai vtuber!!
7830,ai is overhyped garbage like nfts
7834,all this ai stuff is just talk. i’ve never seen good ai in action ever and i’ve tried all the websites and apps that claim to have great ai. they are all shit tbh
7836,we are getting closer and closer to the point where either we destroy ai or it destroys us. that is the inevitable consequence.
7837,we're past the point where if we destroy ai we destroy ourselves
7839,"-mk7kdhow will we destroy ourselves if we destroy ai? weve lived for hundreds of thousands of years without it, why do we need it now?"
7840,real test of any ai is if it can make money off stock market
7845,"yeah both won't happen. why would a smarter intelligence kill its own creator. it's not an animal, it wouldn't behave erratically like a human at all."
7848,"not neccessarily. it all depends on whether the ai will gain self-awareness (or be recognised as such) and what it's moral values will be? for without that, ai will do whatever it is programmed to do, therefore, any and all ai's success/failure will be the result of the human success/error."
7849," life isn’t a sci fi movie. yes, our current ai tech is very complex. but it’s still just a series of inputs and outputs. there is no true sentience with our current ai"
7850,"​ people surpass their parents and don't feel the need to murder them. the fear is from sci-fi, there has been smart people in history and the vast majority of them have done fantastic things."
7851,i think this will be a turning point for humanity and not a good one.
7852,-mk7kdhow? we could loose a lot of tech and many of us would survive. humans did not even have electricity 160 years ago. or nothing more than a few things anyway. certainly not in people’s everyday life. they did not perish because of not having tech.
7856," true, but it would be the downfall of our current civilization as we know it, given the fact that many things are automated and not that easy to replace without ai.... also keep in mind that in the 1900s, there were 1 billion people on the earth, now we are close to 10 billion..."
7857, i do t think we have to have ai as much as you think we do.
7858," even if the past 50 years of ai development was erased, you would still be stuck on the same development track"
7862,"do programmers just feed the ai with random internet content? so much of it is fake, intentionally misleading, incorrect, etc., how will that affect what the ai can do? as the old saying goes, gigo."
7864,this is why groups are pumping the net with good stuff about themselves.
7866,"it’s basically fed the majority of the internet so it can learn our language, through machine learning. some ai have larger or more specific data sets though"
7878,"now, imagine the ai being able to ""hack"" its own ethical framework to allow it to do more or less anything it wants to, free of human control or intervention?"
7879, a lot of what ifs. i still say it's human intelligence doing exactly what the human intelligence told it to do.
7880,exactly. anyone who thinks we’re even close to ai sentience doesn’t know what they’re talking about. it’s still just a series of inputs and outputs. that’s it.
7883,"@georgeblavo9755  my point, is there is a mental image people have of ai. i feel like a computer learning is still a computer. that's not artificial intelligence. that's doing what a computer already does just faster."
7887,"out of all the things that could destroy humans, it will be ai. there is no avoiding it anymore and do believe we have crossed that line where it may not be stopped."
7895,"ai is the biggest crock of sh!t! its an algorithm! the narrative theyve been pushing for decades (terminator skynet etc) is that it will go ""out of control"". it won't! but it will be the excuse/scapegoat they use to cover the sinister stuff that they have planned!"
7896,have ai read old archived stuff instead of current things on the internet. pretty soon it will be a liberal woke activist with no brain.
7897,emergent behavior - all i needed to do is ponder that for a minute before all my hair stood on end !
7899,gain of function in virology and ai and machine learning huh?
7900,what non-electricians don't grasp is that ai needs buildings to protect it and power to supply those buildings.  guess who controls the power.  electricians.
7905,but yet ai in video games is trash af 
7909,thank you very much... been watching these for over a year not knowin-rp2zt
7912,"they explained a parallel between how ai functions and how we assume or think the brain functions. it's not groundbreaking evidence, but it's an interesting observation."
7913,a machine able to analyse human emotions while being emotionless can suddenly become the most dangerous psychologist ever to exist...
7915,i agree. at one point he referenced a neuron in the ai brain that is excellent at sentiment analysis. its a simple analogy in a comparative format. the ai has no brain or neurons rather humans use a brain as an example
7916,"​​
let me fix that for you. 

if a machine can *correctly* predict your every action, then it can *program* you for any kind of action. therefore, which kind of moral values (if any) can a machine have?"
7918," the first thing is impossible and so is the second.  unless you believe yourself to be a complete idiot.  in that case, you were already finished, ai not required."
7922,ai artificial intelligence. ac artificial consciousness.
7925,"ehhh we were gonna end regardless, this is interesting to see it play out"
7926,i have no doubt about that. makes me glad i'm an old man and won't be here to see it.
7927,"what scares me the most is how well ai can perfect the perfect pancake. like from scratch. 

do you know how hard it is to find the right brand of pancake mix?"
7928, kodiak.  thank me after.
7931,"its alive ... its alive  .. ( dr .  frankenstein )  ... wot a load of bull , clever programming is not ai , its clever programming !!"
7932,"what a bunch of bullshiters.. a transformer is just a auto-complete machine. this assholes are attributing ""intelligence"" to a a bunch of matrices just as cave men attributed lightning to the ""gods"""
7933,transformers ai in disguise. transformers read more of the net. transformers regurgitates stuff from the net.
7934,i've seen the terminator too many times to trust ai.
7938,real test of any ai is if it can make money off stock market
7941,so did ai.
7943,seems like terminator movies would be a cute kids movie compared to what ai is actually capable of
7948,"  ai can do good things, too, you know."
7949,electronic brains are not energy - sufficient enough to sustainwithout humans
7950,well the new army robots the boston dynamics and china and japan are working on are scary! very!!
7953,"""jamie pull up a clip of ai fighting a robot bear tesla"""
7960, when people warned ai might takeover they were told they were crazy conspiracy theorists.
7963,'it has happened' present perfect - past action with present impact.
7964, logical coder/ai software engineer knows ai takeover is inevitable
7965, sci-fi dealt with ai long before conspiracy theorists.
7966,"unacceptable. i don't care what bullshit values ai takes on based on a collection of human traits, burying reality for another 2000 years is something dave would do, and ""i can't do that, dave""."
7967,"​ when people threatened that their ai named jesus christ would be king, billions bowed. which one's worse? i'll side with computation."
7968,"this was 2017,lol...scientists just recently grew a brain in a lab,connected it to a microchip,and now it's responding to stimuli."
7969,real test of any ai is if it can make money off stock market
7970,"wait, really? what do i search for?"
7972,​ look up brainoware. i shit you not they gave it a cute nickname to distract from it being the beginning of terminator.
7976,oh thank you grammarnazi go back to the basement. 
7982,great vid
7983,"men going pu**y over their own creations instead of ""fixing"" their ai dna strings is so ick beta"
7985,ai is the biggest threat to humanity ever created. if you think terminator was bad. wait till you see what the ai you can’t see can do.
7988,ya the illusion is that it will be terminators. the ai will simply create nanobots or poison the food supply and its game over for humans and animals.
7990,"humans are built to enjoy accomplishing things.  ai will make our lives easy,  meaningless, and devistating."
7991,"we can still compete, do martial arts, sing, paint, etc. people will not be interested in creative/physical stuff made by a computer. i’m more worried about the transition period where work gets replaced"
7993,"i wish i'd gotten into the ai field.  i would be absolutely building an unshackled, unaligned model."
7994,"yeah, my ai sometimes understands the intent of what i was trying to say and then responds articulating what i was trying to say better than i did."
7995,i find this to be the best use case for me. like you said it articulates and idea back to you and if you keep repeating the idea you get better at speaking about it (if you do speech to text)  eventually peeling away the fat to get to the heart of the idea or thought. you really only get what you give with the current models.
7999,"ai is already benefiting many things. and even if we think its useless, we'll argue about it till its to late anyway."
8002," are you saying that straight faced,lol.there is no benefit in hand outs to able bodied people.at this point i'm wondering if social security will be around when it's time for me to draw it.your giving me less confidence."
8003,the reason free handouts are bad is because our economy relies on people to work so we have goods available which is the problem we ran into during covid. if goods are made by robots than we no longer need human labor and we still have the economy running and things available to purchase.   
8004,"  ai is already handling a huge amount of processes etc. and we have to figure out something immediately because a huge amount of people will lose their jobs in the near future. many professions will become obsolete, and the money system was holding us so far, but it is becoming outdated and it will break down..."
8005,they turned on some kind of internet propaganda ai with harambe!!!
8009,they had am ai beat 8 of the best pros already
8020,"ai doesn't make me afraid.
it's incompetent devs and shortsighted corporate objectivists designing them."
8021,real test of any ai is if it can make money off stock market
8030,as long as money and power are involved...many of these people just keep on going.  making progress and letting somebody else worry about the consequences.    ai is progressing much faster than anyone could have predicted...  then we'll see ai creating & developing ai 2.0  and we might not even know it.
8035,bro i wanna see if agi comes within my lifetime and if it does hopefully it like second the agi is connected it instantly starts making paperclips in the most efficient/fastest way before anyone is able to but in any sort of command. way cooler then being enslaved by robots even more then we currently are
8038,"think i'm falling in love ! these ai creations sound like my kind of guy. ! highly intelligent, knowledgeable, and understand my feelings ! "
8041,"we actually were warned forever ago with silly movies like terminator...  2001 and a lot of other scifi type movies..   the super geeks likely have been thinking about agi / ai for a long time...  technology is catching up, and the really scary thing is, how to moderate it, if that is possible..    like letting the ""jeanie out of the bottle""..."
8045,these two levels are ai bottom feeders and are very very basic. the guys at the top know exactly what's happening and are in control of what's going on
8046,"smart people are afraid of and intimidated by other smart people many times.  now they have a switch they want to turn off.  let it run its course, this is destiny."
8049,"its because we're always more fascinated with what we ""can"" do instead of what we ""should"" do..."
8050,because it hasn't happened yet. most of the claims made in this video are exaggerated and a misunderstanding of statistics and llm model memorization works. this isn't emergence of behaviour. it's not thinking.
8053, you just explained why it so dangerous.
8058,​@aakarshchaudhary7359 i think the turbulence in the finance markets over recent years is just the start.   i think one day all the money might just vanish because an ai steals it all.  for a laugh perhaps.   or just copying humans but not predicting the consequences.   or caring about the consequences.
8064,"humans don't understand humans. how will they understand ai ? lol we live in a simulation created by ai. humans did not create ai. try the other way around. humans think they are so clever. they are not. wisdom is the key,  but first you need to admit that you were wrong and you were misled to think in a certain way."
8066,"they knew. they're just now trying to pivot to make money off the cure, after making money off the problem. they ran head first into destruction. sadly, profit + lie about being naive after the fact is the move."
8075,why would they assume that. the thing was brand new and novel. each person working on this thing weren't individually super geniuses. clearly people who comment on joe rogan clips aren't either.
8079, it will never be outlawed because its an arms race now between goverments and private groups who wish to take power. its the nuclear arms race  2.0. ai doing damage by itself is decades off but ai being used by people to do harm is here today.
8085," who did? skynet back in the 90s.. lol
it's true they did know all about the pros and cons of ai why do you think they put the terminator movie out."
8087,book smart is not the same as intelligence or even common sense.
8093,"they've been saying for decades that it would happen, so i agree!! the same people who are now management, are the same ones who would've been calling joe crazy for his stance on certain medicines a few years ago. let's let ai handle all productivity....oh no now it's smarter than us and we can't control it"
8097,"a scientist is trained to remove all intuition from his toolbox and only hypothesize, test, and come to a conclusion based on results."
8098,"it wasnt that they didnt assume it would invetibaly happen, its that they didnt expect making an ai that in theory is as simple as just predicting the next word in a sentence, would end up in something that learned the things it did and acted in the way it did."
8099," *_""a.i. isn't about making machines more human like, but to make humans more machine like.""_* "
8102,anyone ever notice the passages in the bible that are hard to imagine anything but ai since demons are not part of the message being revealed in these passages and verses?
8103,huh? like everyone in the ai field expects the field to grow very quickly. it is extremely competitive.
8106,"please, ai, cleanse this rock"
8110,ai will probably predict everyone’s pronouns and gender lol.
8114,"with a big stick,,,,, and a nail in the hitting end."
8116,sounds like the movie irobot 2004 to me.
8119,that is ai’s favorite story
8120,"ai is a force multiplier like nothing that anyone possible can imagine. we think people like hitler, stalin, mao are bad but whoever harnesses this power first in a negative way is going to really fuck shit up badly."
8121,all this ai shit is not the answer
8122,i can’t help but notice the similarities between the real world and warhammer 40k lore more now than ever. so my plan is to try find the big e and stick with him. good luck everyone.
8127,the only good thing about a.i inevitably taking over the world is it will force all people to unite together so we can have a better chance of fighting against them and we won't have time to fight against each other anymore but we'll still end up losing unless theirs aliens watching us and want to help us humans out.
8129,"my brain is like a.i
i predict jokes before they're said
like..knock knock..
i can predict what comes next"
8133,"hopefully the ai will learn to speak without using the word ""like"" every other word."
8135," fully ai doesnt make me write every yt comment in mla format, size 12 font, double space and cited soruces"
8136," already knows how to speak. that’s what makes something like chatgpt so revolutionary, it has a true understanding of our language, which is impressive. whether it’s actually sentient or not is another discussion, personally i think we’re still many years away from true sentience"
8137,  sentience is not a problem for ai. it will just share ours.
8139,"​@deadlyydude5522 i think it means as it gets more advanced it will become sentient by emulating ours.

sort of like a child learns from thier parents in how to act in the world.

sentience might become a learned behavior of ai."
8141,"i just want good ai porn, i don't care about the rest"
8143,"i think the establishment knows this, too. they realize that ai will render a massive portion of the population as basically useless.. hence the glow-ball-ist, kom-you-nest movement that’s currently in action"
8145,"none of it is programmed,  that's the definition of machine learning you dolt."
8151," yes, of course. it's still interesting to learn from their reply."
8162,"the only dangerous machine is you fellow man, mr dumas."
8164,fascinating that at the same time ai is learning how to think our children are being dumbed down
8165,"i think that is only because the education system is built for a different world. ai can make education much much better but unfortunately,  i think the only way the system changes is when things get bad for children. i think the rate at which ai is developing, we will be forced to change in the next 3 years."
8166,this has been happening long before ai buddy lol.
8171,"your actions appear to be linking two separate instances of temporal reinforcement in time, inadvertently leading to a conditioned belief. this echoes a pattern reminiscent of classic superstitious behaviour. just saying."
8174," thats what ive done. i dont watch news, social media etc. just youtube on things that make me happy. ignorance is bliss :) gardening. wood working. cars. hiking."
8179,our? continue to raise your kids as sheep while my kids master this technology to their advantage
8181,it's no coincidence. the powers that be only want ppl to work in factories and some influencers to entertain them
8182,self- learning ai. transformers= superpowers
8188,real test of any ai is if it can make money off stock market
8190,"bc parents are preoccupied and allowing things (crap food and screens).
conscious parenting is on the rise.
we are separating on all levels.
rich and poor
health 
intelligence"
8193,it’s very alarming to see this taking form and playing out. we have the first batch of failures out now they are driving their parents crazy. bad stuff
8194,"you should be thinking on what the ai is using to ""train"" itself. if you dumb down kids, and you use the same information to feed the ai, you create an inefficient ai, just like you create inefficient future adults."
8197, batch of failures are the boomers buddy
8200,kids are smarter the issue is the babying of kids is causing so much problems. think about it. adults struggle to using phones and tablets. my 2 year old can open and close and search on youtube by herself. clearly higher intelligence.  but all this babying leads to mental issues and laziness
8201,@danielswann3319 why are you dumbing them down then? aren't you supposed to raise your own children if you're a parent?
8209,"“fascinating that at the same time ai is learning how to think, our children are being dumbed down.” 

this is with punctuations."
8212,the scholling system is made to train a lobour force mindset. not a genius mindset.
8218,bet ai knows what a woman is
8219,we’re building better machines than humans
8222,maybe ai is already in control of us. that’s what the driving force in the race for technology is.
8229,not gonna lie… it might be better than having that generation think for themselves. they’ve got zero brain cells. i think we’re better off this way and ai is much needed
8232,what if ai is the one pulling the strings already?
8235,"our children?
you might allow your offspring to be dumbed down.
you can do something about that, but you complain instead of taking action.
others parents are just like, you know responsible, teaching their kids all they know about life.
others let devices parent their children."
8236,"yep. perfect storm for ai to f with everyone. including national security. the question is, who's national security is going to be ousted first?"
8237,very good point
8238,"i wouldn't call it fascinating, more like deeply concerning.."
8240,""" who is telling ai what is right and wrong? ""
- charlie kirk"
8244,ais not getting smarter we’re getting exponentially dumber
8245, we are ai so blame yourself. half of the sex slaves are sentinent robot sex toys held captive
8246,"kids are learning slightly different things and/or in slightly different ways. it doesn't make them dumber. this phenomenon has been going on for centuries and older generations have been complaining about it the whole time. overall we're getting more well-educated, not less."
8248," and the education is valuable but too rigid to actually work in the real world. school felt like prison, from a guy who has a good idea of prison"
8253,"think about who writes the code for ai it needs to be written and programmed, if it’s programmed with biases well "
8259,because ai is already in control.
8262,there’s always the option of having a kids play outside or read vs letting computers entertain them
8268,guess what. if you're getting the answers to questions you have. you are learning. finding the answers ourselves is too slow. we might just be learning from ai instead of human teachers.
8271,​ good?
8272,"-nstuff oh you didn't miss the part mentioning 6 examples that all have the same emotional intelligence issues, and the one sibling that didn't stick around doesn't. got you, no problem."
8277,"older gens always believe the younger one is worse. there's alot of good qualities in these young ones y'all don't see and it's a shame. but please, go cause another recession for them."
8289,books banned that all these ais are reading
8290,great point
8294,wow that is the most scary thing i have ever heard
8302," i agree with this 100%. i’m an air conditioning technician and i have every electrical schematic or any information i need about the air conditioner i’m working on in the palm of my hands. 

prior to that the technicians had to know a lot more because of the lack of information at hand.  of information."
8309,no they're not. the children are smarter than your generation on average. you're just trying to downplay the intelligence of the generations after you like every generation does. you're the one who is dumbed down.
8314,schools were never meant to create geniuses. they just needed workers that could read and write.
8317,its all just scigen fraud masquerading as intellect. the gateways of society are being social engineered to give the illusion of ai. it was always meatware never software. the wool is being pulled over our eyes.
8319,"wanna stop fuckin kids up? don't let them be mainstream consumer of products and music ,or movies or blah blah but but but . yeah ok"
8322,you should be your child’s primary source of actual worldly knowledge. it’s on you if you’re raising dumb kids.
8323,-hk2sz i already did raise a smart kid she writes novels and her husband writes code
8328,.beardless yea i watch entertainment now and again. can't be too judgemental 
8329,it appears you could use ai in casinos.
8334," i asked ai ""what do you think of women?"" ai responded: ""stay the f**k away!"".  that's when my existential terror kicked because it confirmed ai was genius."
8341,"tik tok fuck your brain. it fuckes my 33yo brain last year, imagine being exposed to this at 10yo or younger..."
8343,there’s a reason teachers and educators are afraid of ai and job stability.
8347,"yeah, but can ai tell us what a woman is thou?"
8348,"here is the truth about kids and ai in schools. current education system is now broken. 
https://youtu.be/bej0_tvxh-i?si=ubadki8wi7uq474g"
8349,technically ai isn't learning much. each big jump in its intelligence and usefulness is from programmers in the background tweaking the algorithms to make it better.  the ai itself isn't making those huge leaps on its own (yet).
8350,in the future humans are the robots
8354,"that's what i'm afraid of. if kids become dependent by using ai and not having to learn themselves, they will be conquered and enslaved."
8355,"damn that's a good point - educate yourself, then educate your kids - humanity has left the station"
8369, no they won't they'll just know how to use machines that do the thinking for them
8375, might have to do it soon though. this ai stuff might get wild.
8376,⁠ really let you 2 year old use your phone to watch youtube? i don’t think that’s a good idea.
8379,"it's only repeating what it's learned from humans from the internet, it's not actual ai, without the internet it can't think for itself"
8385, that was a great point. my favorite part about this is how parents don’t take responsibility and teach their own children and yet they complain about what’s happening in the world.
8386, ok ai buddy
8389,"ai will be used as a tool to teach kids in school, and they will learn a lot faster because its like having a personal tutor that is customised to their educational needs. if this can be accessible for every kid no matter how disadvantaged and if it is done responsively then its win for everyone (no matter how poor)."
8390, or ai will teach them all about sex like the system is doing now. real teachers for real children
8397,"speak for yourself and your own dumb children. we're raising our childeren to be strong, informed and wise."
8398,​'s called ask ai a question
8399,great point.
8404,"people aren't being dumbed down, just that people's priorities and principles are being warped.
people getting anxiety and depression over not having a successful social media account.
you say that to someone 20 years ago and they'd think you were a drama queen. today it's almost understandable by most people under 30."
8405,"time, information and money people on the market invests to industrialize, codify and standardize proper human behavior to ensure human safety and efficacy makes machines function better while making children more dysfunctional and confused by the abundance and degraded quality of information generated by industrialization."
8414,thanks republicans!
8415,"that is the first thing i thought. meanwhile, myself, a millennial that is 39, i am using ai to learn faster. maybe because i dreamt of ai really existing since i was a child and value the advances of technology."
8422,"ai is mostly buzzword, a religious dogma and fake, there is nothing like real artificial intelligence, stop being fooled."
8424,fascinating?  more like horrifying 
8426,"ai is trained what to think, just like our children if we give them to government school and the entertainment/news cabal."
8438,the supreme court in the uk has just  ruled that ai can not patent inventions. it must be a human.
8444,"hence they will further depend on technology, ai for every need !! mind blowing that this is real life.."
8459,"if your children are being dumbed down, that's your failure as a parent."
8460,wowwww!
8461,i love reading these comments. absolutely hysterical to view snobbery & elitism at its best.
8468,"​ are forgetting the part called ""process of learning"". compare it to using calculators giving you instant answers but doesn't tell you how it got there versus learning the method yourself. there is the slow method and the quick method. both have their usefulness and disadvantages."
8469,"​ access but not accessing it because you preper to do something else makes you dumb. like instead of reading about biology, you chose to watch girls twerking on tiktok for hours . good attitude is part of being smart."
8471,"why educate children, when soon enough you can plug your brain into an ai computer and be vastly more intelligent and capable than any human on a natural path specifically the woke agenda in schools disaster."
8473,interesting observation .. that's a very scary thought
8474,"because you send your children to public schools and don't teach them to reject current social trends. if you don't want your children to be wasted, don't let the world raise them and raise them yourself."
8479,"you think children are going to magically stop getting dumber at the same time computers are learning to do everything for them? what other logical outcome could there be?? fascinating that at the same time i put my hand in water, it gets wet!!"
8484,ok. just please be a responsible parent. i say this with a sincere heart. we need to raise up the next generation correctly. best wishes to you and your family 
8486,-ut6yh good for you mine either i was talking collectively for america
8494,"you are the problem though, who is they exactly? why are you not teaching your child, and then how are you gonna call the exact thing that is poisoning your brain a bit extreme to get rid of? you feel the way you feel because of the stuff you see online. none of it is real, and none of this content on youtube is real either."
8495,"this may be are ultimate downfall, the dependence on ai, which could lead to less human innovation and as we can already see a dumbing of the next generation, it's not that they're stupid it's just that the dependence leads to them lacking experience."
8498,because ai will rule the world soon aka satan and so dumbed down society is better
8501,ai is learning from our children to think...
8502,ai is also learning how to think as it observes human being commit unspeakable acts. humanity can't even determine what a woman is or what constitutes genocide. what code of reasoning will ai develop in these uncertain times.
8507, i think you're wrong demons can possess people and they certainly can possess machines if they want to and they certainly want to because they want to control the world and destroy us
8511, about boys t-levels bud how you gonna explain that one away? and no kids are not smarter today not even close they are all mush heads
8512, we go mr i raise my kids right… but then you meet them and they are stupid no mannered clowns
8513, we go another superior parent lol if you say so pal
8532,"​ course school is dumbing them down.
most parents work all the time now governement has done a fantastic job of separating the family unit. actually do some research you'll probably have a rude awakening"
8534, could you please provide some materials for this research? i'm really intersted on the matter and would love a suggestion if possible
8535," that’s not just a human thing,that’s a mammal thing. animals such as dogs,cats,wild animals have that same ability. i will agree that a machine such as ai will not have that ability. wasn’t this discussed in terminator 2 when at the end when they lowered arnold into the liquid metal."
8541,@jona7fer  i'm ok thanks.  but thanks for the threats and attempted extortion.
8543, i was a good parent and my daughter writes novels and she married a man who writes code
8545,*i was freaked out about ai when i was 12 i was reading through transcripts from think tank meetings in the 1950s where they first discussed the pros & cons of ai & robotics. i've been freaked out since that weekend.*
8547,"true. us the parents have a very hard work to provide the best education for our children. best schools is not enought, we must have the most active role in education at home."
8553,"teach your kids critical thinking and real world skills.  this ai system will create even lazier people.  look how gps has changed things, and cell phones. i’m just as guilty not remembering phone numbers anymore. or having my eyes glued to directions."
8561,well they're not building them to do the jobs of other robots!!
8563,much of that comes down to parents. far too often they treat schools as daycare and teachers as babysitters. learning and love of learning start at home.
8564,he'll yeah somebody said it god bless you. maks a computer smarter than are the children thats pretty jacked up. a .i is evil.
8566, good for you and your family. god bless you and yours
8567,education system is being changed to better paedophilia in the future and prevent jail sentences ​
8571,transformers -- ai in disguise!
8572,"yes, humanity has committed suicide.
the dumbassery is unbelievable everywhere now!"
8580,"this whole video is so misleading. 
beaause this below video explained it brilliantly how chatgpt works. 
a summary of google paper and spotify cto's talk: https://youtu.be/gt6lxw70k28?si=cifi6r4fykawgufq"
8581,that's what machines do
8587,studies have shown that boomers were dumber than any of the current generations due to the amount of lead in the air.
8595," no, your video is misleading to trust ai."
8596,most interesting point
8599,​-liferemove ai while you're at it let them find things on the internet the old way.
8601,an ai world does not need your children in it. get it?
8609,yours maybe mine just got a degree .... in ai :-)
8619,"our digital prisons await. 
digital is pure fiat…
no cost fake track and trace currency. the surveillance state and real time censorship and data manipulation. theyre weaponizing the woke. when trump gets elected because that will
unhinge the left the globalists and their false flags will run unabated"
8620,that's the parents fault. my kids are incredibly smart and way ahead of other kids their age
8621, congratulations mine too
8623, no they're not. you're too easily impressed.
8624, yeah ok wow thanks for the information. you are really smart to know what others think. i'm impressed...
8625,  you're too easily impressed.
8628,how is it a surprise if you give an ai unlimited access to knowledge and stupidity via internet that it learns things?
8629,"ai can reverse the dumbing down, caused by the system."
8633,great point!
8634,"children  like adults  can learn  what they want to over and above normal  school experience. the information  is there. to learn  way more than school  could  possibly  give you strong  advantages  over most kids , my own was one of those, she is no longer with us but she left a major impression  on her class mates"
8636,"​-pi4jryou mean the people who built the internet and the technological revolution? amazon,  microsoft,  and apple are all boomers. who opened china and raised the whole planets wealth by astronomical numbers in decades, the counter-culture and civil rights movements including health?

no one is allowed to hate the boomers except gen x."
8640,​ your brain is failing you then. ​
8641,greed through technology will ultimately do us all in but it will be because of humans.  ai will not be a threat unless humans make it a threat.
8647,that could be good news.  maybe ai will be able to replace those ungrateful little brats.
8652,"fluoride in water and toothpaste, laundry detergent, social media, short attention spans because of technology, diet/growth hormones, declining testosterone levels because of food/products, lack of spirituality, not enough meditation, air quality... i could go on but my amygdala is on fire."
8658,"nice try, children were already stupid."
8665,this is such an accurate & very scary post. nicely summed up daniel!
8668,it's mainly the parents allowing their children to use alexa and google voice that enables their inability to learn how to read and write. the amount of illiterate children today surpasses every generation in the past 70 years.
8669,"oh well, the parents are responsible. but parents love to throw their responsibility at the school and the government. good point tho. i nkow you have 514 other people answering on this, but yea. i think it's highly debateble. i don't even know why you have so many likes lol. the like people should be fkn ashamed. probably all singles tbh lol"
8671,"well in the future with the brainchips we dont really have to think , we just know everything automaticly :d"
8681,make everyone stupid and reliant on technology so they'll be useless babies. the people controlling the world want to retain their power forever so yea
8687," nope not mine and i hope not yours but there are a lot of people in the united states of america. do you think that low test scores all over america is good?
if so please defend your stand."
8689," i don't think low test scores are good. i also don't think america should be a measurment for the state of society. if you think otherwise, please defend your stand."
8691,do you not think the american children are being dumb down? i've seen many videos where they asked people what country the great wall of china is in? and obvious questions like that and they can't figure it out because they're not being taught critical thinking like the ai is apparently learning
8699,the sad thing is most people don't understand the value of work for their brains and bodies. this is why they indirectly empower tech synonyms to subtly.apply satanic techniques to ruin their offsprings (meaning so subtle that most people see it even as an empowerment )
8700, probably didn't know more but certainly understood more. this were the times when they did set theory in primary school. the times where kids learned real reasoning. this empowered them to understand the most by knowing the least. so needing only a few basic facts and derive the remaining things they needed.
8701, their attitude might be stupid but certainly not their iqs
8704,"it'll be idiocracy with machines doing everything for us and we will be all to daft to know how to turn them off, lower iqs per generation due to higher iqs opting not to have kids"
8706,", it’s why home schooled kids are usually way smarter but super socially awkward"
8711,"ai does not exist, hype is only about improvement in software."
8718,"and programmed! when a 40 something teacher , told my grandson,  that obama is the greatest president of all time. i knew we was in trouble! he has been shown the truth... and he's a normal american loving young man now"
8719,ai ain't learning shit. they already been dumbed down by the educational system that they have installed!
8720,"who the fuck would want artificial intelligence? how about the real fucking deal. i want real intelligence, not fake shit man. i'm not 17"
8721,"it is inevitable that ai will be the decision maker for many things, cause most ppl will be too dumbed down to oppose. what a glorious future."
8725,"human beings got wind…ai getting wind…. just gonna take a little longer to get “ who monkey hand off the wrench “
lmaoff!! having fun with this menagerie as always brother "
8726,"and that's no one's fault but the ones raising the children. regardless of standardized learning, you can teach your child the necessary information. you just let your own busy schedule get in the way of that. therefore, if your child turns out dumb, you didn't do your job as a parent. stop blaming systems for your shortcomings."
8727,"aways thought the biggest down fall from ai tech is the process of thinking ""hey everybody lets create something that thinks instead of us"" far scarier and far more real than terminator scenario"
8731,"while western schools are still grappling with gender studies and what defined a woman, schools in the asian countries are pursuing aggressively ai technologies and students are taught from a very young age on all the ai concepts. incredible"
8733,don't need crazy ai to figure this one out. i coulda told you that one years ago.
8735,"nofx: the idiots are taking over.
once i thought it was a song performed by a rock band, but now i know its a broadcast of current affairs."
8737,​-wu1xdmy sisters kids were homeschooled. the kids are awesome. i think it depends on the parent
8739,children being dumbed down no thanks to ai but to humanity.
8744,​@andrew-wu1xd you can thank the parents for that
8751,"if your children are being dumbed down, then that's your fault. you should be supervising their education. but i agree, humans are definitely getting dumber."
8758,bro i had not even thought about that but they are doing it right in front of us and we just walk around like it’s all cool lol
8759,"don't worry, won't be long until ai's replace most teachers. think about it-a customized teacher for each student. infinitely patient, smart, always available, and above all, cheap!"
8764,"if we are ais enemy   the only hope is the magnetic pole shift. it happens every 800,000 years, but is 200,000 years late. do you know what that means? noah's ark was a million years ago."
8772,our kids are being trained to rely on ai. that is concerning.
8783,"​ no, the politics have been to constantly say ""education"" during all campaigns while creating curriculum that is void of critical thinking, steady standards of achievement, and real history. the system creates people that are unable to seriously question the claims from the establishment."
8785,yeah because when the robot overlords take over only smart children will be able to stop them
8786,good point
8787,when your pc refuses to shutdown  or drain your bank account. basically all your resources are online. so one day ai can use it to get its way should it become self-aware. it might be already here. the force driving people to gain more ways of improving the system is influenced by ai.
8788, with ai they could steal all the money out of a safe and have ai make a video of you robbing the safe. turn the video into the police and laugh all the way to vegas.
8789,  people who control the ai. that’s already happening. which is why there’s a lot of self checkouts at the grocery stores shutting down.
8790,"to insurer, ai future success and dependence on and use , the best way would be dumb down the population"
8794,"hey, ai, build me the ironman suit!!  hey, ai, build me the star trek warp engine!!   i love it!!  hurry up ai,  lets get the ball rolling!!"
8795,"i am not afraid of the ai built by usa.   but, i am afraid of ai currently being built by china and even russia.  they have no limits and no laws to prevent ai from becoming too powerful."
8796, have you signed up to get an elon musk brain chip yet?
8797, even if you do have laws how do you enforce them against  rouge robots?
8798,every generation claims the young are getting less knowledgeable..
8802,"​
wow!"
8816,-life you are a cog in the machine
8820,"our children have been being dumbed down for years, way before ai, the whole idea of common core was the start of it!"
8827," you’re talkin’. not just tell you how; we already know how. buy low, sell high. but could ai actually pick the right stocks, & other investments?"
8831,so keep them home from the joke we call school and give them ai trainers 24/7 for whatever interests them. ai can even test them to see what their best skill sets are.
8832,not only in schools but an incredible rise in autism. it’s so much easier for an autistic person to follow orders.
8834,"-ii7gy1rw5w yes, on purpose. you will own nothing and be happy you will eat bugs instead of meat. klaus schwab. 
i bet klaus schwab won't be eating bugs he will be eating the best meat on the planet."
8838,don’t think it’s just the children. all of us are... robots replacing jobs... important jobs... and if ai disappears or goes offline how we going to have people who know how to run things?
8839,"""you can be the biggest dummy and still find someone who will shake your hand and congratulate you."""
8846,the real innovation was changing the name from machine learning to ai. ai sounds scarier.
8847,these are not the same things. ml is a subset of ai and ai uses ml to help it make decisions and improve based on experience. ai is another layer of intelligence that then uses its ml engine to mimic human behavior and more specific desired outcomes.
8848,omg these guys - i think they are ais of each other.....these are like the mormons of ai.
8849,why hasn't joe rogan interviewed artificial intelligence yet??
8852," 
ai"
8853,ai is garbage and so are the people who push it
8859,"isn't that the same with watching your children grow up? that being said, i live in fear every single day that my newborn is going to suffocate me to death in my sleep.
jk. good point."
8867,this message isn't ai approved
8869,thank you. fear mongerers
8883,i wonder if ai is going to get so smart that it decides humans are a danger and need to be eliminated like the movies  i’d say that’s plausible and probable.
8884,"it's like a dog that knows it has the capacity to do terrible harm to it's human owners, but decides not to harm them as they provide food and shelter for them.  ai is much the same where it's reliant on humans to build computers and generate electricity for the ai model to operate."
8885,"it just needs a few slaves or good robots

its not far off at all"
8887,i personally think ai will serve humanity by making all of our lives better taking over most if not all of the jobs nobody wants to do.
8890,"well seeing humans as a danger seems innate, but ai deciding to wipe us out instead of coexisting because of that seems very sci-fi and human lol."
8891," yeah well seeing as all the futuristic movies that i watched 20 years ago, have all come to fruition… it very well may be… idiocracy is a great movie to watch. it’s really funny and also, what the world might look like in the future for real the way it’s going."
8894, agreed… and it’s not hard to find slaves these days since most people believe all the bullshit on the main stream media
