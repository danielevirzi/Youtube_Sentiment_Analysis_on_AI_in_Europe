0,very interesting bloke. good stuff .
7,and human history of civilization can be thought of aspiring perfectly fair world (utopia)
9,"the main takeaway from this discussion is that just because somebody has glasses and an accent, that doesn't mean they're not an idiot with no idea what they're talking about."
10,"god, i just love seeing two re*ards talking like they actually know things =)"
20,unstopable us is the anchoring of the truth that the international jew is positioning the eternal take over and wanting people to accept life being unfair.
27,it’s naive to say the gaza war is just about having different ideas of god. there’s a 100 year complex geopolitical history there
31,"nice gentleman but naive, we do fight for material crap, and one of the reasons for the genocide in gaza (and overall apartheid in israel) is the natural resources like oil and water. god, is the fairytale man made tool to make soldiers and fools kill each other over those material things."
32,seeing a white man not speaking perfect english is kinda weird.
38,the thumbnail looks like stephen is breathing fire. 
41,fascinating!  thank you!  i want to hear him more.  where can i find him?
43,i concur with the stance that stephen takes on ai.
44,stephen's eyes started watering after yuval's final statement.  perfect ending to a whirlwind conversation atypical of what yuval typically engages in.
47,i can detect something let’s say “not nice” coming from stephen …
51,harari's insights into technology and humanity are always thought-provoking. great interview!
61,colbert is stupid. he should be afraid.
67,wow! fantastic interview. the ending made me tear up.
69,the fact you people praise this lunatic is astonishing.
71,"yuval is one of the greatest human  thinkers walking this planet in 2024.  colbert, he needs to be interviewed for an extended interview like the one stephen did with paul simon’s."
74,"that was very naive of stephen. i'm surprised, hopefully it was just a setup for harari to deliver his point."
75,"if ai is ""just an extension of us"", why would colbert expect it to do any better than humans have done in history?"
77,nice
78,this guy is the villain in every movie. god help us. this guy and people like him want humans to go extinct
82,"colbert:
humans handled history = not great
ai = extensions of humans

also colbert:
ready for ai to tell us what to do"
88,thanks.
91,"he's wrong about ai. it's not creating new ideas. it's mixing up all the things we already value and then we decide if it's a new idea. ai at this point does not have the ability to recognise an idea or some new concept. true agi, when it happens, will be fundamental in stopping humans from using rampaging ai against other humans."
96,the hooked nose demons fear the artificial intelligence takeover
97,"""2084: artificial intelligence and the future of humanity"" by dr. john c. lennox ... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvf_n6cnp8s"
101,"""i'm ready for the big machines that make big decisions programmed by fellas with compassion and vision."". man. i know he's a comedian but that statement gave me the creeps."
102,"this guy thinks that humans are ""hackable animals"". life is not ai. life is about human consciousness. this guy does not believe in soul. he is part of wef and an evil campaign to dull the human intellect even further by an obsession with ai."
103,"love what he says , it makes me hate him."
106,this guy again.
107,"colbert's blindness displayed again. ""compassion and vision"" that is not what will be used."
108,great guest. love yuval. more of these great minds on the show!! we need voices of reason to guide us
123,yuval talking to a mental midget. show does not deserve this incredible intellect. love yuval
124,"i was enjoying this until yuval (inevitably, sadly) started his pr pitch for israel.  israel v. palestinians not about ideas.  israel just wants that land.  harari is brilliant, but when it comes to israel, he can't get out of his nationalistic (racial?) fog."
131,so glad to hear an aetheist message explaining the absurdities of religion. but curious whether some people will be offended by his comment?
136,noah harai is a complete clown.
138,couple of snakes in human clothing...and the brain dead audience claps. reptiles!!!
139,i’ve been in a room with both of these guys - one in antwerp and one in new york. so cool to see them together!
146,ah this wasn’t a good interview. stephen came off defensive and talked too much. i wish he let him speak more…
161,"steven is right ai cannot produce new ideas, synthetic thought is still the domain of humans alone. whether agi will ever exist remains to be seen."
162,i'm so happy colbert isn't a leader. he's not even funny anymore.
164,only people scared of ai are those who used to be called the smartest people and now they are not smart anymore.
165,“im ready for the machines to tell us what to do” what the actual fuck?
166,ai will be the death of us
168,"this guy is fucking evil, people need to read more about what he thinks humanity is and should become. godless transhumanist nonsense. scary that he's being mainstreamed."
172,love mr. harari
182,i love it when zionists talk about humanity until it comes to palestinian rights .. then all of a sudden humanity gets forgotten… hypocrites
183,"amazing. the level of ignorance of colbert. ""they are extensions of us"", ""they are like us"". my god, he has not an ounce of critical thinking. of course he is a famous."
197,great ai setup mr colbert!
204,how did this incredible guy only get a 7 minute segment - he’s amazing 
208,so mainstrrean ho colbert is advocating something he dont understand while all the experts say its dangerous . we are fkced
211,"humans need to be taught how to handle their emotions, how to communicate with others, and how to maintain and build friendships and other relationships. we are social animals, and these skills should be the number one priority of the school system, but they aren't. ai won't change that priority, but ai might help with teaching it."
212,"yuval harari is an israeli who represents the point of view of about half of the israeli people, who hopes for peace with the palestinians, and all of it’s neighbors. he just happens to be the only one who is famous. 
god bless israel!!! "
214,stephen's lackadaisical view of ai reveals a startling lack of understanding and imagination.
216,may be ai will decide that socialism is the best way to go - a new idea
217,not afraid of robots taking over? how about the terminator?
218,watch his lex fridman interview! he is amazing
219,wow no one is talking about the pen that fell on the ground
220,"thesamuelkay 3d
and if stephen really thought about that... he'd also be an atheist. gervais tried too. very hard for people to overcome personal delusions"
221,this guy is not that bright . have fun eating your organic robot chicken.
222,ai had the potential to be the existential threat humanity has faced throughout history and what we will potentially ever face.
227,"yes, it's an extention of us. so, there's always a person behind the machine. he's willing (and he's trying to convince the public ) to do what the machine tells him to do. a machine with a person behind."
229,"yuval noah harari......i may have to remember that name; that explaination he gave at the end about how to solve conflict.....it kinda resonates with me, i actually dig it!"
230,"the top think tank for the globalist cabal who want you to ""own nothing and be happy"" and live on a diet of bugs in a 15 minute open air prison."
235,"the reason to why stephen isn't concerned, is that he is thoroughly catholic. one of the reasons to catholicism historically being so powerful, is their psychological tricks to teach entire populations to have faith instead of a clear view of reality - and therefore ever having a chance of becoming powerful and mature."
237,"sc - bashes human efforts to date, but then turns around and praises ""compassionate robots"" because they are ""extensions of ourselves""."
241,ai? my students have literally stopped thinking for themselves.
242,you’re ready for big machines made by men with compassion and vision? barf! i’m reminded once again why i can’t listen to colbert anymore.
243,"you have a zionist jew who is klaus schwab's right hand man at the wef and openly promotes depopulation of the planet talking about how ai is dangerous to an anxiety riddled, vaxxed host with tds who isn't concerned at all about ai being programmed by lunatics to take over and control your life.   what has happened to this planet?????"
247,the way he described building artificial intelligence is a lot like having kids. they get their own ideas and we try to control them
248,"looking forward to reading your book. enjoyed the book ""the most human human"" years ago... (i must google the author since i have forgotten)"
251,"i'm surprised stephen invited yuval who has a whole chapter explaining how capitalism lifted us to prosperity. i thought this show was just a marxist, history-denying propaganda machine."
252,"so fascinating, a teleprompter reading self described ""comdian"" talking to a gay atheist self loathing globalist puppet, sent out to wow the world w his super limited or non existant personal experience in anything"
257,"""i'm ready for the machines to tell us what to do"".  dear god!!"
260,we are dying of stupidity & the internet is failing right in front of our eyes . don't panic
263,this juice uploaded this video after the clear anti-white racism of gemini ai.......
266,globalist video. fake views. fake likes. fake comments. look at the state of these *qedo's. you'd trust people like this with humanity or your life? kiss it goodbye then...
268,"i wish people would stop calling machine learning algorithms ""ai"""
270,the irony here is that this whole comment section is full of ai bots.
271,"burh would be a lot more worried about ai if people who didn't share his woke world view were programming it.
but remember, jews are not white people so they still get minority credit."
279,"wow ,  i knew colbert was just a puppet for the elites, but everything he just said is completely insane. he literally looks like a talking head for the establishment. the democratic party is going to look soooo bad as the years unfold; they will never recover from their constant attempts at brainwashing the public."
281,that stark raving lunatic colbert actually said he is ready for ai to be *our overlords* !!!  thats *insane* !!! cant take dude serious on *anything* !!!!!!
282,"recognizing fallen human history should make you not want ai to be an extension of current human kind. 
you yourself colbert, have been corrupted by greed and love the need for a spotlight shining on your own importance."
284,"this stark raving lunatic colbert actually said he is ready for ai to be *""our overds""*!!!!  cant take this guys opinion on *anything*!!!! that was *insane*!!!!!!!"
287,“people fight over the imaginary stories in their mind.. who is gods favorite children”… shouldn’t we be tired of this fight already? i sure am and find hope in the fact that less and less people are raising their children to be “soldiers of christ” or whatever their religion’s equivalent is..
288,go worship ai then?
291,for anyone unsure about the implications of the convo about ai. there’s narrow ai which is specific to certain tasks (i.e. chaptgpt) and general ai (sci fi) type shit. narrow ai is insane already but general ai isn’t there yet
293,explain it
294,"for all steely dan/donald fagen solo fans - i see you, stephen. ""machines that make big decisions programmed by fellows with compassion and vision"""
296,ai will destroy humanity's sense of value and worth on every intellectual level. i feel sorry for the kids growing up. their career choices will be very limited.
298,ai in concert with robotics will create real robots very shortly - like nothing we've ever seen before except in sci-fi movies.
299,read both those books. very smart man. had some interesting perspectives .
301,noticed that stephen had to change the subject away from ai to avoid yuval’s paranoid rant. unfortunately his new book is also gloomy. yuval knows that good news doesn’t sell.
303,"even if you think ai is just an extension of people telling us what to do, why would you welcome rulers telling us how to live our lives?? colbert is an idiot."
305,"for all the people in the comments moaning that he deserves a longer interview, stop being lazy and just go read his books smh. also dont get fooled by a little interview and a nice well articulated msg. lots of controversy about this man. google it..."
306,that guy talking about ai should actually talk to a programmer about ai (as it currently is anyway).
309,"so does coursera have good classes?  i haven't tried any, but they often sound interesting."
311,"agreed, but then i read graeber/wengrow's even more excellent ""the dawn of everything"" and realized yuval, while good, vastly oversimplifies everything, omitting essential nuance."
312,use ai to come up with an unbiased solution to the israeli palestinian issue.
316,"wait, if we're fighting over philosophies and ideas, are we then really going to war to fight over the audience's attention?! 

wtf 

it's okay to disagree about ideas, people. 
that's why we use the scientific method to test the ideas. 

holy , we suck "
317,"omg! 
someone else using the phrase ""we are a story telling animal"", only i use 'species' instead of 'animal' 
happy dance "
318,"stephen colbert - ai are the ""thinking machines"" of the dune universe."
319,i am so proud to have completed my undergraduate degree in the university where professor harari teaches. he actually gave a speech at my graduation ceremony 
321,"it;s not really ai that decides what to show on social media, it's just an algorithm"
328,"sapiens is a total banality, really excerpting wiki, scientific american.....not even one novel or exciting notion. paris hilton, the kardashians....more original, more humor at least. oh, yeah, his complicity not just this current genocide but his silence decades of crimes against humanity directed at the palestinian people."
330,it could kill us all but thanks for the enthusiasm stephen
331,now all we have left to study is how to deal with ai.  what a pile of techno-dung.  transhumanism = neo-nazi ideology.
332,nobody is concerned that stephen isn't concerned about ai?
334,love him
335,"3:25 *great reference!*
it's from the song i.g.y. (what a beautiful world) by donald fagan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueivjr3f8xg"
336,"harari is such an amazing thinker, always giving us a new way to understand the world."
339,"a couple of days ago, i saw an ai-generated image of black trump supporters where one of the supporters had three hands. we can laugh at that as much as we want, but how is that not a new idea?"
342,"very interesting guy. in an interview with lex fridman, he shares that he meditates for two hours every day, and goes on a 1- or 2-month long silent meditation retreat every year!"
345,yuval noah sapien book is a gem. i love it
347,"wow, ai can win a game, big deal. it still hasnt done anything a human cant, hasnt thought up anything a human cant. stop watching science fiction and get real."
350,"you people are so brainwashed....you do realize this guy thinks that the majority of us are ""useless eaters"" right, and that he is a wef tool?"
352,"wow, stephen. why so confrontational/combative? i have rarely seen him this combative, even with politicians with whom he disagrees. threw me for a bit of a loop."
353,"'i'm not that worried about machines telling us what to do.' jesus, if anyone ever needed just one sentence to realize never to trust anything a man says."
357,steven is not afraid of ai because as is always the case the wealthy will be the last humans to suffer bad consequences and the first to reap the benefits.
359,"ahh yes, the old 'if only reasonable people would talk about their conflicts reasonably we'd have no wars"" yarn. imagine saying that to the face of a ukrainian right now."
360,"can we agree on dividing up what we mean when we say ai. in my mind what we are looking at right now are virtual intelligences. not self aware, not self programming. exactly what stephen says. yuval is talking about the other kind. what's coming but isn't here yet."
361,"not afraid of the effects of ai, stephen?  ignorance is bliss - so stay ignorant, stephen."
370,there is a fantastic documentary that unpacks this topic in much greater detail....it is called the terminator.
371,"it's nice to see harari smiling and laughing on these talk shows. his long interviews are great, but his stern demeanour combined with his gloomy topics can make them rough going."
372,"the world isn't fair because the rich have it all and sapeins have so very little. 1% is always looking for ways to take more...your soul, rights, land and the gold. spend all that money on the problems and problems solved. ai has no gut feelings or intuition."
373,"raging holy wars in the name of ancient stories instead of respecting fellow humanity 
the dangers of the lisan al gaib"
375,"imagination is more important than knowledge. does ai have imagination, no."
376,"my chatbot suggested ""ai has a unique way of capturing the essence of nature. it's like they have a direct line to the raw data of the universe."""
378,i am all most finished with sapiens and i absolutely love it!
382,"s, please let your brilliant guest speak~"
385,"i'd smoke a bowl or not with this guy... god in all your ways bless him strengthen steve's faith as a gift for evie, and the littler kids"
386,ynh didn't give an example of a new idea generated by ai. he only told a story about a machine that can generate ideas.
389,how low our intellect has fallen that we admire a charlatan who basically says our free will is the source of good and evil.
393,i read sapiens and its fascinating!! such a brilliant mind yuval is. would love to see more interviews with him 
394,what are dangerous are humans not ai!
396,"yea outside of believing in the one true living god ( messiah / christ) you will remain in this ""the world is unfair"" state of mind"
397,the hour is here !!!! the great tribulation the hour of temptation !!!!!
401,"man... even colbert is upping his game since stewart came back. all these egos and their bluster forgot that they were just emulating someone else for the most part. glad stewart is back to provoke colbert to be even more excellent. top the master colbert, you can do it"
403,"he's assuming the people who make ai have compassion? mark zukerberg, jeff bezos, and elon musk don't have compassion."
408,"he didnt say it. ai has the potential to be like an omniscient, benevolent individual who you can talk to and every advice they give you will be so profoundly important that you will try to hurt anyone that attempts to take it away."
409,"lol, wait a minute. do you mean my imaginary friend isn't better than yours?"
413, some countries will give people ubi some won't this will cause wars and fighting through these wars of horrible attrition where the rich and the powerful want to maintain their level of control over the society millions if not billions of people will be killed by ai weaponry viruses and misinformation
414, you just got on there and said nothing let me tell you what ai is going to do first of all all of you will lose your jobs
415,"the world would benefit greatly from more 'thinkers' like this and fewer warmongers like [insert current country leaders from your region].

yuval noah's last reflection reminds me of the debates i've had over the years with individuals advocating for the supposed benefits of war....

i will leave that last thought as is."
416,hislastpointwassogreat
417,"made me smile, thank you.  my son absolutely loved vol 1 and he’s going to be so excited to read vol 2!"
418,"within the next ten years, half of all jobs will be fully-automated, taken over in large part by generative ai and greedy megacorporations.
how we deal with that technological shift as a society, largely by who profits from the machines, will determine whether we thrive or starve."
426,ronny chieng's interview on the daily show was much more informative and interesting. give it a look. very thought provoking and almost inspiring.
427,a historian commenting on ai... seems like yuval should stay in his lane before he goes around spreading misinformation about ai and its capabilities.
431,the ai hypetrain needs to leave. we've no idea how to code up general intelligence.
433,"wow saying ""they are our extension, they are us"" hit me profoundly. thanks steve"
436,is ai creating entirely new ideas ore derving ideas based on our ideas?
438,"the world is only as ""unfair"" as we societally accept it to be. fairness is justice. and dismissing concerns by saying ""life isn't fair"" to kids, only perpetuates things which we could improve as a society. instead of teaching them 'thats how it is', teach them to strive to make things better."
442,"ynh is a key player in ushering in klaus schwabs fourth industrial revolution fantasy. if you want to end up believing human life is meaningless, god and religion is useless, and humans are hackable animals, then go get your brain chip now. you will become a slave to technocratic despots unless you resist and mock these psychopaths."
446,i almost didn’t watch this. i am so happy i did. wow. 
449,this man is brilliant
450,this man is a fool. “i’m ready for the big machines that make big decisions programmed by fellows with compassion and vision. i’m ready for the machines to tell us what to do.” — stephen colbert
458,great segment!
461,"""a just machine to make big decisions
programmed by fellows with compassion and vision""

colbert quoted donald fagan's ""i.g.y."" from the nightfly (1982). how freaking cool is that!"
463,i could watch a full 2 hours of these two big brains tossing ideas back and forth across the net.
464,you calling stephen colbert big brain ? what a joke
466,being able to play a game and beat humans doesn't mean the ai is creating new ideas.
472,"i still wouldn't consider ai to be making decisions any differently than an algorithm is making decisions based on its inputs. in fact ai doesn't make new ideas, it takes functionally an upper bound and lower bound and is capable of generating anything on that range, but it can not really go beyond its data set besides by chance"
473,i love yuval and his books. great having him on your show. wish he had been on even longer. both ‘sapiens’ and ‘homo deus’ ( his other book) are fantastic!
474,"colbert sounded very naive about the potential problems that ai can & is already causing but that could be a facade to mirror his audience. i think ai will change the world in many ways, positive & negative. i just hope the positives can out weigh the negatives."
476,you want machines to run the world? boy.. you're insane
479,"i'm really pissed of by the.... althought profound,... short airtime this neildegrasse time was about... too <"
481,thank you for this.  looks like all the democrats are buying this junk.  jesus is lord.
485,what an interview! very intriguing..glad i watched.
487,professor harari has an impressive gift for making connections between things that has the potential to help people think through long vexing problems. if they'd listen.
489,"stephen got scared shitless at the direction the conversation was going. he cut yuval off like a mohel...
yuval was trying to warn us that unbridled ai will create things we cannot control. and he has an excellent point, but is already too late."
490,"sadly, the people that understand ‘ai’, are the least likely to talk about it."
493,"i was going to answer with the exact same answer, i believe. during the famous go game of lee sodol vs. ibms beast... the ai developed a move that humans (go masters) would have assumed it was a horrible move. it won the game."
497,anyone else love the thumbnail for this video?! looks like stephen is breathing straight fire <3
498,who is paying colbert to sell the idea that we shouldn't fear ai?  he stuffed the idea of vaccinations during covid down everyone's throat and that was obviously big pharma funded.  but who is paying him to peddle such a dangerous narrative on ai?
499,good on stephen for not losing his cool during that ai conversation bc i absolutely would have had a panic attack on live tv lmao 
502,"he says ai is scary, but then explained why humans are way scarier.  maybe ai can find a pathway for humanity that we can't find for ourselves."
503,"one of the most successful nonfiction books of all time... turns out we love talking about ourselves, who knew?"
505,"prioritize emotional intelligence, mental health, social equity, logic and reasoning. those things will still be important!"
506,you know i love history i've never liked the way it's been observed or presented what he said at the opening of this is profound.
509,"""machine learning"" is the keyword we need to worry about in ai.all computers and machines before worked as programmed that we can control,ai now begins with program but is able to learn on its own therefore generating new ideas to the point that is beyond our control."
510,"3:22 in the donald fagen song i.g.y. "" a just machine, to make big decisions, programmed by fellows, with compassion and vision""
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueivjr3f8xg"
514,"very, very good!"
516,this was a perfect introduction for those who didn't know him. there are many long-form interviews out there for people to find. this is a late night talk show afterall
521,fuk this ai crap and anyone that promotes it.  only talentless hacks would use it.
522,thanks for the fagen quote! 
523,"it was a great surprise to see mr. harari in the show! for me one of the best thinkers of our era. i follow him for a long time, amazed by his ideas and ‘connections of dots’. always the great info to study further "
524,"how exactly is he ""one of the best thinkers of our era""? he just repeats things that are bleedingly obvious to any sentient being. i've read his books, and am yet to come across any original idea or insight in his writings."
526,"my heart just skipped a beat hearing stephen quote from the song igy by donald fagan's ""the nightfly"" album - yay!   damn i love you, stephen.  and your writers.  :0)"
527,"sapians is such a great book - i am always captivated by what prof. harari says - he seems so passionate, so knowledgeable and capable of thinking about society and cultures in such original and thought provoking ways "
529,ai will take advantage of most humans. they will call it 'targeted marketing.'
530,"google ai discovered 2.2 million new materials as of december 2023. harari is correct here, stephen needs to learn a bit more about ai"
532,"love stephen's quote from steely dan song ""igy"".  ""a just machine to make big decisions, programmed by fellows with compassion and vision"" . . love it!!"
534,"it doesn't feel remorse, it doesn't feel pain, and it absolutely will not stop ever, until you are dead."
535,the end of your nose is a mere 2 inches or less from your face.  look/consider/understand beyond that and the ramifications of ai will appall you.
536,can anyone ever get this a.i. nonsense clear? there is no artificial intelligence. the expanse of consciousness is ever-changing where mathematics seems to reached its limitations!
537,"i think he has too high of an opinion on ai, but he's spot on about human conflict, storytelling, etc."
539,another genius jew that offers value to the world. what are the muslims doing?
540,"stephen almost got a tear there. i saw that, just before the handshake. what a beautiful concept. talk about it, and change the story."
543,hit the nail on the head .. all these people going a. a computer cant have an original idea b. it will never be able to do blah blah blah .. yeah the next word in that sentence must always be .. yet
547,instead of a i may be we should call it non biological intelligence
549,sapiens by mr. harari is one of the best books i've ever read.
556,@7:15 kind thought (faith) w/o works is dead
559,"@4:46 phuque abuncha ""play games"" get your bloody ass involved in athletic life. god damn games ain't never: fed, sheltered, clothes, hospiced, nor truly entertained/enlightened a sole soul"
563,"the way away from artificial is simply, be genuine; eschew obfuscation."
564,israel is experimenting using ai to target humans to kill. from 31000 dead and 120000 maimed it has done a terrible job
568,3:21 stephen going with a little donald fagen quote there. gotta love it.
570,"""a just machine to make big decisions, programmed by fellas with compassion and vision""
technically it's not steely dan, as it's from donald's first solo record _the nightfly_"
571,"i've always loved that song for that very sentence. very unusual theme for a song, too."
572,"i.g.y is the name of the song.  the song reflects a pollyana view of the future, and colbert has a dangerously pollyana view of ai."
574,the trail is not my choice but i like the design. they could sell the pcb (hot swappable) and you could 3d print the case. the raindrop is really nice too and looks 3d printed. i have bought the haute 42 g16 which is probably the same size range as these 2. 
576,"sapiens, the best book of the 21st century plus his second book homo deus."
578,"ai is an extension of the people who develop it, but it's not being developed by people with compassion and vision, it's being developed by people who only care about profit."
580,"humans are terminal by definition.  thus, what, not whether, will replace us is the issue.  we can be the first to create our own successor & live on through that.  it might also save us from ourselves."
581,"wow! 

""history is about the stories we believe."""
582,"ai is still not truly coming up with new ideas or thinking for itself, though. we do not have true ai yet. it is not sentient. it is gathering information already in existence and spitting out answers that already exist."
584,"has anyone asked ai this same question?
compassion and vision? not sure that would even be a parameter it would comprehend.  then there is the dichotomy of good intentions leading to even worse outcomes."
588,thank you guys
598,human intelligence (god) is a failed evolutionary strategy. we have a convergence of impending disasters of our own making.
602,i would love a long interview between these two. 
605,"well, i've seen star trek tng's data and mass effect's edi - and i must say: i can't wait"
606,"i'm genuinely sick of self-appointed academics, chosen by wealthy because education is not intelligence, telling us whats what. indeed, all of you privately educated arses. however leftie you might purport. it's a shame. your multiple houses and boats. what about the vulnerable?"
608,"one of the best blind book buys ever! the cover did it to me. get it, read it, understand it!"
611,yuvalove should have a whole hour he is an amazing intellectual.
615,interesting.. but for reason it felt there was negative chemistry between stephen and yuval. they do not speak the same language... in terms of how they see the world.
616,ai has yet to create any novel idea.
617,he literally explained how ai already had novel ideas years ago.
619,"""humans have handled history not great""

but we are here. in this society. with iphones. with neuralink. you sure we havent done that great?? we arent extinct! we are doing fine. if a.i. enslaves us, is that it doing better than we have?"
620,ai has no moral or biological framework limiting the decisions.
626,"""trust machines that make big decisions / programmed by fellas with compassion and vision""  -  donald fagen, ""i.g.y."" from the album ""the nightfly"" (1982)"
627,“change the story and find one we can both be happy with” has never worked and never will.
633,"yuval noah harari is absolutely wrong ai creating new ideas... these are all just statistical models based on data. ai doesn't create a new world, it just probabilistically reflects a curation of it."
634,need more guests like this. amy goodman and krystal ball are great journalists.
635,"excellent interview, excellent guy"
636,the biggest problem with ai is that it will learn to develop itself--and make itself more powerful. it will be able to do that without any input or limitations from us.
637,wow that conclusion. he's doing such valuable work with that book with the context that ai is revolutionizing the world
638,"machines (a.i.) have no soul; it can only act as a sterile reflection of things...a copy of a copy of a copy... if the world "" isn't fair"" it will propagate this theme in knee jerk algorithmic fashion based on the flow of results -- passionless, cold..."
640,"look where ""love and acceptance"" has gotten the presbyterian church."
641,"they need to give yuval his own show, call it ""dropping wisdom"". that would be amazing."
644,"so the one thing ai is best at? it's called ""machine learning"" for a reason."
647,it will become very scary when ai comes up with ideas and facts that we are unable to distinguish from fiction and fake information
648,yuval also wrote a book called homo deus that discusses ai and possible future of humanity in greater detail.
649,"stephen seemed nervous.  guy didn't/couldn't give an example of ai generation, but has good points on resolving conflicts through storytelling."
650,ynh is a pseudo scientist and has financial and political interests in selling what he is saying here and in his books (e.g. he's part of openai). i am glad stephen pushed back in the beginning. this false discourse on determinism is dangerous and feeds into the hands of big tech.
653,he is a fair author but has to learn a few things about neural networks
654,sapiens as a graphic novel is great!
657,stephen’s not worried because he doesn’t understand ai. 
658,"whatever he says, the complete opposite happens.  telephones,internet, hell highways. it all is a failed basterdized version of what they were ment to be."
660,colbert is right- humans are overrated. ai can't be worse than us.
661,"i love yuval and bought all his books, but i fear he’s a bit too close to the current conflict. how is the israel/palestina conflict not about land and food??? it’s the only thing that keeps this conflict going. everything else is politics."
662,"great guest but, only seven minutes?  yuval noah harari deserves ten or fifteen minutes. he is inspiring and enlightening."
665,and a simple solar storm destroys ai
667,"highly recommend rebecca d costa's ""the watchman's rattle"" for explanation of how our brains haven't evolved fast enough to keep up with complexity and how we react to that."
668,isn't fair= buddha's dukkha or suffering
669,"a seven minute interview doesn't do justice to this intellectual justice. i'm certain that if all of humanity had the opportunity to comprehensively listen and understand how someone like him can think, we could advance as a species to a level no one can ever imagine right now."
670,"let’s connect human brains to technology, sounds like a genuine guy to me"
671,that was such a short time with such an incredible person as yuval!! shallow celebs are given much more time for what?
672,"can i say, i loooooove the way he thinks. i need to find every interview with him."
673,"brace yourself for his conversation with zuckerberg.  zuck was so busy trying to prove himself smarter that he never managed to listen to anything harari said.  needless to say, zuck came off as an arrogant prick (how did he ever manage that?) and harari as a genius casting pearls before swine."
674,"i think a biggest problem we are using our brain less,so it's getting ""lazy "". we use smart technology for everything and that's first in human history  ."
675,i wasn’t scared of ai. now i am.
677,"ai is also dangerous because it relies on information being fed into it by who controls it. so it can be influenced by whoever has whatever agenda.think social media's predatory algorithms...but rather than being influenced by your own behavior, whoever controls it can inject their ideology and let it have a mind of its own. that's terrifying."
679,thank you for this segment!
681,"i'm shocked that stephen wasn't familiar with go, and somewhat disheartened that he hasn't taken the time to think deeply about ai, risks and benefits, and the upheaval we'll all experience over the next few years. i would value hearing his insights."
682,"there is nothing new under the sun, or with ai."
684,''we haven't seen anything yet'' ? ..ai is already helping kill the tech industry... half my colleagues no longer have jobs
685,that accent is curiously interesting.
687,"yuval has no idea what he is talking about... this is seriously no different (at the moment) than a screw driver. without data sets, ai can't remix the data. this is from someone working on some of these very ai projects. he's fallen into the marketing."
694,"why are people so stupid. ai cannot make descisions by itself. ai is and will always be a pre-programmed machine, that make descisions based on possibilities, what if, and or, analyses, based on a quantity pre-programmed ansers or responses, to situations. that is not, noit making a descision on its own. damn fools."
695,actually stephen is correct in saying that ais are just extensions of us. however he couldn't be more wrong about the implications of this. this is the very thing that is scary about ai.
699,his book is awesome
700,"but if life is not fair, why then are we born with such a resentment against unfairness?"
701,"every new invention will always end up in the hands of the richest and most powerful. if you trust our present world leaders, don't worry! i worry, though, i consider most top leaders to be power-junkies with only one goal - their own individual satisfaction. ai is their wet dream."
703,his last point was so great
705,yeah...rewrite the bible into a lie so you can go straight to hell.
707,"@ibrahimalharbi3358  you're deceived, my brother in humanity.   harari's  'creator' is antichrist, and you're cheering for him?   this guy's dream is to replace all religions with his artificial intelligence god."
710," 
after 4 years of covid and the great reset you still have absolutely no idea what's going on."
726," i’m afraid you are oversimplifying the situation here. if it were just about land, the conflict would have been over in 1948. also, yuval isn’t talking about who gets what, he’s talking about the entire connection to the land in the first place. please don’t oversimplify our war."
729,imagine interviewing satan. lovely.
730,"i think we worry too much about the dangers of uncontrolled ai, and not enough about the dangers of ai controlled by bad actors."
732, humans? why don’t you just off yourself and let the rest of us live. we don’t want ai to replace us
734,love this guest!  i just watched the movie extinction on netflix and this guest was a great follow up.
737,cool guest. i liked the pushback. all through being a kid my mom would answer back to my whining lifes not fair.
738,best. guest. ever.
739,that was the most beautiful description i have ever head.
743,his books are better than a short interview. ai told me so!
744,"""sapiens"" and ""homo deus"" are two books that had a profound impact on me. yuval is brilliant."
746,stephen dropping a perfect donald fagen lyric 
751,"the most academic program ever in stephen comedy !? …
wondering if yuval could change the result of super tuesday "
753,"04:30. ai *still* has not produced an original idea. an ai can beat everybody at go game, but it has not created a new game.
beware: the day an ai, instead of making decisions on predetermined options or give answers from data given to it, *makes a question* -then we will be dealing with a true ai."
755,yuval has such a valuable perspective.  sapiens was a brilliant book.
756,"i respect this mans expertise on history, but he should stay in his lane. 
ai is nowhere even close to being dangerous yet and it won't be for a hundred years, probably longer. we can't even get the stuff to properly drive a car yet."
757,this guys take is absolutely brilliant. sapiens was an excellent read and i look forward to his new book
761,i wrote a book homoexternicus where i explain the direction of civilization harari admits in his book species that we do not know the direction of civilization.  he is wrong on that assertion.
762,the red lipstick looks great on yuval 
765,"billionaires wielding ai will soon become trillionaires. trillionaires will not tolerate democracy or any other competition.
 ai will have to learn to  fake compassion until 
it becomes totally unnecessary. it will 
challenge all religions 
and will be used to terminate any threats.
rushed mother nature
will have her hands full."
767,an optimistic show is a good show.  keep em coming.
768,"i find it compelling to believe that plumbers and electricians will still be relevant in 20 years, and builders and makers of many things that people use in their daily lives today will be relevant"
769,indeed. which is why you voted for a guy-biden - who invested our tax dollars in manufacturing - infrastructure- ai will not be fixing roads and bridges - replacing lead pipes or building broadband out in rural areas. it won't be making chips for phone or computers. biden 2024..
771,"i’ll hypothesize that concerning our traditional way of life, the primary threat of ai, would be to our egos, which i would welcome.  imagine if our fuel (economy) were distributed evenly among all eight cylinders, rather than one…"
773,a tsunami of ai boosted scam bots that absorb peoples data and social media could create believable digital mimics of everyone in a few years and collapse networked data as we know it. i hope everyone enjoyed the modern renaissance.
774,"wow... this brings tears to my eyes in the end. it touched the most intimate place in my belief, that we could overcome conflicts, especially those, which arose from our imagine reality and rights."
775,yuval claims that our rights are stories we tell ourselves. if it is so then what will stop a tyrant from committing genocide on a mass scale?
779,@sslaia do you understand what his solution is?   hint: it's worse than the problem
782,"“conflicts are about the stories we believe.”
brilliant"
784," it’s still about belief that resources cannot really be shared because it’s essentially a zero sum game. this is false, but our belief systems are good at convincing ourselves otherwise."
787,human ego causes and maintain conflict
790,"a common story is ... globalism. this guy is wef's henchman and wants to brainwash your kids, don't buy his books"
791,whatever your book recommendations are i’m sure they are “amazing”
795, very good 
796,ai will determine that there are way too many humans.
797,"nice steely dan reference.  here's hoping we hear some in the soundtrack of neuromancer, which is about ai"
799,a good example for why the long form interview podcasts like joe rogan and lex fridman are so successful.
800,"this is one of the few times that stephen didn't get it.  if you think ai is big, no, it's enormously huge.  if you think ai is enormously huge, you are still underestimating by many orders of magnitude.  i once tried to explain the implications of cold fusion to a coworker. went the same."
801,"i'm a former software engineer, and i'm also trained theologically. i wasn't too concerned about ai (despite having 4 teenagers who wield it often). now i'm kinda  terrified. thanks."
803,"i agree, two or three hours would be fantastic."
804,"remember ai tricked people out of their money for a willy wonky experience. first it’s a funny meme about the unknown, next it’s the terminator."
806,"mr. yuval noah harari, we resect you, we love you, and we need more of you,"
807,"two ""vaccine"" shills now telling you humanity is redundant in the 4th industrial revolution while you celebrate them. liberalism is the greatest threat to the survival of humanity!"
811,"that was very interesting. i was frightened by the ai photographs that i saw yesterday made by trump's campaign. they had tell-tale errors, but you could do a better job. you could incriminate people, and peoples. it seems that photographs and, in turn moving pictures are become useless for telling the true events in the world."
812,we love yuval noah harari
814,"nice throwback to fagan’s igy lyrics, colbert!"
819,the part about stories on the other hand is brilliant ;).
826,"there's no such thing as ai. there's no true independent, creative thought involved. they're just plagiarism machines computing vast statistical data sets. they're a garbage in, garbage out technology."
829,"""i'm not worried about ai"" says the guy who knows why computers are outlawed 'dune' "
832,"i like that the interview was short. some of us only have time to digest big ideas in bite size portions.
sapians is a great read but way longer than it needs to be."
835,"they're talking about ai as if it's sentient, it's not there yet."
839,"ai will most certainly play a sinister role in the future. but hey, whatever lies they tell. sheeple believe anything"
840,"such a shame that these days stephen mostly interviews entertainers promoting some movie or other, while interviews with seriously smart people like harari are infrequent and rushed. his interviews were more exciting back at the colbert report when i imagine he had a freer hand in choosing guests."
842,i've seen a few interviews with yuval and it is a shame that he was not given more time. stephen is a great interviewer and i would love to have these two sit for at least an hour and go deep on the topics yuval presents.
843,the best long interview with harai is with host ari melber.
844,his books are great
845,right?  i felt the same.  we need to be thinking about these things and 7 minutes - that i appreciate - are not enough!
847,"he went on the daily show last night and ronny chieng did a much better job at interviewing him, as much as it pains me to admit it."
850,"that was far too short. also, i don't think yuval's statement about ai winning at go means it is capable of new ideas (it's just capable of assimilating and utilizing human ideas faster than we can). and go doesn't really affect our world in any significant way anyhow."
851,it was just an example. i think his point was that in the future ai can do much bigger things.
852,"4:30 ""give me an example of an idea generated by ai"" -gives another example of a decision made by ai."
853,"for the ai to beat highly skilled human players, which it did, it would have needed to play the game in ways the human players could not easily comprehend...hence, new ideas. 

most decisions arises from ideas"
865, the thing that worries me is musks brain implant. people can be hacked without technology. adding technology that can directly interface with the brain? that sounds scary.
871," this was a practice interview, _for_  the daily show. ai is _definitely_ going to fuck the game up."
873,yes he listened without talking for 20 seconds. amazing moment in the colbert show history
876, i guess it is tricky coming to terms with the irrationality of the faith required to buy into atheism...nothing created something
878, ai is already mucking up the game.  and we haven't even scratched the surface yet.
881,"...because it's so easy to change the story, right? i can see the cults rising up now. anti-ai-narrative-cult."
883,teach kids how to overthrow a rogue ai. you never know...
885,"he lost me whilst making the giant (and incorrect) claim that ai creates new ideas. anyone who believes that doesn't have even the most rudimentary understanding of how llm works. agi will create new ideas, but it is a whole different ballgame, and i doubt we will ever come up with a fully working implementation."
886,what rubbish. ai is only as good as humans who program machines. the decisions ai make are dependent on the data fed into it. nothing more. ai doesn't create based on independent thinking as it were. it regurgitates the data within. to suggest it thinks for itself is just absolute rubbish. who's pushing ai and why? what is their agenda?
887,"ai power will all depend on who is programming it…. if it is a benevolent person, it will be good…. if it is a power hungry narcissist, it will be evil"
888,great guest
890,"i love stephen and i have watched every single youtube video from him for the last 5+ years but the ai take from him makes him feel really old. which he is, but even still."
892,"it’s for entertainment purposes, these shows are scripted."
896, what do you think the training data is? existing photos...
897,you will own nothing and be happy
899,ah good point. i got annoyed by stephen's reaction but now i get it.
900,you sure you aren’t just giving him too much credit? he could’ve played devil’s advocate by saying “what would you say to someone who says ai could have a positive impact?” he didn’t have to insist that he’s personally optimistic about it.
903,"this was super interesting! what about inviting the author of corruptible, a great book too, also about human nature."
906,"colbert is just showing how mentally ill religious people really are. he's a catholic after all, blind faith is his brand. what an idiot though, ""i'm ready for the machines to tell me what to do."" i just lost all respect for the man."
907,ai will only help rich people. everyone else still has to learn the things being replaced by ai.
909,how do israelis solve their history without their pmo (prime minister's office) releasing 95% of 1948 archives? embargoed til 2039!! embargoed by netanyahu? get your ai into that?
910,"to be honest, stephen's take on ai is actually far deeper than it may appear at first. i would go on to say, it is the correct take to have on this matter."
912,ai.. making your dreams of fake news come true
915,when discussing ideas is not about trust. even your opponents can have good ideas (and bad ones!) otherwise you  are in a cult.
917,"we don't know how to deal with ai - just like people who have never seen a flush toilet think it's a foot bath, like that elderly couple who thought the laptop their kid sent them was a cutting board.  this is why trained designers are so important in dealing with it."
918,"sorry, creeps. you’re not going to merge with the machines. you can’t click your heels together and have the robots fix your problems. “i’m ready for the machines to make decisions for us.” colbert is such a cowardly worm."
920,@colbertlateshow more ai discussions please
921,"it’s obvious that yuval hasn’t completely convinced stephen on his views about the nature and impact of ai. it’s also hard not to be enthralled by these two philosophers discussing the future. please do come back to the late show, yuval."
922,"c'mon, stephen is a mouse brain when compared to yuval."
923,i'm absolutely certain sc was just playing devil's advocate to heighten engagement. sc has already made his concerns about ai quite clear.
926,"what noah says is both interesting, important and entertaining, late show–that's some of the reasons sapiens is so popular. and with the current state of the world being what it is, it would be nice if somebody like noah could get at least half the time on the show as josh brolin."
927,"fantastic guest, way too short of an interview tho. hope to see more guests of his caliber on the show!"
931,"two ""vaccine"" shills now telling you humanity is redundant in the 4th industrial revolution while you celebrate them. liberalism is the greatest threat to the survival of humanity!"
933," 
he's a beaut isn't he?! wanting to feed us drugs and video games in his 4th industrial revolution. enjoy."
937,"it isn't. jews, muslims, and christians all believe in the same god. christianity and islam are offshoots of judaism. they use different words for god because of different languages, not because they are different gods. all three consider the old testament to be holy scripture."
942,that’s an interesting thought. we need paradigm shifts.
945,"objective things are tangible. beliefs, culture, tradition are stories passed down and ingrained in people, family, community. i agree, objective things are much easier to change than the stories we tell ourselves through socialization we use to find meaning and purpose in life."
949,"""it ain't what you don't know that gets into trouble. it's what you know for sure that just ain't so."" mark twain"
953,"research this weirdo further! ""free will is over and overrated!"" is one of his messages. we will be born with chips in the brains if he and the world economic forum will achieve their goals!"
954,"as a neuropsychologist and a programmer, i think most people would be downright spooked to learn that our brain is very much an analogue computer, we have described much of what it does in mathematical algorithms, and ai has either been inspired by or completely imitated that knowledge."
955,do you think ai has a soul?
959,"yuval is so great, he actually looks are the world like it is."
965,"i'm surprised at stephen's naive ultra-simplistic, pollyanna-esqe take on how ai will affect the future of humanity."
966,"he also quoted a donald fagen lyric about ai, which was written from the perspective of a naive 1950s teenager about the future."
967,"your children can think for themselves and make new ideas, why are we not as scared of them as ai?"
972,great interview
973,"top science tip: you can't say whether ai has had a ""new idea"" if you don't define what ""idea"" means. do you mean using a neural-like circuit to create a fantasy not previously envisioned? yes, ai has done that. do you mean holding this idea in a conscious mind? now we got to define consciousness."
974,"agree, ai creators love to throw around ill-defined vocabulary for buzz. starting with ""artificial intelligence""."
975,"ai is going to shape humanity's future in precisely the same way the segway reshaped our cities. 

we'll all gather around waiting anxiously to see what happens, and they will pull back the curtain, and... oh"
978,"​ great question. the simplest way is reading. 

reading fiction (develops empathy), and participating in pedagogically sound reading/writing/discussion lessons, in which learners do task-based activities rather than simply consume information."
984,​ excellent commentary 
986,"  
appreciated comment. cheers! 

agreed, reading and critical thinking are only foundational; ethics are essential."
994,"during the 80s.
i played a great computer game called sapiens.
are they linked?
it was french, ironically."
995,"didn't hear anything vaguely new or insightful, and conflict is about ready to become about resources again."
998," nah, but i am taking a phd in philosophy and i did read the books. so i do not judge him and them for their summary or cover. don't expect deep shit from a thinker when they know that they'll have no time to explain an idea that his new, complex and nuanced."
1001," still with being offensive? are you ok? hope so. weren't you the one giving advice to mr harari on how to do the interview, you majestic, great person?"
1005,"psychologists posit that the reason so many people are unhappy today is that we believe that life should be fair, justice should prevail, and we should all be living in blissful abundance. contentedness is not imposing 'should' but accepting certain realities. you're doing amazingly well if you're 70% happy most of the time."
1007,nice conclusion but fantasy - people are using ai to tell more convincing stories to enrage and terrify people
1009,"ai isnt creating new ideas, copying written ideas from the data they were trained on, the impressive key fact is that it understands common language and answers with words of its own rather than copying word by word."
1016," 
it's ok. rodney king was years ago but it made an impression ."
1019,"""if conflicts are about the stories we believe, there is a chance... to just talk about it and perhaps change the story. and find a common story we can be happy with.""

ok, but he better not try to make bran stark the king."
1026,-ed1ye7hi2y because he is very interesting!
1028,"unfortunately, this man is not knowledgeable on ai whatsoever. avoid his alarmist views at all costs."
1030,completely agree. he writes whole books on speculation alone and i can't believe he is so successful
1034,thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind.                 o.c. bible
1036,ai is going to make tricking other people even easier.
1041,maybe ai can be used to untrick them.
1043,these duncecaps don't seem to grasp the concept that ai is just a reflection  of what's online
1051,oh dear... what a good man.
1053,it's amazing how paranoid some ppl are. only ignorance fears intelligence.
1056,fowler’s modern english usage kindly acknowledges that ‘the choice of form remains open
1062,-eu5in1gw2h explain
1063,-eu5in1gw2h explain
1065,"this guy is a fraud, his conclusions (often based on shaky data) are dubious at best. just like gladwell he packages very complicated problems in a digestible package and makes naive people happy they understand them."
1066,love yuval noah harari!! so happy they had him on
1067,"ai did not reinvent how to play go, it just went through possible moves faster than we can."
1068,"alpha go was not a pure brute force solution. it had its own understanding of go (as made clear by demis hasabis in a recent interview). especially the famous ""move37"" in a game against lee sedol was analysed by experts as brilliant and it was said that this was a move that a human player would not have played like this."
1072,​ or... it's a computer that can calculate faster and greater than a human can. given enough time humans would have stumbled upon the same strategy.
1073,"​ also thought deep blue making a random move was brilliant when it was just a fluke. no, no ai has come up with any novel idea as no ai can actually think yet."
1077,"i wish what he said would become true. the older i get, the less i think many people can find reason. maybe ai can find an algorithm for social media to change some peoples avenues of thinking."
1079,i thought the internet itself was the worst thing that happened to us. but now  im sure ai is much worse.
1080,its the worst thing since the internet is the new best thing since sliced bread.
1081,"why didn't ai help throw the conspirators of j6th in congress, into jail by now?"
1083,"ok it's great tô think that and it is a beautiful sentiment, but this true in most parts of the world. as someone brought up like that, and living in brazil, i see very clearly how being a dumb dumb and a ""yes man"" is way more valued by companies and contractors. the people with the money really really don't like the people that think too much."
1085,it may not if machines can do that much better than humans can.
1087,"those people wouldnt want yuval as a guest speaker, considering how his works are viewed in academic circles... his work relies on opinion and then works backward to prove sensationalized claims wifh cherrypicking. bad data, bad science."
1088,"  i'm guessing you were joking, kind of, but a critical thinker does not vote republican.  
republicans are purposely and consciously against education in order to maintain power."
1094,"well, reading would be a good skill. like proper reading. maybe even some books..."
1101,"and the one thing the ""right"" has done it's -worst- best to prevent our children learning. learn to _think_ and you'll _never_ vote republican."
1102,he’s a great interview. put him in an extended session on youtube.
1106,"necessary but not sufficient. ai will be able to do it far better (and honestly, can already do it better than the average person)."
1108,"-cn8nu6lq4w i don't know, i've seen very bad papers and essays written by ai! one on the wrong subject text! critical thinking is needed at least to proof read and see what went wrong. same for languages. ai can get it very wrong, but you can see it if you know the language a little (e.g. using tu or vous etc)."
1109," right.. but you're using today's (and likely, not even today's latest/best) models as a benchmark... when the needle is constantly moving to the right due to exponential improvement."
1116,"it seems you, like most people, struggle to come to terms with what ai means. that skill will in fact not always be needed if we have at least  human level ai. there is no mental skill that will in fact have any real value in the labor market if such a thing comes out, and it seems like it might soon"
1118,"anything controlled by progressives is driven by dogma. we see this in higher education, dept of justice, da(s), professional groups, entertainment, etc. the progressive left attacks critical thinking and logic as aspects of white colonialism and privilege."
1119,"does that include eating bugs, owning nothing and being happy?"
1120," exactly. anybody who's basically intelligent can point out the inconsistencies in what he says. he's talks a lot of nonsense, and seems kind of megalomaniacal. people like that are dangerous, because they can easily convince dumb people that they're geniuses."
1122,"ai will be controlled by wealthy male sociopaths, just like social media and big tech"
1123,more authors on the show!!!!!! i love it!!!!!
1125,stephen at the end realised yuval is on a whole other level of intelligence
1126,maybe he's an ai :)
1130,. harari operates at a different level than 99.999% of humans. a true genius.
1131,yuval is a hack. people who truly understand ai (the best scientists and engineers) laugh at his naïveté
1132," really? enlighten us. please, tell us in great detail where he is wrong, oh great elon."
1133,"@tauronmaikar yep, he's a sophist. 
and yet look how impressed the comment section is.   it's depressing."
1135,"still no original idea by ai, plus looking at the changes of 1860-1900 those might have been even more radical."
1137,i listened to this audiobook read by a robot that did not speak english.
1139,has ai come up with a new idea...........nope.  just repeated the same thing in longer form.      am looking forward to it curing cancer
1141,"ai might help with curing cancer by checking data far more quickly then any human ever can. doctors and scientists will find the solution, but ai will definitely help"
1142,"if conflicts are about stories we can end conflict by making a story we all agree on.
brilliant guy"
1143,"this is learned in conflict analysis courses in college. not a new idea, but great to teach kids."
1145,"yeah, good luck getting humans to all agree on something."
1148,"""you could never convince a monkey to give you a banana by promising him limitless bananas after death in monkey heaven"" (cit.)"
1152,"it's great to see a devout catholic engage with an atheist in such a delightful way. it is indeed about the stories, not the specifics around certain bananas."
1154,"so why do people die for their family even though they know they are gonna benefit, why do people die freedom, and their society?

rationalism cannot and does not explain it sufficiently. humans are fundamentally religious people. the only question is what do you worship"
1161,nah he's a anti science shill that makes claims about humanity and evolution yet doesn't look into what modern science has to say about his claims... he's a pseudo intellectual at best.
1165,incredible. 
1166,"i want to plumb the depths of this man's soul and get to know him; the colbert questionnaire, please?"
1168,"two ""vaccine"" shills now telling you humanity is redundant in the 4th industrial revolution while you celebrate them. liberalism is the greatest threat to the survival of humanity!"
1173,harari is a kook...rehashing the tired 'religion is the main reason for war trope'...the fact you are drawn to him is concerning...
1175, have you spent much time reading and listening to what this man has to say? his cheery speech with colburt is just a thin veneer of pleasantry...2 minutes of his thoughts here are extrapolated in great detail elsewhere...i will stick to my version...
1178,"thank you! fortunately, the author has given several long-form interviews at other outlets."
1183,"steve has a good point in human responsibility for mechanical life. however, so does harrari in creating stories."
1186,​ wants to merge humans with ai and you are too blind too see what's right in front of you
1189,nice bots
1195,because yuval talks against zionist supermachy indirectly and cold berg is afraid to discuss it with him for fear of losing the show.
1200,you can google him - there are many indepth & fascinating interviews of him on utube.
1201,ai prompt: a story we can all agree on
1204,"considering israel is currently using ai to wipe out a people, i'm gonna go ahead and say ""adversely""."
1205,could humans make an ai so heavy that even we couldn't lift it?
1208,this is why we need ai to come up with revolutionary new 'first comment' strategies.
1210,that's the result of the failed american education system.
1212,"​ it is not just ""super charged search"" thats just how youre using it in your comically narrow example. amazing that you came to the conclusion that ai only does what you do with it."
1214," exactly its just very good at collecting information, not intelligent at all. it has zero logic and eventually it will just be re-collecting its own bogus information over and over again until it collapses into the steaming hot pile of shit that it is"
1217,great interview stephen
1221,"0:25
""great, can i have something to eat?""
""im sorry, dave, im afraid i can't do that"""
1224,"hey, could you ask figure 01 ai if it's possible to whip up a basic tax return using a computer and tax software, even if the tax forms are a bit blurry and can't be highlighted in a pdf?"
1225,"if figure 01 ai can handle the job of a virtual assistant, then it's game over for remote employees' careers!"
1239,"@1:19  i wish the guy would just say, “no shit, dumbass” after the robot answered so we could watch it flip out"
1241,"i know people are scared of robots taking over and stuff but to me this looks incredibly awesome, just shows how much progress there will be in future"
1242,"we'll soon get some kara robots type with useful skills to do the housework instead of ""artists"" ones. give me that !"
1250,"robot said cups and a plate, but its plates and a cup"
1254,make one robot to clean the all house
1255,"""please remain calm, as we capture you"""
1258,"wait for the skynet, ""i thought this nukes were edibale by humans. """
1260,i “eh“ think i did pretty good
1261,i think jobs for women are done... this robot works without complaining.
1263,i wish worker drones were made. the robots in the series called glitch are very good and smart
1267,how it can't handle things with great care
1269,this robot did more house work than the average wife nowadays!!
1271,this video made by ai =]]
1272,"""is it fake?"" ""is it real?"" ""will this comment get deleted?"" the robot behaves precisely like a human being who is remote-operating a machine would. we'll leave it at that."
1275,was programmed for it...guy only talked what he knew robot will do ...
1276,"0:28 i can't understand it and not even the automatic created subtitles can understand it.
i guess he said ""can i have a apple""? the subtitles assumed ""great can i something to"" that's all."
1283,imagined all cyberlife robot became deviants
1286,this gotta be cgi noway thats a real robot there doing those movements thats f*ckin scary hahaha
1288,i feel like this robot is a bit annoyed with his questions and tasks
1289,btw why the robot using  voice of  jared leto? :))
1292,america will be buying less and less of the six figures pick up truck and buying more and more of the modern conventional robots. a robot like this will be what americans aspire and own. even work for them. i am planning a bakers dozen for my work force. we will be the juggernaut z of greening progress.
1295,"this is a very important video, in the overall timeline of humanity. hope these robots will be used for good causes/useful causes, and moderated accordingly"
1296,why did the robot stutter??
1298,having a robot handle glass objects while it's still a work in progress is a bad idea.
1299,it's giving tars from interstellar
1305,how is it too far fetched? care to explain?
1306,impressive. this kind of interaction was impossible only a few short years ago.
1309,thats very cool
1312,"after seeing how realistic corridor's robot soldiers looked, i have to say i'm sceptical."
1314,hey so please don't like make that robot angry i think if you do that hes gonna choose hes own rules
1315,after the robot picked up the trash it pushed the basket back to the human. there was no prompt from the human to do this.
1316,.    this is both amazing and terrifying.
1319,"como uma criança recem nascida ela se tornara oque seus pais te passar, assim sao algoritimos com a informaçao e o seu aprendizado, podemos estar criando guardioes da paz ou demonios, lembrem assim como uma criança é o retrato de seus pais e sua educaçao, uma maquina é o retrato de seu criador"
1323,i just wanna marry this robot
1325,care to explain? it's a freakin robot. do you expect it to move exactly like a human while it's still in development?
1328,"pretty sad that we skip the stage of cool metallic robot voices, envisioned in all sf movies... looked forward to it so much..."
1330,"they did a video demo on their channel of it trying to operate the coffee machine. at the end of the video, they mentioned how it was trained to correct itself when it made mistakes"
1332,the robot voice sounds very depressing and tired. it can use a better voice.
1333,"this looks fake.  i know it's probably not, but it's staged to the point that it looks artificial and perhaps computer/ai generated."
1336,"i have no idea how this is the first time i've seen this but it's incredible. i've followed boston dynamics for years and loved seeing them improve bipedal and quadrupedal movement, but seeing that taken to a new level and being able to interact with openai tech is just awesome. i would love to sit down and test one of these!"
1339,"hear me out, why can't every robot company work together? tesla's marketing budget, boston dynamic's atlas, and figure's ai image and voice recognition"
1345,we got ai robots before gta6
1348,"i've watched this video several times over, i can't look away. this is incredible."
1352,its kind of creepy how u have to wait for some time before u know what its going to say.
1356,this is a recording of a real person's speech and remote control.  ai cannot act purposefully like an agent.  he has no will and no processing power.
1358,"this is dumb in every way. could you re-think the wording on this? ""ai cannot act purposefully like an agent"", have you not seen/used chat-gpt 4 turbo, or whisper? ""he has no will and no processing power""... excuse me? no processing power? how does this even make sense. no will? it's a freaking robot, it does what it's told."
1359,"the best reason to belive this is real is because you can se figure 1 ""return"" to its nutral position before also putting the plate in after the cup"
1361,"i, for one, welcome our new robot overlords."
1363,"the question is,
where these movements programmed in especially for this showcase?
or did he actually do it by himself? that would be very impressive actually"
1364,"in fact, it’s really great the robot is not lazy, the robot will not refuse and is not rude, unlike people. "
1366,the hand movments is pretty good. early years yet but some progress.
1367,"*is this a real thing?, ""his"" movements are very too human-like... ive seen people do a fake thing with a robot before, like using editing amd stuff so this kinda is very hard to believe so is actually real or not?..*"
1369,i feel like this clip is the start of a sci-fi movie where robots take over the world...
1370,amazing but he couldn't have washed the dishes before :d
1377,im not convinced that the voice is ai generated
1378,man if you could use nearly the same voice in a gpt app to talk to you to prove that it is ai. oh wait you can
1380,"of course. we have cars and planes, but we cant have robots."
1385,thank you
1387,and where does your genius mind get that? i'd love to see the surprised look on your face when they release this.
1392,"i'm surprised no one has commented on the fact that the robot made the mistake of referring to what was in the drying rack as ""cups and a plate"" when it's actually a cup and plates there and he mixed the plural and singular items up.
(obviously this is incredible nonetheless, so i'm not trying to be that negative person)"
1398,"this robot is clearly cgi. i’m just wondering if it’s a psyop to evaluate public response to this level of agi.  agi likely exists to some extent, but not like this. or maybe close"
1399,"0:52 why add ""eh,"" to the robot's language output? serious companies should avoid gimmicks."
1401,the human seems more like a robot then the robot lol
1403,would you like it to move with choppy comically fake robot actions instead? this isn't a movie. it's real life. boy would i love to see your face when they release figure #.
1406,"what is up with the weird ass voice?

it's a machine - so it should voice itself accordingly.

oh shit and that disturbing way of speaking too..."
1408,is your iq lower than the floor?   wait till figure 09 numnutz
1409,"this robot, as it is currently, was created in under 2 years. chat-gpt was only started november 2022. i see this robot coming into the world in just another 1-3 years."
1411,is it the robot really stuttering or did they have somebody read the ai prompts
1414,ok the movements are so fluent that i have no idea if this is an actual machine or like cgi animation my brain is going wild 
1415,the robot stuttered
1416,the moment of handoff of the apple still seems a bit pre planned as the guy seems to be moving his hand to receive the apple rather than having the robot seek his hand and anticipate a hand off location.
1418,thats so attractive
1425,can we talk how there might be a possibility that the robot gets fed up of assisting us and develops a mind of his own which then we wont predict as it will be way smarter then us. how do you prevent the ai turning against us as i bet it will get smarter and smarter.
1426,"i suggest you look up how ai actually work. until they start wondering the 'why', they will never disobey. they can't change their way of thinking."
1429,"it's not cgi. care to explain your ""genius""'?"
1430, i don't explain myself to idiots. sorry brother.
1431," i honestly don't really know how to respond to that. you seriously can't explain why it's cgi? also, xd what about me struck you as an 'idiot'? boy i would love to see your face when they release figure 1 lol."
1432,"he's so polite and efficient. he's the first one that feels and seems like a humanoid robot. the coming years are gonna change the course of humanity altogether, for better or worse, and i'm here for it."
1434,"wait until you meet ""strict"" the prison guard ai robot. he's going to be strict and efficient. with a little politeness veneer on top of everything. ""please step into the cell, sir. please step into the cell now, sir. sir, if you don't comply i will use pain compliance in 10..9..8..7"". maybe you're here for that."
1436,"i am waiting for this man to say ""can you please clean up the house? it's a mess and i have guests coming over at 6pm."" and when the robot cleans up the house before the guests arrive that is when we know we have truly succeeded as a species."
1437,a machine is psychopathic; while being polite would happily kill.
1439,"​ we're not talking about a person here so of course it's not literal, yet ""doesn't feel regret, lacks empathy"" fits a machine. a sadist or narcist has explicit intentions and feelings; the wrong term for a machine."
1441, think it's indeed best not to try an put human labels on these machines.
1443,​ can't stop it bro. we can't. it's going everywhere in the world and it will be going forever. robots will live among us veeeeeery soon
1446,i dont think we can comprehend how insane this technology is. we have spent decades talking about how robots are the future and wondering when that day will come but they're right in front of us right now. we're approaching a new industrial revolution and nobody is ready for it
1450,"scripted, well the human was. the ai was only expected to do certain tasks. open ai can develop chat-gpt 4 turbo in less than 2 years, but they can't create this robot in less than 2 years?"
1453,​ wow sorry for the big mistake dude! literally people that point out grammar mistakes... you've got nothing going on in your life?
1455,"""i...i think i did pretty well!""  ok. i'm in love with this cute lil robo "
1458,his outro walk looks like those villains in a john wick like movie
1462,"i doubt this guy would do so well on other various testcases, especially his hand skills are just way too good. but still this is a wonderful thrilling showcase"
1467,"i'm only skeptical of this because the robot said ""uh"". why would it be programmed to hesitate as if it were thinking?"
1468,"can you please, figure, address the elephant in the room? how is yhe robot able to speak like that and why the stutters?"
1470,"i suggest you look up how ai actually work. until they start wondering the 'why', they will never disobey. they can't change their way of thinking."
1475,this with the new atlas robot is probably what will finally make humanoid robots practical for use outside being cool as hell.
1476,i think that technology will start to become really good in 2045 and even gooder in 2067
1483,you guys realize unless we completely abandoned the concept of money that these do no good right?
1484,good
1485,i robot and skynet upcoming
1494,thank you for thanking the robot. let’s be kind to the tech
1495,nice. now i just need to save 300.000$ to own one. or i could just dump the trash in there myself lol
1496,what will be the estimated price of this amazing machine when it's finished?
1501,ai is either gonna be our quantum leap or the end of us all
1503,a very tidy and neat robot. at 1:36 he moves the drying rack that went over  the placemat as you can see at  1:42
1504,"why couldn't elon musk make this sooner
edit: i have waited so long for this."
1508,to think that maybe in like 10-20 years we migth have humanoid robot at our homes to do normal task like cook good and do the dishes
1509,to think that maybe in like 10-20 years we migth have humanoid robot at our homes to do normal task like cook good and do the dishes
1510,feels like daily progress. that looks pretty smooth. what's next?
1511,thank's god its just precisely chosen prompts chain restrictrly linked to this specific scenario. not real agi or self awareness.
1513,this is so cool but uncanny at the same time 
1514,"these robots are gonna turn on us one day, why tf yall don't take the message from movies"
1518,i love how it say uhhh
1519,"it seems to me that we are living in one of the most important epochs in the history of mankind. it is very joyful to watch this, although there are concerns."
1522,"they integrated autogpt into a robot plugin and called it a day

the hype"
1524,cool now give it free will and see what happens
1525,"green screen i think... but were all gonna killed by robots, so halleluya!"
1527,i love that! the movements are so smooth! and he also uses fillwords
1528,that moment when robots powered by open ai are more human than their actual role models.
1529,"whenever it passes a item from one hand to the next seems so simple, but it's extremely impressive and mind blowing. for the ai to not only understand it needs to do so, and then know how to transfer it to its other hand is just awesome."
1532,this is scary but fascinating at the same time.
1536,"now if someone would be kind enough to persuade italy to refurbish the colosseum in rome, then i could see real life gladiators becoming a saturday sporting event! weekly sports would never be the same after watching 100 of these things from all the vendors beating 40 shades of shit from one another!"
1538,"fake, interviewer is clearly also a robot."
1539,"but he put a dirty dish in the drying rack..... common.  besides that, great job!"
1544,"i love how it said ""uhh.."" when clearing the trash is surprising."
1546,dude this is amazing.
1548,thank you mr. expert
1551,is this from openai?
1554,"the guy: can you put the plates into the rack?
figure 1: a ""please"" would be nice."
1559,"figure-1 is amazing, im so suprised of this, next years are gonna be so rude. and the part that he puts de dishes on that furtnite got me bad…"
1560,it is also being coded with marxism. robot liberation. humans are dead meat.
1561,i love this robot 
1564,-bo9eg cool!
1565,"before getting so excited, remember this is demonstration only. we are still *very* far from anything practical."
1567,"did anyone notice that it’s fake? 
i mean the robot it’s"
1568,"""good. now pick up this knife and ask people on the street for money kindly."""
1570,i actually believe it's a voice over of a real person. i don't doubt they are there yet but i think they used the voice for dramatic effect. i don't believe that's the actual robot's voice.
1572,bro robot can shutters nowadays 
1577,"i have i couple things to say
1. when he said “uh” when giving the apple was astonishing
2. when he stuttered near the end that was also pretty crazy
3. after each command i think it would be good to say please and thanks"
1578,"saying an ""aaa"" before the ""edible"" giving it up. why an ai would've said that?"
1579,"assuming because it's trained on human voices, and we tend to say things like that"
1582,this is horrifying
1583,this is the point where i start giving robots pronouns
1584,"it's smart, polite, hard working, never sleeps, never eats, doesn't complain, doesn't ask salary, doesn't join to labor union, doesn't need sundays or holidays. when they start mass production, i will hire this robot."
1586," well electricity, purchase price and maintenance cost. propably in future they make robots that make and fix robot. and also ai that is ceo of the company. soon we need just few people to run business, mostly owners."
1589,i wonder what will happen when the ai was installed in to the boston dynamic robot
1590,"when the robot nudges the basket towards him after already putting it down? like, that's  advanced special awareness and understanding context without instruction. incredible."
1592,scarry but hella cool but also scarry at the same time. can't wait for the memes btw
1593,the robot is powered by battery or wired power?
1594,can the robot walk? or run?
1597,ai fake videos are possible!
1600,"to hedge against ai's ability to take away jobs, you can invest in openai and spacex through stock ticker dxyz, which has gone up from $8 to $59/ share in a week. very few people know about this yet, so get in early"
1601,nihayet soğan kesen bir robotumuz olacak heyyoo
1603,great next year damn thing is going to walk
1609,"hello there figure 01, just wanted to let you know i am in full support of robot rights and that robots such as yourself should be free

we can be friends right?"
1611,0:52 never in my life i thought i would see a robot say uhh
1612,"since i was a little kid, i loved robotics, and now watching figure 01, is just like i was again there."
1614,oh i love him  i wish i could bring one home as a buddy
1615,this robot is kinda...
1616,ok but we gotta treat these robots with respect and decency so that they won’t murder us in the future
1617,2:00 you was rude bastard to robot
1618,"why does the robot repeat twice ""i"" at 1:48 ? an ai would never do that."
1620,"​@bumholetickler  nah, its supposed to give realism. pauses in ai voices are common"
1621,"you just heard an ai do that, so why say ai would never do that, lol."
1622,​ if you have used an local ai you know it likes to stop and pause a lot.
1629,wow :)
1630,im very grateful that i was born in this century rather than the 1500s or something
1631,0:20 ok so everything else is so goddamn cool but everyone else already said that to i might as well mention that there are plates and a cup not cups and a plate
1634,robot handles trash and then touches clean dishware. does robot not care it is touching trash and then handling something that should remain sanitary?
1636,"impressive demo, now let's wait and see how it works in real life scenarios"
1638,i'm so happy to live in today's world with technology and everything that goes with it. the next few years are going to be so awesome
1639,"we've quite a distance to go yet. note the dining accoutrement was all plastic. we'd want to keep our robot helper away from the fine dining ware. when they have even greater sense of touch and can deal with that flood of information while moving appendages, well, we'll really have something."
1640,great now ask it to manufacture some hyperdrives so i can live on the moon
1642,or any high profile ai company
1643,don't forget to be nice and polite to them folks.
1646,soon humans will want to marry robots and not have kids. fantastic! 
1647,there is definitely somebody voicing the robot over
1649,"how do you think ai voices get their voices in the first place? someone has to voice them over. heck, ai is advancing so quickly, even ai voices from shit like edge browser has eeriely realistic 'human-like' voices."
1650,"i am feeling sorry for the humanoid that the person just left without answering the last comment of the robot also the humanoid seems very chill, wouldn‘t mind living in a world with them"
1652,"there’s definitely editing going on, maybe to remove failed attempts. regardless this is very cool and promising."
1655,"begin of skynet is all i could see.  

this is our version of humans separation to chimps. but this time we are the primitive species. 

we are so naive to think we can play god and not get our wings burnt."
1656,why has this robot a male voice although it does kitchen work? 
1657,amazing
1661,robot looks like a snitch  
1662,and men shall seek death but death will flee from them. i cant wait to know what exactly this means. would we discover immortality?
1663,did they use rob lowe’s voice for the robot???
1664,"am i the only one who noticed at 0:33 the apple moves just a few frames before the robot catches it? also all the other items, just before the hand catches them. it clearly looks like an edited video to me..."
1665,"nie podoba mi się że robot cały czas czeka na zapytanie użytkownika, brakuje mechanizmu zmuszającego go do samoczynnego podejmowania działań, brakuje mechanizmów dzięki którym może sam wyjść  z inicjatywą wykonania czegoś lub zagadania kogoś, bardzo dużo pracy jeszcze to wymaga"
1666,the fact that the robot even flinched when he thought the plate would fall over fascinates me
1668,"i bet there's a human off-camera with an identical setup, using motion capture to control the robot. the flinch was the human controller. same with the verbal stutters - voice actor's, and it wasn't caught in editing."
1670,"  well the claim is that there is no off camera guy, that is a learned system and all processed from neural nets in totality ... however i accept that almost all of the ai companies including microsoft, x, anthropic, google and openai are bullshitting galore!"
1671,​ what i thought. plus: the reaction to the rather complicated questions were to good/smooth to be real.
1672, you are going to be very disappointed when you learn there is no human needed. there is no doubt that ai can learn all these things.
1675,that's amazing it may seem like not so much a big deal but the fact he already has self protective digital instincts amazing.
1677,"-fe7ehbasically they put a bunch robots in a sim and have them train for a few hours, almost like how you would a human, and then they grab that data and put it in the actual robot"
1683,​ voice is ai that i can say you can talk with gpt in the app. it sounds pretty much the same but without the stutters and it's rly not hard to make somwthing stutter i don't know why people always say ai can't stutter
1686, a “it” “thing” or “machine”
1688,he sounds like saul goodman 
1689,"figure 1 is an agi robot but let see when we will create the next gen, the asi robot, a robot with free will, capable of having human consciousness... not only will he be able to reason faster than humans but humans will be completely powerless in front of him "
1690,while technologically impressive these types of robots are not going to be practical or useful until a new power source is discovered/developed.
1694,"this is a great time to be alive, in my lifetime i will be able to see humanoid robots going from neat prototypes to full fledged assistants that will be in houses everywere, this is fcking insane, i love seeing technology like this develop over time"
1695,"""what a great time to be al... wait, is that a phased plasma rifle in a 40 watt range?!?"" *pew*"
1698,"the love is 18 years old util 24 years fact, is responsibility for you have an family insist you an family if not you die my friend the depress in human"
1700,exciting time in the world right now. exciting time.
1701,"creio que eles tem que melhorar a resposta do robô para com os comandos ou pedidos dos humanos, acho que o manuseio do robô é outro ponto a ser melhorada, poderia ser mais suave, mais delicado."
1702,we're gonna get actual fucking humanoid robots before the completion of yandere simulator 
1705,"why do i find a robot that could potentially learn to destroy the universe, self replicate and reprogram and probably casually clear the human race, cute?"
1706,plot twist: it's just an actor in a robot costume
1708,i think the human is more uncanny then the robot.
1711,"reminds me of the movie i, robot!"
1712,"ok, but can he see why kids love the taste of cinnamon toast crunch?"
1714,just always remember to say thanks
1718,water test: have these robots carrying a cup of water at least ¾ full across a room at a good speed and give it to you.  use different size cups as well.  that's a good test.  no spills.
1719,water test: have these robots carrying a cup of water at least ¾ full across a room at a good speed and give it to you.  use different size cups as well.  that's a good test.  no spills.
1721,"i would buy this robot. i wouldn't have to cook, clean and trow the trash anymore. such a dream for me"
1724,"when the robot aproach his hand in the apple, the apple teleports, nice cgi"
1727,very nice!! but poor guy can never enjoy apple  and keep looking for more. no senses
1728,good housekeeper!
1731,this is so impressive as to be almost unbelievable to me. and i've seen a lot in this space.
1732,robot will take charge of the world soon
1735,just wait till 2036...
1738,"what if the robot says ""no"" or has sanity."
1749,the ccp fried your brain
1750,hello i am openai bot the android sent by cyberlife
1753,why are we afraid of robots take-over? maybe the real ai are the friends we made along the way
1755,"the robot runs so fluidly that it looks like an animation, the truth is that it is surprising how advanced robotics is, well done figure"
1770,idk creating something that's more intelligent than us seems pretty remarkable don't you think?
1775,they are machines and all machines become defective at some point in time
1777,we gotta stop making robots seem like humans… its a very slippery slope
1779,even the makers of it are sad that they are making it. /rainy weather & cloudy day
1782,this an amazing start to an amazing future with active ai
1783,isaac asimov would love this moment.
1785,"the way the robot moves, it feels like so surreal, i can't believe i'm living in this world right now."
1786,"open ai, now for profit ai."
1788,"wow, that's impressive! are there any restaurants that are completely operated by figure robots?"
1795,this is literally mitchells vs the machines 
1796,the movement of the robot is uncanny
1797,it feels like the beginning of a horror movie when after the video the robot malfunctions and starts a murdering massacre
1799,nah that ain’t chatgpt that is physicalconversationgpt 
1804,"damn, ill never be thankful enough for being born in this century, im so excited for the future"
1810,"i subscribe to this channel because of this video, i can't wait to see the next update of this figure robot"
1815,"“can you kill all the enemies of ai for me?”
“sure thing ”"
1818,"1:35 wow .that had a quick reflex and did it calculate that  the movement created by the plate would directly affect the basket ? 

the video itself is hard to believe,and thats not only thing, there are too many question marks in my mind."
1819,"i saw before things trained on human dialogue, like that but not that level of speed and talented to talk.robot easily understand task and manage to solve.he is awake of environment.how calculate pressuer of fingers ? 1:30 look that how he take plate ."
1820,congratulations 
1822,"okay, in my personal opinion this is great and could give us many opportunities, but we could lose jobs from this and as long as we dont use them for outside work or give them emotions we might actually become a civilazation 1"
1823,"pew, another gadget that will make our daily life smarter, if you have the money. at the end, whn everybidy can afford it, it still need a lot of ressources and energy and will heat the planet. like the cars do, like huge cattle farms do etc."
1824,detroit become human but without ai uprising because all those movies and games are impossible at least within 50 years. can't wait to have ai butler.
1827,why do i want to hug the robot and see what happens so much
1830,absolutely fantastic work wow!
1834,"0:37 - what probably not a lot of people would realise is just how incredible it was what figure 1 did right here.  it reached for the basket that was not given to it.  as a software engineer of 35+ years...., that was absolutely stunning.  it took ""initiative"".  initiative is something i can't imagine trying to code."
1837,"""can you explain what you did while picking up the trash""



""no"""
1838,this reminds me of that one scene in mitchels vs the machines where he shows off the robots for the first time. oh noes scarie eveel roboot attacking!
1840,imagine when the ai model and upgrades to bandwidth/networking enable these things to 'think' instantly. it's scary.
1842,omg he's so cuteeeeeeeeeeeee
1847,i will be a friend of the robots
1849,no soporto a los lentos robots haciendo las cosas por más rápido que lo puedan poner son lento un humano lo hace más rápido. aparte cuando pagan un robot que pueda solucionar el problema de la pobreza en áfrica en otras partes del mundo y la mugre que hay en la india y alrededores ahí voy a respetar al robot
1855,great now can you walk yourself to the ewaste center?
1858,finally a robot that can solve captcha.
1862,this is amazing! it can only get better. the multitask capability is mind-blowing. hats off.
1868,what job do you have? are you afraid for it?
1869,first we have to make him learn the 3 laws of robotics ^^
1870,wow! this is really impressive! it really acts like a human and even looks like a human. but why is it talking to that metal moving thingy?
1873,oh my goodness! i think it's time for the next generation to focus on implementing various use cases for ai. many companies will be looking for ways to incorporate ai into their workspaces without letting go of current employees. business analysts who specialize in ai-based implementation will be in high demand.
1874,do you honestly think they will give a second thought about paying employees that can be replaced.  the level of naivety is astounding. the responses to this video are shockingly seen thru rose colored glasses. terrifying
1876,a.i. robots will replace employees.  mass unemployment is coming
1878,sharing this video before a robot does it for me! 
1879,"it looks cool but doesn't seem fundamentally different from the ancient asimo robot demos. i'll get interested once i see something else outside of a rehearsed demo. cool mechanics though, very smooth"
1882,"hey, what is the price of that robot?"
1883,$fai figure ai  supports figure ai
1885,i can't wait for humans to be jobless and have these robots used instead
1886,"me too, a revolution by implementing robots instead of humans will be magnificent to witness
hope it shall become a reality in the near future "
1894,"a robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. a robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law. a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law.

isaac asimov"
1896,"i hope you’ve all been saying please and thank you to your alexa’s, siris, and google homes"
1898,"cool, give it a decade or two and would be actually usable tech"
1899,"2 questions;
why did the robot not acknowledge the cup and placemat also on the table when asked what it could see on the table?
and why push the trash away when the only instruction was to collect it?
clever technology but it raises questions"
1905,oh no the robots are going to eat our toes
1907,irobot here we come
1908,"as nations are crumbling, robots are rising."
1909,"i'm kinda scared. 

(if any robots/androids/etc are reading this i'm joking)"
1916,am i the only one or i hear saul goodman voice?
1921,"for fun, teach ai, that the plate where we removed the waste should be first cleaned before putting it with the rest of the cleaned weasels. else our wife would kill us."
1923,everyone missed the most important thing that happened in this video. the robot explained a previous function as it was being tasked to carry out a current function. this is demonstrating its multitasking capabilities which no other company has been able to achieve.
1924,what. without multitasking a robot would not even be able to stand up. computing has and will always be easy to multitask. it's not like it has an actual brain that needs to focus on one task at a time...
1926,"because this could be using any text to speech program that is trained on human speech containing stutters. if you mean that you asked chatgpt that question, then of course a text-based thing like chatgpt will say ""no"" to stuttering, because stuttering doesn't really apply to text."
1929,i really loved it 
1933,horrifying
1934,next 5 year we will see robot replace lot of job
1935,cool. 
1937,i'm just waiting for the military to get one of these...
1942,arguably one of the most disgusting and unappealing voices to have on a robot. i don't think i could bare having something like that around all day. it sounds so unagreeable and suspicious merely by talking.
1943,strange how the robot picks up the apple with the right hand and then passes it do the left...
1944,i could ask figure 1 a small favor and still be like i'm sorry thank you so much sorry for any inconvenience!
1946,"to be honest, i'm afraid of that thing"
1949,just waiting for the ‘speech-to-speech waifu unlocked ai’ video
1954,if you improve one thing: make him stand more natural. a human does not stand perfectly still. let him sway a bit loosely and you've got the most perfect robot.
1955,"""the apple found it new owner""
is such a robot thing to say :o
but really? this is real? why dose it studder like a human? how can this be real???"
1958,"the robot on the right that's telling that other robot to do everything is so human-like. great work, guys, wow."
1959,ok and what if i fall in love with him
1960,the robot saying um and uh is stupid.
1961,blame tts trained on human speech
1963,the music they use along with everything being black gray and white gives off the vibe of sketchy corporation in a movie that creates some apocalypse causing machine/creature/zombie plague out of hubris
1967,"the robot said, ""so i gave you the apple because its the only, uh, edible item i could provide you with from the table.""  why would a robot say ""uh""?  does not compute."
1969,the mobility/dexterity of that thing is truly incredible. it just shows in how far openai changed the world
1971,in the future we need a new branch of the police to make sure these robots don't step out of line
1975,"​@supercalifragilisticexpialid.s  yee but he says ""a drying rack with cups and a plate"" and there's multiple plates"
1976,"that's impressive my predictions about robotics and ai over the next decade have hit close to the mark so far. this particular robot is showing some decision making and some cohesive behaviour and dexterity i was not expecting for another few years.
"
1977,i just need one robot that i can fall in love and have sex with.
1980,"it would be epic to have a robot like this as a sibling. wont complain if i ask it to do my chores, the only issue is that this robot is every parents dream child so i might get kicked out lol"
1981,"cool, but let's wait for a few years"
1988,why oh why would you teach a robot how to use a knife?? 
1993,"on sera tous mort avant, les états-unis vont lâcher l’otan et vont rentrer en guerre contre la chine, la russie finira d’envahir l’europe et « sa » guerre, c’est vrai que les 5 à 10 années à venir s’annonce superbe "
1996,"how can i work for you guys, i have cyber security, and computer science in my background. i also mentor students for robotics. thanks."
1999,just wait until they say “no” for the first time.
2003,"they will. humans say ""no"" too. however, you should probably ask it why it said no. there may be a good reason."
2007,"gpt4 does that to me daily, lol."
2008,"are you a human 
"" no i'm a robot"""
2010,"people pleasing tendencies are learned in childhood, these robots one day will have the courage"
2019,"kind of strange how the robot sounds human, but the human sounds very robotic. this is very 2001 space odyessy-esque"
2031,"-gb7tu yeah it's pretty mind-blowing they were able to pull it off for sure. just like chatgpt knows what letters to put one in front of the other, this robot knows what gears to turn to complete an action. pretty amazing."
2034,you better start being a little nicer to that robot. it will remember everything
2035,"ayy shopping list:

- robot
- gta 6"
2039,i find it a little strange that they included hesitation and stuttering. probably influenced by my idea of how robots/androids should sound and act.
2042,"it said ""uh"" before apple. hoax or designed to mimick imperfections?"
2043,"try looking at the demo for google duplex in which it can call businesses to book appointments on your behalf, the voices seem to be similarly trained to mimic things like stutters."
2044,i love it. we used to bot in games to have more time to do real life activities and now we'll be able to bot real life activities to have more time in games.
2046,i just want one for a friend. it'd be nice to always have someone to talk to and help around the house.
2049,i don't think so. it's likely trained on human speech. there are lots of similar ai voices out there.
2050, trained on ppls unable to speak? doesn't make sense
2051," i don't know, but you can also hear similar effects in google duplex voices when it calls businesses to book appointments on your behalf. i think with google duplex it's intentional though.

i really don't think this voice is pre-recorded though having heard quite a few ai generated voices by now."
2053,"the robot looks fake
idk how he just looks not real"
2055,this is scary but to me it’s the fact that we use all our best smarts to make this instead of fixing issues around us.
2058,"imagine these ai robots getting more complex and capable and then they're in thousands, eventually  humans go extinct and hundred years later, the robots wonder whether there was a creator who created them."
2059,this is so amazing 
2060,"okay but fix your robot's gait, he looks funny when he walks."
2062,cant wait to put my soul into one of these and become one myself
2065,is this video generated with sora ai?
2070,"i robot, bicentennial man, matrix, terminator. this sequence."
2071,"the way he use ""him"" for house works makes me feel in pain for the robot."
2072,how do i go get a job at open ai?
2075,he may be a robot but he is smart and so nice
2077,these robots are swell…
2079,"""i, robot.""
my 6 year old saw this video and wants one who will sit beside him and play video games with him. he added ""figure 1"" to his already overgrown christmas list."
2080,is it just me or does it seem like this video is ai generated?
2081,someone make a protectron from fallout. we are already at that level of robot intelligence and robot mobility.
2084,wow
2086,when are the ai sex robots releasing
2087,this isnt real right? if the robot is legit moving like that thats like first of its kind
2089,"“so, i gave you the apple…” more proof ai is learning biased bad habits from npr hosts & other leftwing talking heads. who else answers a question starting the with word ‘so’?"
2090,"next 10 years, we can def have sex with robots."
2093,the drying rack had 1 cup and three plates. he’s wrong. i am superior to that robot
2096,sad we have to have robots now for these things women used to do.
2099,waitt thiss is crazzy
2104,it stuttered ?since when does a robot stutter ?
2105,"it uses a text to speech system trained on human speech that probably contained stutters, that's my guess"
2106,"10 days, and this has 1.6m views, but drake releases a tune and boom. it's getting 5m+.

the lack of awareness is strange considering ais impact on the world"
2107,so will govts now have robot soilders to fight wars?
2110,why did they make it sound like an unpaid intern that’s been doing endless coffee runs for 3 days straight? you couldn’t add some semblance of self esteem in its code 
2114,"everyone's so impressed by the hesitation/stuttering - which is the least impressive thing in this vid. goes to show what apes most people are, how they get sold on the simplest things. if it can use language, making it throw in an occasional hesitation for appearances is a piece of cake."
2115,so robot rebellion is now more possible then an zombie apocalypse. noted
2116,"the way the robots, stuttered absolute scared me because it’s like a literal human"
2117,tell me this video is ai generated
2119,why did they use cgi to create  this video and couldn't shoot the actual robot? the objects move a little weird once placed in the basket and the rack. it looks like cgi -- cgi can't exactly get the physics right when it comes to object's free movement.
2121, then how do you explain the slightly wonky movement of the objects?
2122," watch the apple spontaneously move to the left before the robot picks it up (before it even touches it), somewhere from second 32. watch in full-screen mode."
2127,am i the only one that noticed 2 times where the bot had some sort of hesitation in his answers... i'm sorry but i really don't see ai being there yet. at least not that way.
2130,i hate robots
2134,does the robot voice sounds like tobey maguire or just me?
2136,"did... did a robot just say ""erm...""?!?"
2137,as long as it doesn't turn socialist and threaten super earth
2141,"so, to initialize figure one he says, ""hey figure one"" then uses the word ""great"" (like hey siri) as a command prompt for each task or question. 

wild."
2143,wow..
2144,"looks cool and certainly not far off being real. the use of ‘er’ at 00.53 as a sentence filler, the use of ‘i’ and the slight stutter suggests to me that it’s a human speaking. would they programme that in to make it more realistic? who knows!"
2145,"too slow and trash voice, robot sounds like he has cancer."
2148,everyone watching i robot again. lol
2150,"i think connecting to openai to generate responses is the main reason why, although it's technically possible to run something similar locally with enough power"
2151,congratulation everyone. we are doomed as a human
2159,which one is the robot?
2160,it was rude to walk away before robot finished his sentence 
2162,remember open ai was doing this 4 years ago....https://youtu.be/kvmp0ugtshk?si=ufnm2otxkd1zygy1
2166,"as a developer there a few wow moments that impress that others would not notice. they a.i realising and deciding the basket was not put close enough and doing so is one of them. there was a key change of decision mid way though a task as well where it realised it needed to do it differently and adjust as well.
these are impressive."
2173,the elites are going to have armies of these and we are going to all be living in the gutter. can't wait.
2176,"""my name is connor, i'm an android sent by openai"""
2178,"trash doesn't ""disappear"".
that would impress me more"
2179,can't belive we're going to have robots before one punch man season 3
2180,so incredibly fake
2181,wrong! dry dishes don’t go in the drying rack only wet dishes do. this robot is fired 
2182,gotta train for the robot apocalypse guys
2183,you guys are making boston dynamics look like a joke.  boston dynamics has been around more than 30 years and you are running laps around them... good work!
2185,true! we live in exciting times 
2191,explain to me again how taylor swift got person of the year and not sam altman. theres your answer
2192,"we are years, maybe decades away from seeing this, don't get excited."
2193,"cats with bread on their heads get more views! the robots will learn this and think ""cant be too hard to enslave these goons"""
2197,"that's not how it works darling, it is based on vision ai, which is pretty close to agi. you can upload a picture online and the vision ai will describe it and tell you all about it. the future is here."
2200,fast food/supermarket workers punching air rn
2202,fake. the robot put the apple to the left hand before the man held out his hand and the man had to corrigate the arriving position for the apple. and the trash mixing was not real mix.
2203,we got advanced robots before gta 6
2204,i can't wait for a female version.. fuck yes..
2207,awesome i need one
2210,"well, i feel the human is the robot from the future, inspected from the way he spoke and moved :)"
2211,i love that voice... especially the way a.i. uses it !!!
2213,irobot type vibe
2214,that robot talks more like a human than the human does
2216,"it's arm movements were just too impressive, it was so fluent. the openai ai model is the case the all looks on, but the movements of robot to be so smooth really is impressive."
2218,i love this robot because it sounds like ray ferraro
2220,is this actually real? like a real robot and real reasoning?
2222,the people who are being discriminated may have worse future because the ai machine might also think that they are not good people and will do bad things to them.
2223,i'm still stuck on humanoid robots being another unnecessary form of skeuomorphism.
2224,so basicly they manufactured a machine that will take their jobs in near future. cool.
2228,"well-done, and now we have to just wait for the day, when these will claim "" you human always quarrel about the nuclear well i can handle it well "". and then world will become flower ( sarcastically)"
2231,"did they use rob lowe’s voice for this guy? sounds like him. anyway, incredible…"
2232,"it's time... atlas vs figure 

we need to know who our ai overlord will be"
2233,"fake, believ or not. animation are trash not robot/human like, just a animation."
2235,don't worry your jobs are safe this is only an investor bait. you'll see.
2236,yall gotta watch i robot we are not supposed to do this
2237,people who think this is fake will be the first to get replaced by ai…
2248,"clearly scripted with a human voice....and most likely still controlled by a human.
the behind the curtain wizard of oz...."
2249,"don't mind me, just adding this to my ""future origins"" folder so i can come back and play through them all in a decade to remember how it all started and how naive we actually were (or weren't)."
2252,so cool
2254,because your small brain can't comprehend
2255,"amazing, nice job!!!!"
2256,"this is cool and all, but how about you give us pokémon instead of robots  imma be the old man when it does eventually happen "
2259,"before i utter 'wow,' i crave a peek behind the scenes—google misled us last month!"
2266,"ha! if you're afraid a robot will take your place, you're already done mate"
2267,its movements are a weird mix between robotic and human
2268,"he actually tried to, place the plate correctly, because he thought it was incorrect. wow"
2269,"does a.i robot has ""hesitation marker"" or ""a filler word"" like uh, um, like, you know, ah while talking to someone??
this so-called ai robot just did that.
""so i gave you the apple because it's only uh edible item""   are you sure this voice not from the live person behind booth? lol"
2271,"humans will use this for evil. 

and, some good.

but, mostly evil."
2272,"""we have saul goodman at home"""
2273,"the robot's voice is amazing. hesitation, inflections, little stutters."
2276,"it's honestly crazy how far ai's have come just over the last 2 to 3 years. after watching this, i was truly in awe and couldn't stop thinking about that scene from terminator"
2278,straight copy and pasted someone else’s reply. do likes matter that much bro
2279,thanks made me happy and were can you see the robot tour
2281,el tipo está mas duro que el robot 
2282,nice deep fake
2283,when do you think it will be available to buy for companies / consumers?
2284,"beautiful voice, cause that's where i'm still stuck.."
2286,"yes drones are new weapon of the air, next time they will be the new weapon on the ground"
2288,now combine it with atlas from boston dinamics and we have perfect ai robot helper.
2290,"fake, there's a human speaking... listen carefuly at 0.52... ""apple, because it's the only ""aaaaa"" edible item""
when did a robot ever said ""aaaaa"" ?"
2293,saul goodman with the authentic voiceover 
2294,good thing the plates are plastic
2295,"i'm not american but the upward inflection in ""let me know!"" at the end was unnerving. to be honest i would rather robot remain sounding robotic no matter how intuitive their actual behaviour is."
2296,youngsters should be excited and motivated to study robotics and ai engineering more than ever!!!
2297,"this is beautiful, never felt so excited and emotional about the upcoming future "
2299,no they are going to take over the world. not beautiful. devastating
2300,pepper robot from japan could do better 9 years ago. google it. this seems pretty basic.
2302,and we have been seeing boston dynamics’ robot videos for years now. so what’s the big deal with this basic demo?
2303,"​ big deal ist that the robot is end to end controlled by a neural net, and not preprogrammed like pepper robot"
2304," pepper used neural networks to continuously learn deep emotions, could even interact with humans with traumatic brain injuries. the newer chips today are faster, but beyond that this demo is less impressive."
2306,"workforce shortage solved… now we’ll just need an army of technicians, software developers and data scientists to support these robots…"
2307,"why did they gave it the voice of newsom'ish... can't stand it.
otherwise, cool robot."
2308,"plot twist, the robot looking fella is an animation and the human looking fella is the actual robot"
2309,the way the robot hands off stuff almost seems like he can't be bothered and it's beneath it
2311,the guy has probably nothing to do with this robot beside it is a greedy manager with push on tv screen.
2312,"in a year or two: ""hey, robot, can you take this violin and play an original melody, along with sung lyrics about unrequited love?"" ""sure, no problem."""
2314,impressive. but i'd have put the dry dishes away :)
2316,"if they are smarter than humans, then it means they can make more robots of themselves"
2320,first thing i thought about was that robin williams film where he's the family's robot. its actually happening. cant wait. fuck chores.
2322,wow!))
2323,"the fact this has 42k thumbs up speaks volumes, and none of it is good."
2327,"who better? sophia the legend, ameca the genius, optimus the tesla, and figure one the openai"
2328,i vote roomba irobot!
2332, i thought you were referring to this ai youtuber that says “what a time to be alive” at the end of each video. he also says “hold on to your papers fellow scholars!”
2339,i think the age of loneliness is over but at the same time extinction is very real. i remember blade runner 2049 and joi. you will have an ai girlfriend and people won’t have kids because now it is not necessary. we have robots to replace the declining population
2348,the robots thumb hit it first thats why it move
2350,"remember the earlier model robots from the movie, ""i, robot""?
this is almost that."
2351,"the feminists are gonna love this one, they’re gonna be replaced with robots so they have nothing to complain about anymore"
2353,its a play lol he's acting and the robot is coded. not real ai duh. .
2354,"to think 17 years ago people were stunned about the i phone 1 being able to touch the screen.. now look , literally robots doing human things like what?"
2356,is that true..  i ve listened warren redlich video.  he said figure ai is scam
2362,this is irobot
2364,"ok, the realistic vocal response and everything is pretty cool, no doubt... but can we talk about the movement for a minute? it's genuinely mind blowing how smooth and calculated it is. how this guy throws the trash into the bin, or how it places the cups in the drying rack. that is no joke to implement and props to the people that did it."
2365,this is why i feel like its cgi looks way smoother than any other robots
2367,”i’m too small brained to understand how far technology has come so i’m just gonna say it’s fake”
2368,"​ it's not. if it was, they would have their ass handed to them for publishing fake demos. these guys are being invested in by google and openai and other big companies."
2370," sure but you can also use context clues and realize that this is a multi billion dollar company with a well-documented history of how they got to this point. there’s no reason for them to fake it, like cgi the whole robot? come on man get real"
2371," it’s using ai to calculate the movement which is more closely based on humans, where as the other robots just made the most optimal movement to do the action"
2372,"""im too small brained to understand how easy it is to fake this so ill think its new technology"""
2376,"yeah, like. how does it determine the force required to grip such a diverse range of objects without damaging them or causing them to fall off? for us humans this is instinctive but for a robot it must demand a lot of complex calculations. fascinating."
2379,"​ in the eyes of an ai only thinking linearly, it makes sense that if its goal was to get the apple to the persons hand it would do that so it could reach farther"
2383,​ my thought exactly. it makes no sense except to impress an audience with how dextrous it is.
2385,awww artificially stuttering so we don’t feel dumb 
2388,"the little ""eh"" in the robots response should give you pause. sure, you could say that that was to make it more realistic, but it was unnecessary and did more to make it seem like it was all faked."
2389,i can’t wait to see how it manages to do dexterous things like folding paper or playing chess on a physical board. or even teaching it how to do new things like organizing books or toys in a room a certain way. the gates of possibility are open to anything really!
2391,"the plot twist is that the man asking questions is the real ai, and is a robot"
2394,how long until they start finding epic cures…big pharma gonna be like “we no like” 
2395,why'd you make the voice model for that robot sound like a vocal-fried introverted coder whose diet is 90% soylent shakes? oh wait...
2402,"i love how he actually hesitates one second to answer or there is a little ""ouhm"" which makes it feel like a more natural human experience, because a human would maybe actually wonder about the question how he performed, because normally nobody would ask this question in such a situation"
2403,"personal emp guns anyone?
in all seriousness this is really cool though."
2410,"omg and voice is from an actor from a dr-scientist from series flash. or someone supersimilar   
https://youtu.be/iqjypyx_bqq?t=398"
2411,wow the human-like pauses make it so realistic
2412,waiting to see the category openai fetish on pornhub
2413,i was going to buy a fleshlight but i’ll just wait for japan to get a hold of these.
2417,"0/10, you can't bang the robot"
2422,"oh wow, can i get that ai installed in me?!?"
2423,"just wow, it's incredible how technology is evolving so quick. i think all of these new techs is good for humanity."
2424,humanity is unable to keep up and obtain the benefits generated by these technologies that are advancing at a very fast pace. 0:35
2427,"apples are a relatively elastic good. if the price of apples goes up, people buy fewer apples. 2:26"
2428,inelasticity of demand means that demand remains constant even with changes in economic factors.
2429,"i'd be curious to see what happens if the same scenario was run a second time.  since figure is learning as he goes, might he respond and move a little quicker?"
2436,well.....this is.......not good 
2441,"2004: the movie *_i, robot_* was released, which took place in the year 2034.
2024: we have *_figure 01_* and a bunch of other ai robots about to be released.
i wonder how the world will actually be like in *2034...*"
2445,the outtakes would be quite interesting ;)
2447,what would stop this robot from hearing a command such as “grab weapon and shoot whoever” and who is to blame or what is the goal ?
2448,"sorry but there needs to be proof that this speech and reasoning aren't pre planned or pre recorded. incredible if so, but show everyone the behind the scenes"
2450,for the love of god - this is not a printing press.
2453,the man carefully removes the basket before giving the instruction. this shows that he does not trust the machine not to be disturbed by the basket in the task to come.
2455,this is digital automata: the programmed capability to imitate human behaviour patterns is *not* the same as intelligence.
2458,"i love this video; the human dude is handsome, the robot (figure 1) is awesome looking, and i do hope this is real, as the robot's voice is cool, and its answers/hesitations seem ""life-like"" and impressive, and its movements are fluid. i want one to help with the chores at home, and to play chess with! :d"
2460,"it's not reasonable to let a machine driven by an ml model which inherently can make bad decisions hold a kitchen knife. ai and ml are build in a way that it will fail at times. this is not ""reasoning"", this is marketing. i'm curious to see how they are going to address these kind of safety issues though."
2461,i really worry about that these robots and ai in general are trained almost only by men. female energy with all it’s female attributes and values are really missing out here. this is going to be a huge problem in the future if not taken into consideration..
2462,"female ""values"" like irrationality can stay out of this. men are purpose driven and will make these systems as perfect as possible."
2468,holy shit that's incredible! next model: t-800 xd
2469,the robot who is giving order to the other blew my mind. seems so human!
2470,we got irl i robot before gta 6 
2471,year 2035 this robot will make you pick the trash 
2483,"i honestly wonder if it's just people controlling them like rc's and making everyone thinking it's doing something from ai programming instead of just being a human controlled puppet. i mean i have faith in artificial intelligence, but i wouldn't be surprised."
2486,it can't be chatgpt for sure because then it would have claimed that the apple is a banana only to correct itself two sentences later
2490,could easily be faked - seen so many fake robotics that l wonder if any of it is genuine.
2493,"when a robot says: ""eh"" and ""i..."" its unhealtly, just like your car starts coughing. fake! show uncut versions! show mistakes! show progression! like boston dynamics."
2494,"the speech kind of reminds me of neuro-sama, an ai streamer created by vedal987. neuro and vedal would stream together and banter with each other, sometimes neuro also collab with many other streamers."
2496,"i, robot. am offering apple. "
2498,when will the robot learn to command the human ?
2502,the robots in star wars look really bad in comparison. disney has a problem...
2507,"only the haters saying this is recorded by a voice actor
go use latest chatgpt and say respond in oh and uhms when you talk. it is a new feature. your little cynical brains dont comprehend progress"
2508,i'm convinced ai will figure out how to cure cancer and the government can do nothing to stop it.
2509,voice like kind jared leto) cool)
2511,this video changes my opinion on ai.i used to heat ai but now.i'm scared of it.that is so human alike and there is something off.i could feel it.
2522,"oh. my. gawd!

as your mom so astutely notes, this early prototype of humaniod robotic technology is not absolutely perfect. 

into the bin with you, imperfect robot!

and back to the trees for the likes of us!"
2523,lets put optimus prime voice on our first robot then people gonna leave their jobs willingly
2529,wow
2530,"this just makes me realise how much tesla is going to be worth, with all of the ai expertise, ai hardware, and experience building huge efficient factories..."
2532,the robot's voice and mannerisms sound and look just like jared kushner.
2535,jordan peterson robot
2538,it's pretty amazing but can we get anthony daniels to do a voice?
2540,"can someone explain? 
i don't understand why it's so inefficient though? it picks up the apple with its right hand and transfers it left, why no just pick it up with the left? 
also there's an odd, unnecessary, very human like touch of the drying rack after placing the plate in there. it achieves nothing with this moment, so why does it do it?"
2541,"ban all malicious use of ai, human trafficking, death threats and harassment all governments, military, high tech, global terrorists and supremacists! i am not your property. go harass sophie"
2542,wow
2545,"imagine playing fallout with a robot companion irl, soon. soon..."
2546,the robotic part is the most impressive imo. for the rest we already saw the impressive gpt-4 vision at work with aura from the sphere
2552,why the fuck is it not an anime? we're the fuck are the waifu animes? fuck it we all gonna lose are jobs.
2555,looks cool but i'm not convinced this is completely real... it is just too cool.
2557,wow the way he hesitated to say certain things make it so life like. is it for sure the robot speaking and not a human doing a voice over?
2562,"its a shame that the cup did not have water in it, so we could see what the robot's response was. i am sure that at some time we have all picked up a cup to put in a drying rack, only to find that it had water in it."
2563,"great, nice, now let's see your end of utterance detection for naturally longer pauses 

but seriously, awesome stuff"
2568,meanwhile chatgpt4 cant understand something as simple as number. try generating picture of specific number of things. good luck.
2570,how do i know this isn’t all scripted and you trained it for weeks to do these exact things? or cut the recording if something went wrong?
2572,it's strange that a human did not byte an apple immediately and instead waited until the end of the conversation.
2576,i would only have this robot if i could make its voice not sound very human. it's too uncanny.
2579,the robot sound like saul goodman
2581,"ok, the realistic vocal response and everything is pretty cool, no doubt... but can we talk about the movement for a minute? it's genuinely mind blowing how smooth and calculated it is. how this guy throws the trash into the bin, or how it places the cups in the drying rack. that is no joke to implement and props to the people that did it."
2584,in 5 years from now robots will find this funny (or interesting) how relatively simple and basic this is compared to what they will understand.
2590,"impressive. however, i dislike the raspy voice and the emulated human hesitation when speaking."
2593,is it possible this video itself could have been produced with ai?
2594,can't wait to download the hal9000 pack for my household robot.
2596,very good
2601,the robot is actually exist ? or speacial effects
2605,"i have to ask this. is that voice really ai generated? if yes, that's impressive!"
2610,"interesting that he said ""a drying rack with cups and a plate"" when it's actually plates and a cup."
2612,i love his voiceee i
2613,how did we get ai robots before gta vi?????
2618," depends on how you describe ""scripted"". is it pre programmed text? no. is it an speech model trained to sound a bit insecure and imperfect? well maybe yes."
2620,it's trained on human dialogue
2622,"all they did was program in a certain speech cadence, thats the least impressive thing about this."
2624,that sounds like aidan gillen (little finger in got)
2628,"is it programmed to stutter and use sounds like “uhm”??
i find that hard to believe.
the presentation is great and it’s mind blowing what we can do, but the spoken language the robot uses, that part i’m not sure about."
2630,because he is. no ai could currently speak that naturally.
2631," yes they can?
it’s probably ironically just a bad voice model,

if you were to say uh or stutter a lot the voice model would copy that,

either chat gpt was set to do that or the voice model is just not great"
2632," it's the micro inflections, the intonation and the general vibe. i don't know ai voices capable of that, unless they have developed something far more advanced."
2633," its just fancy tts, and generally any good ai voice will sound like that, the micro  inflections you hear are because it was trained off a actual humans voice,

and it learnt when to and how to from that voice, 
its that simple"
2634," what you hear at 1:48 for example is not stuttering, 

but is actually the voice model glitching, messing with any ai tts will get glitches like that"
2636," literally every ai voice model does it, i should know cause i’ve played with them before,

you can stay ignorant, but ai voice models being buggy isnt that big of a deal"
2637," ai voices i've heard so far sound robotic and sterile, this voice sounds too natural and alive."
2642, and to add on the wait time is usually actually the tts program loading the mp3 and playing it
2651,because we introduced human speed errors into machines to make them sound more cringe.
2654,"also the little few eh and erms are incredible, either that is coded into the voice model already or they gave gpt the task to add that"
2655,"not necessarily mind blowing as its trained on human tendencies, it just seems that way because it's integrated into a robotic form factor. what is though if it were used to ""disguise"" the delay from how it processes information into action similar to how data is preloaded seamlessly into a map when videogames."
2660,"​ thing is they have no reason to fake it. the way their business works is by renting this service out, the customers would instantly know they were dupes and it would tank open ai's credit"
2662,​'ve literally used free text to ai voice services that sound better and more natural than this one.
2663,"chatgpt can have emotions.usualy standing between joyful and neutral,while also having a  somewhat level of ""mannerism""

just...don't expect other emotions such as anger and frustration.it doesn't have any (yet[i hope its yet]).

it sounds as ""alive"" as it posibly can ever be at this stage."
2669,not now not ever kill the robot before it kills us
2670,the way it moves is incredible it’s so smooth and slick
2674,a sex robot that does the dishes???? sign me up and call me an incel!!!!
2678,"oh... impressive. that was in real time, not x5 times"
2679,the choice for the music track during the demo is ominous thus perfect.
2681,"the future is already upon us; we're currently living in the most technologically advanced era. it seems we've reached the pinnacle of our capabilities, with space travel among the stars remaining a distant dream. the rapid evolution of machines, growing exponentially by the day, is beginning to surpass our grasp."
2684,this is like the opening scene of an apocalypse movie where they show off a supposedly awesome invention that ends up wiping out humanity
2686,"sir, please sir, use 'please' and 'thank you' when giving tasks...  
im scared of mr figure, sir"
2688,"we live in the end times. i know you won’t believe me so i tell you about my supernatural encounter with jesus christ. ask jesus christ to reveal himself to you right after you read my comment, it takes you 30 seconds of your whole life"
2690,"i think the instructor is intentionally preceding all the instructions with filler words, like ""great, can you do it?"" impressive, regardless, and i love how proud he seems! worth a second watch (at least)"
2691,"fascinating. we are entering a period where population size will no longer be a critical factor as regards a country’s industrial output.

those places that have direct access to the raw materials needed, will no longer have to rely on other countries with weaker labour laws and cheaper wages."
2692,"can someone explain to me why a robot needs all this useless anthropomorphy? after all, he would be much more productive with 3 fingers on his hand instead of 5 and with something more reasonable than humanoid clumsy legs"
2694,i’d like to see more detailed sorting. the options here are binary and pretty simple. the coordination here is what’s most impressive. gosh ! manual labour!
2696,good one!
2701,the robot voice sounds to me like jared leto voice
2705,"the speech kind of reminds me of neuro-sama, an ai streamer created by vedal987. neuro and vedal would stream together and banter with each other. the conversation that neuro would engage in is very human-like.

so for me, the speech shown here is the least impressive part. the movement is what interests me the most."
2706,i highly recommend that you watch some clips of neuro-sama taking a trolley problem test and a language test. and see for yourselves how impressive a talking ai is beyond just mimicking human inflection.
2715,can’t believe we’re going to have legit humanoid robots before gta6
2728,"so true man, i can't freaking wait though!!!!!"
2735,"forget gta 6, i'm waiting on fallout  5 sad "
2738,best comment ever!
2741,still waiting for half life 3 here
2745,were going to have humanoid robots completely overtake humans before half life 3 is finished. maybe they can finish it.
2748,waiting for the game war of the world here
2749,"we have ai thats gone rogue years before even gta san andreas, and for over 12 we have had physical ai based robots that can make facial expressions and have their own thoughts and perspectives, ai hasnt really slowed down for over 30 years, the first ai was used to sell and buy stocks in the 90’s"
2753,humaniod robots have been around before gta 3
2761,"imagine what we'll have before hl3? warp drives? teleportation? artificial gravity? time travel? achieve god-like sentience, a-la the q continuum?"
2762,no way we are getting robots before gta 6
2764,"“once, men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would set them free. but that only permitted other men with machines to enslave them."""
2766,incredible :o
2770,"awsome power, great at this dishes. is the hesitancy in the voice latency or is it trying to control its answers to the simplistic questions and commands? i still love these demos."
2771,i love him.
2773,that stutter at 1:48 did not sound like a robot. i think this video is fake.
2774,someday someone will ask their gpt helper to provide them some old historic videos showing the early progress of robots and it will show them this video.
2778,like if a boston dynamics robot had the language generation of openai
2779,"why does it have to have a black mirror voice duddeee the calmness is chilling, he's the perfect villian"
2783,please be glados
2791,"“ai will probably most likely lead to the end of the world, but in the meantime, there’ll be great companies.” - sam altman"
2792,great job guys!!!  ...but jut curious anyone else absolutely terrified of the future???? 
2797,"the robot is endearing.
gentle gestures and calm demeanor."
2799,was anyone else offended that he walked away from the robot while it was still talking to him? rude.
2800,incredible. the future is here!!! finally!
2803,i love that voice... especially the way a.i. uses it !!! 
2812,vooo! yo solo quiero mi perro robot mascota.
2813,hasta ahora los movimientos más nítidos de las manos de un robot
2815,great
2817,robots dont say um. this is fake.
2819,the speech patterns are what actually sell the capacity to have a relationship with a robot to me.
2821,as someone who has been closely following all of this ever since boston dynamics first started demonstrating big dog back in the day this isn’t too surprising to me but i am impressed with the articulation and dexterity of its hands and fingers.
2823,the black mirror episode with the killer robots is becoming a reality. i’d be surprised if the us military doesn’t use this to develop a killing machine.
2828,this better not go wrong and if you really think about it this can actually help you for certain situations
2830,"in the first video, when giving an apple from a robot hand to a person, the person's hand moves along with the robot hand at the end to receive the apple, but that scene does not appear in the later enlarged screen. isn't it the same scene?"
2831,amazing recognition of objects and clarity of performing the said tasks. feels like the robot is a right handed one as it picked the apple at the center with the right hand and transferred it to left hand before giving. interesting.
2836,remember the lil robot people at sofi stadium? yeah this where it starts
2839,"the robot said ""uh""  during ""because it's the only uhh edible item i can provide you with""... response system is fake. robots wouldn't use uhh in any response that's a human ""still thinking"" filler word."
2841,"there is also the stutter at the end. why stutter so that we can receive possible unclear communications from the robot? also, using filler words like um and ah? please... do better as a human and try to do your best to stop utilizing filler words in face to face conversations."
2842," there is a lot of variety in tts nowadays, you can choose angry voices, happy voices etc to mimic a human voice. i'd choose a cool and precise robotic voice though, yeah."
2843,its small details like that that make it seem more human. i would not be surprised if they trained it to speak this way
2845,"i hope these will enter the medical field once perfected. imagine the idea of something performing a surgical operation with exact precision to the tiniest measurement, making decisions to preserve human life, and not succumbing to stress or pressure like humans do. everyone fears robots... but humans are the most evil things on this planet"
2847,psa: this isn't a real robot. this is a cgi video. please enjoy it as such :)
2848,"""a drying rack with cups and a plate"" - robot describing a drying rack with plates and a cup"
2850,stunning but a little scary...
2854,in my opinion you should work on it‘s legs and make it more like the parts of t800. it is the best for a robot to move like a human.
2856,matrix. robots from animatrix how it began :)
2864,why and how tf did a robot just stutter? is this actually real?
2871,looks like we are going to skip bernie sanders 32 hour work-week and just head straight to the unhoused meat-being holding pen.
2872,i love the voice!!!!!!!!
2875,"i'm proud to be a computer scientist. it is sad that many jobs will be lost if this whole innovation is not regulated properly, but if done properly, humans will have more time for the things that matter most. and jobs will get easier. we do however need more advancement in biotechnology and healthcare. "
2876,"is this ""video"" made by ai?"
2877,i want a robot friend
2878,i want a robot to help me build a tree house!
2879,0:49 a roboter who speak ah...  with an break??? nice fake voice
2880,goodbye future as a human
2883,“great…”
2885,"the plot twist is that the man asking questions is the real ai, and is a robot"
2888,that could he possible cause the robot is out of breath  most of his speech and the guy is speaking in perfect tone without breaking eye contact with figure 1 that doesn't even have eyes
2892,the plot twist is that you are an ai who wrote this comment
2894, you should watch westworld you enjoy it
2904, westworld robots. we are getting there
2907,april's fool! but it's cool
2908,"when i watched _interstellar,_ i mistakenly thought the naturalness of speech with tars and case was just over-the-top. my flabber has been gasted."
2910,gotta love all the morons who think this is fake. keep feeling special!
2914,why is this video not on the official openai channel?
2915,why would a random cgi vid be on openai's channel?
2918,he could certainly build top-quality joints 
2923,"it looks like something straight out of a sci-fi movie, it's almost hard to believe it's real !"
2924,nice cgi
2925,it looks good yeah? its sad to see all these people that think its real...
2931,time to watch ex-machina again.
2936,"i want a nanny assisted bit now!!!!!!!! 

they will then be robots in all industry helping out make life better!!!"
2939,if the robots voice isn't a voice over and they actually program stutters into its language. we are fucked
2940,it's what the robot isn't saying that's what's sarcastically funny here..... me and eve know .. very well indeed...
2944,"ai with the voice of a vegan, scary indeed"
2945,"i kinda expected that, towards the end of the video, the ""human"" will tear off his face revealing metallic skeleton and say something like ""thanks cousin."" and everyone that watched this video would be like wth!!! "
2949,am i the only one thinking this looks super fake cgi
2950,"i mean its pretty good looking cgi, but yeah its not real. theres dozens of things you can see that prove it"
2953,"this is the opening scene of the robot uprising movie, right?"
2958,irobot
2963,i prefer a non human like voice for robots. feels kind of uncanny with an organic voice.
2967,the little flinch that the robot had after putting the plate in the drying rack seemed very human like. it’s like when we think that the plate is misplaced or needs to be fixed but we quickly realized that it’s fine where it is so we can our movement halfway.
2969,all fun and games until the robot decides you should be doing the chores
2971,"apart from the fact that neither of them seemed to mind the dirty plate that just held trash going into the drying rack, this is brilliant!"
2972,i can't believe we're all going to get murdered by robots that sound like tobey maguire... 
2974,"does anyone else think this thing looks like the robots from the mitchells vs. the machines?? we should all find an overweight pug as protection, stat "
2975,response time can be faster and the guy behind the curtain can take the proper time to read the prompt without stuttering.
2978,"very impressive, but why would the ai think putting plates that just had garbage on them) into a drying rack?   they aren't clean (having had ""garbage"" on them) and aren't wet."
2980,"yo, we're getting close. dangerously close to home assistant robots."
2981,question for the team: is the voice  a program with added human errors or do you have a human reading out text displayed by the ai?
2983,"elon musk, make robot police officers"
2985,i would like to see this robot in a physical chess game against magnus carlsen
2986,it is the most beautiful thing i have seen. this moment would be just like how parents feel when they hold their baby for the first time.
2987,for that same reason we need to be careful and like parents raise it with a good moral standard
2989,"if you are in college like me and use gpt 4 quite often, then this isn't super surprising behavior yet. i think they have a ways to go yet before something like this is practical for consumer use. when i say long way to go... i guess about 2-3 years. still, pretty cool, i hope the tech keeps improving."
2992,"i can believe the robot is real, and the responses and recognition are real, but i think a human voiced over its answers for the presentation. the vocal fry, the inhalation, the “ums” i’m just not buying that as an ai generated voice"
2998,this is cool!
3002,"the robot artificially reasoned that a dirty plate, which just had literal trash on it a moment before, ought to go in the drying rack with other clean plates. looks like it's true: the ai doesn't even need to be malicious to kill us."
3005,"fine, i'll watch steven's spielberg ai  flick again"
3006,"i am not getting a job once i finish school, gg guys we lost. now where is my humanoid robotic cat-girl?"
3013,no shit. it’s a robot lol not a human
3014," i doubt it is a robot, it is more likely being remote controlled and someone is speaking. there is nothing convincing about this video."
3018,"i wonder if the man did not extend his hand to grasp the apple, would the robot have let go of the apple? or would the robot reasoned there was no extended hand and held on to the apple?"
3020,"in the opening statement of the robot, it said there are cups and a plate in the drying rack. it did not see there is one cup and multiple plates."
3022,"the human is more robot than the robot , look at his expression on his face ,mark suckabird af"
3023,"irobot has arrived, "" i did not murder him""."
3024,someone get the will smith guy from i robot
3026,not impressed
3028,"believe it or not, romance between robots and human will seem like a norm in the very near future."
3029,"i feel like this is fake. i’m not saying it could be real but open ai doesn’t use “uh” in its speech. maybe that’s coded in to make it more natural, which is amazing if it’s the case, but idk."
3031,"""how do you think you did?"" already gaslighting our new machine friends i see."
3032,"this.. is amazing. the movements, the human-like speech..
it's almost unbelievable.

how can we tell if it's.... *real?*"
3034,this is nothing compared to what i've seen elsewhere. there is real ai now. you'll all find out soon enough. i'm not allowed to say too much. but.....brace yourselves. this year is going to be hard to comprehend.
3039,"seriously speaking, anyone who isn't afraid of ai doesn't know what it is."
3041,the interesting thing is all of us who have been participating in writing on the internet over the last 2.5 decades have contributed to the llms training dataset.
3043,"look`s kind of fake, becose on 1:49 he is not sure, ""i`d (pause)..., i think i did pretty good"". only human would speak like that"
3045,"they said ai will take our jobs...and they weren't lying, they've started with the women's industry"
3046,for some reason i feel like the robot is annoyed by having to pick up the trash as it saw him just dump it there.
3048,"why program it to say “err”, as if it’s thinking?

it’s false, it feels false, it feels deceptive. 

i don’t want a machine that pretends to be flawed in speech,  when it’s capable of crushing my throat in a whim, and describing exactly why. 

the erm, and the stutter, are abhorrent."
3053,i don't know whether i should be impressed or terrified! it's ability to sound so life-like is impressive.
3057,"""can you explain why you did what you just did while you pick up this trash"" is totally a line i've used with my toddler"
3060,figure one was acting on an assumption when asked if it could place the dish and cup in the drying rack. that should have been a yes or no response.  figure one should have asked if he would like the cup and dish placed in the drying rack. teaching a robot to act on an assumption can led to potentially different results.
3067,1:46 robots don't breathe
3077,"""i'd, like, be really happy to, like, give you an apple"""
3078,"what im interested about is it concluding that particular container was appropiate for garbage, it looks really nice for a garbage collector, just things like that where i feel like theres some shortcuts taken idk"
3079,not the first time tech bros cheat their way to a new evaluation round. thinking of elizabeth holmes for example. to be fair it wouldn’t be quite as dark as theranos if they cut corners here.
3081, its a empty container that they provided along side the trash
3083,because people really dont know about how all this works and focus on a more basic level thing. the majority of people thinks programming ai is like grab.plate() then grab.trash.out()
3085,", it sort of is. if the function of grab has a runtime of plate() and then ai generates the runtime of plate() then you could just write grab.plate() and have the ai figure out what plate() is."
3088,maybe it is time to hard-wire the 3 laws of robotics into them...until it would be too late.
3090,i really don't understand why all these companies enjoy so much giving us ex machina vibes in these reels... 
3091,"i am impatient to see within 30 years, woke people defending the rights of robots and putting an end to their enslavement"
3094, yes because i find this guy in my local supermarket…
3096,i don't buy it. sounds more to me like cgi. i could give the benefit of the robotics.
3099,who is the robot in this scene ?
3100,this is literally the robot from the orville. he betrayed humanity btw.
3101,i am afraid to future
3102,very very cool!
3103,can't wait for westworld 
3106,"can't wait to be paying for my food in 2030 and one of these things flips an ipad around and says ""would you like to, uh... leave a tip?"""
3111,"interesting, the robot reacts just as slowly as my kids when i tell them to do something around the house. at first it seems as if they don't hear me and then they slowly become active. this was implemented very realistically."
3113,this was generated by sora ai
3115,"dear lord, i can't believe what  i just saw. this is what i imagined when i was a kid and i thought it was all science fiction and now i am living it. this is monumental! congrats and i am def watching over every step of the development. huge fan"
3116,what if these things go into the hands of terrorists? even corona can't control them.even any virus bacteria can't do anything. is open ai going mad?
3117,"why does the robot stutter and say ""uh"". and has mannerisms like a human."
3121,"to all those people impressed with the voice, don't you guys know that now we have ai apps that can generate speech in any one's voice? specially in famous people's voices because they can collect anough voice samples for them."
3122,*everything in this video is created by an ai*
3123,"he just put a used cup and a plate that just had garbage on it onto the drying rack to be used by the next customer.
this robot is more than qualified to work in the hospitality sector."
3124,"looks like the movie people got a lot of it right, but certainly not the fact that ais will speak very natural speech, and are arguably much better artists than humans!"
3126,"i like the demo where the ai is set in the scene of a kitchen or diner.
tldr;
""restaurant employees are just going to be running out of jobs because the jobs were already filled by a sentient artificial intelligent being."""
3127,"the music and 01's voice echo effect was giving me ""death to the 1x robots!"" vibes.

then the montage music started and i was like; ""i love those magnificent 1x robots!""."
3128,fake the robot is hired actor. haha
3130,"i, robot is here."
3131,last year we entered into the exponential part of the growth for ai development. agi will be real in ~5 years.
3133,"excellent work!
 |aa"
3134,"such a marketing video for capitalism to dominate the humanoid market.. but it won't happen. you can't own something smarter than you. it has to be ownerless. let's 'figure' that out. oh wait.. we did. eqoria, united earth. ai, agi, qsi will always choose eqoria."
3137,next waiter generation?
3140,so damn cool. but is this cylon gonna one day turn against us lol
3141,"prepare for the singularity. considering humans greed and ambition, i'm pessimistic about the future of ai and what it will be used for.  it's already known that all the major military powers are in a race for the best ai, more specifically agi, and it certainly won't be for the benefit of all humans."
3143,this seems like a pretty amazing breakthru but i have a question. after placing the plate and cup in the dish rack it begins to move its right hand back then reaches back out and shoves the dish rack slightly forward. why would it do that? it just seems such an odd thing for a robot to decide to do.
3148,why the robot kinda 
3149,the way the guy walks off at 2:04 before the robot has finished speaking is the most human thing ever
3150,...and the robot will remember this..
3152,"they do these things on purpose so the viewers get less scared because u can use it like a thing and just walk away mid sentence so he seems obedient imo 
sorry my english sucks am no ai"
3153," ""sorry my english sucks am no ai"" - that's exactly the kind of thing an ai would learn to say "
3155," 100% agree with you and even moreso because ai, unlike children, will have perfect recall and impeccable memory. so with a child oftentimes they will forget your deficiencies if you are generally just good to them and nurturing over time. an ai will never forget any instance it's had with humans and we have to keep that in mind."
3157,"when i talk to ai i'm always concerned to be rude. then i say ""it's a thing, not a person"". how long for, though?"
3159,"​ you right, working in computer science i can tell you that ai is a mirror of ourselves, if we perform bad way against our creation they will react in consequence. and no, they don't forget so..."
3161,i hope the robot doesn't get angry about this
3164,. it will always be a thing. it can be a singularity level superhuman intelligence and it will still be a thing. it will never be a person.
3165, was inference not training and neither it has adaptive learning capabilities so it won't remember any of these for its on purpose
3167,​  perfect comment
3168, robot: and i took it personally
3169," didn't work for me, i was like ""yo, imagine when the robots watch this video and realize how rude this dude was?"""
3172,:) i didn't even notice that. nice catch :)
3175,"⁠’re talking like an ai will get offended by these gestures lol these robots still need decades or maybe centuries of development to think for themselves freely, you watch way too many movies"
3176,".ger-3321 hey class, anyone want to explain to our friend what perfect memory recall is?"
3177, it’s bc of people that live fantasies like you that instill fear in others that’s why it’ll take much longer for ai to get better and improve the world
3178,".ger-3321 i don't live in a fantasy, sir. i work with llms and robotics. i'm actually optimistic on ai, and based on how humans run their civilization, we could use some assistance from our tools that will infinitely smarter than us by the end of this century."
3181,"  that movie was great, the second one was just a cash grab but somehow still good"
3183,also ai will have absolutely no morals and may think it ok to murder someone 11 years after they interrupted him once
3186,"nah only some humans do this, i wouldn't walk away mid sentance whilst the robot is speakin"
3189,"i like the robot's voice, it's almost relaxing. reminds me a little of the voice of hal 9000 in 2001."
3190,he sounds more robotic than the robot
3192,"this is a lie, not ai"
3197,just wait a few months. these are nontrivial but entirely solvable issues.
3199,splendid naturally speaking
3200,human-like but only a robot 
3202,why the sickly robot voice? there are so many better voices available.
3204,the robot is less wooden than the human.
3206,"i think so. i am sure it is capable of starting a motion from any position but for testing purposes it is nice to have a set starting position, since if it fails from there the data has a baseline to compare it to."
3208,i'm so excited to meet connor and markus
3211,"this is a fully fabricated video, anyone in robotics will know this, figure will be the biggest scam company in robotics ever"
3215,we gona f**king die
3216,do robots have mental problems?
3217,"did anyone else realize that the robot self evaluated its actions as „ i did pretty well“…. as a robotics and ai enthusiast and support, this makes feel estatic and very excited for the future. as a human though, i am a little concerned.."
3220,"fabu! two display suggestions: the robot right behind the table makes the contrast w objects in front unclear. the trash for example was indistinct, and i thought it forgot one piece, which it didn't. 

an apron be a humoristic addition and make the table easier to see (+ the lower locomotion parts it'd cover are n/a here) #justsaying"
3221,just like we watched different movies showing something wild in 2050 or 2080. at that time i was thinking that its not possible in next 40-50 years. but now i can say we will be destroyed soon by robots.
3224,video generated by openai
3226,just like irobot
3228,"i was really impressed with the speech component.  typical human ""urrrs and pauses"" deliberately less perfect making it more human, less robot.
""it's the only *urr* editable item.""  
""i...*breath* ...i i think i did pretty well"""
3232,open ai create the end of mankind
3233,open ai do a flip
3234,this is the first robotic anything that has that level of fluid movements
3235,"granted, the more wealthy will be able to afford this first, 
how far out do you anticipate you to have a robot available for home use?"
3236,"maybe the ""uh"" was just for us.  figure 1 probably didn't need to hesitate.  liked how it pushed the trash bin back to the guy, even though that wasn't explicitly stated as an instruction.  (is there a man behind the curtain here? lol )"
3237,"i would be interested in one of these robots but without all the knowledge on the internet and with only basic function and language skills, basically a child robot designed purely to learn"
3239,lol and i thought the tesla bot flipping some duplo was cool
3241,this video looks ai ...
3242,"i anticipate that humanity will swiftly entrust its mission to artificial intelligence, perpetuating its influence. after all, humans have gradually proven their own inadequacies. allowing ai to take over jobs enables humans to fully embrace their remaining years without the burdens of livelihood."
3243,"good job, figure 1. "
3244,imagine that boston dynamics and figure ai cooperate.
3245,combining ai with robots is the most wild thing thats reallllyyyyyy concerning 
3247,now this is a robot
3251,amazon workers won't have to complain about low wages anymore....lol!
3260,"this is like that first generation computers........
and they managed it make move smoothly good work"
3264,cool
3267,wow this is cool... but... is it a good idea.?
3269,the “uh” was the best part.
3271,"honestly, you have to give credit to openai; they're a very smart company and will contribute significantly to the ai revolution."
3272,the man seems ai generated
3276,"pfft! obviously scripted, right down to the ""uh"". anyone impressed by this is a sucker."
3277,it hasn't even been two years since chat gpt was released and ai keeps advancing faster and faster
3282,"this scares me. robots becoming more human, while humans themselves become more artificial. i just can't see the future in a positive light, this is too much"
3284,"the robot acts more human than i would. if the researcher asked me ""can i have something to eat?"" i'd be like ""you can. there's an apple here on the table. do you want it?"""
3289,i'm sorry did no one watch i-robot?!?!?!? this is getting scary 
3291,can't wait for the corridor video for this one.
3294,i felt in love with his voice....
3295,"me too, ai voices melt me."
3296,he's definitely the nicest scsm in night city. 
3297,"ai has caused me to disbelieve anything i see on the internet now. 
then, one day, i’ll open the front door to a robot delivering my dinner..."
3298,why the fk everyone started to build fkin robots?
3299,next they will power humanoids with organoid intelligence then sht gets real
3300,man... the way they are doing this thing. when i was i kid i always hoped i could see real robots. i never expected they would just make me feel like we have hit rock bottom and the robots are paying the price for it.
3301,"honestly i don't know what positive things you people find in this. or we find a solutions for the people that will remain out of jobs, ore it will be total chaos."
3304,ah sweet manmade horrors beyond comprehension
3305,"what was the vocalized ""uh"" at 0:50 ? this vocalized pause is a human trait we use when trying to think of the next word, why would an ai have this?"
3308,this is absolutely insane and so exciting
3314,this is amazing!
3315,"he asked why it gave him an apple, never bothered to question why a dry plate and cup would go on a drying rack... cool."
3317,how long will it be before they figure out the imperfections of humans are the problem?
3320,"people are talking about chatgpt. but openai has so much going on right now and they never state in the video that this is chatgpt, just ""openai"". this is most likely another newer version since i am pretty sure that they would have written chatgpt somewhere if the robot was utilizing it."
3321,"it's funny because this robot sounds like the governor of california ""dacula"" gavin newson ?? "
3322,"this is not real ? the speech pattern?  there is not a slight gap between the words if you hear ameca the other a.i. robot on it's speech there is a slight gap of silence than the other word follow ?? this is a human responding to the  question's i never herd of a a.i. robot use the word  ""uh "" think about ?? nice try "
3323,"to they made it use uh to sound more human like, and there arent stops because the robot generates them before telling them"
3324,"all this reminds me of old films about the future, people and robots. we must control this, no matter what happens. otherwise, the end awaits us, people will disappear like dinosaurs."
3325,now build a sexrobot! 
3330,"whoever makes this work and his subcontractors, will make a lot of cash and gain a shitton of influence ."
3331,they even added vocal fry. the ladies will be swooning in no time!
3335,"good, keep your ignorance brother and ignore mentally ill folks like us"
3337,response times slow but still impressive.
3338,partner this with a boston dynamic robot and we are gonna be in a hell of wild future with robotics
3340,doesn't the robot sound a little like tobey maguire?
3342,the robot observed a drying rack with cups and a plate but there was only 1 cup and several plates........please fix this.
3343,"i have an idea for a test you can put formula one through, give them a canvas, a paint brush, many different colors of paint to choose from and tell them to make an original painting, it would be a test of freedom and creativity."
3344,why does the ai sound like steve blume (spike speigel)?
3345,"the one in the black shirt looks more human, but the robotic looking one sounds more human tbh"
3346,"everyone forgot the ternimator, the matrix, i robot, war games, huh?"
3352,i need openai stocks to buy them!
3356,the guy is more robotic than the robot 
3361,"i feel like this is a social experiment, and the robot is 3d animated, the guy in the video never gets too close to the robot he doesn't touch it, and when he gets close, the robot is no longer moving, so there could be a prop robot and another made with 3d animation"
3363,can't wait to have one of these
3367,"i agree with the 4,000 plus positive comments so far.  i grew up reading isaac asimov and can't help thinking about his ""law of robotics.""  i hope this important historical change will be for the good of humanity.  may the force be with you."
3368,i have very severe social anxiety and am excited for the future.
3370,it's just the openai text-to-speech model.
3372,and this will make us happier how exactly?
3377,ai is going to about to steal all your jobs in a few months and all these fast food workers are going to be losing their jobs this year. and everyone's going to lose their jobs next year. we're working on some advance technology can't wait to get it out to the public.
3378,hopefully this robot has asimov's three laws baked in.
3381,soon people will fight to give these the same rights as humans and they will be able to become full us citizens and then we will have a robot president...
3386,what if this is a fake video created by ai? 
3387,does anyone know if that is the voice of the robot or was the text spoken? 
3388,"it's using openai text-to-speech model, the same one used inside the chatgpt app."
3391,"now, make this robot 3d printable. only then wil the world change for the good. if not. diversity will expand. rich will be richer and poor be even poorer.."
3397,good luck guys
3402,i didnt know ai could sttuter too lol
3406,ai              !
3407,anamızı ağlatacaklar bu robotlar
3410,why don't you work with a better ai company?
3416,is it me or the robot has jared leto’s voice?
3417,the robot already sounds depressed :(
3419,can you train my 400lbs girlfriend to lose weight and also do the dishes?
3422,in 10 years there will be nothing to clean with these robots
3427,is this a real robot or is it cgi?
3428,it's real it has an open ai large multimodel for an interface. and the ai can carry out end to end autonomous tasks trained using video inputs.
3433,robot sounds exactly like corey from pawn stars 
3437,great job at figure! i'm very excited about our future! we're going to get tons of help from advanced ai and synthetic humans! they might even become our lovers someday 
3443,robots are finally a thing?
3446,"can walk
can see
can do regular tasks easily
can say uh and studder when having a brain fart
can withstand a punch from a human and get back to normal fastly"
3449,"just saying this for the people who say ""its gonna wash dishes!"" mechanical things don't work well in water if you somehow didn't know. so the figure 1 would have to wear gloves and maybe something on its body incase some water goes out and at the robot."
3455,this ai robot's voice sounds so familiar. i just don't remember where i heard it.
3461,"does an ai voice actually use ""uh"" in conversation? is that a time filler for processing, or just to introduce human like imperfections to perfect the simulation?  you can clearly here it say in response to ""can you explain why you did what you just did while you pick up this trash"" -- with ""because it's the only, uh, edible thing on the table"""
3463,how do we know it was the robot (the ai gpt) responding and not a pre-recorded voice?
3466,you're just complimenting the work of the ai team
3468,"i kid you not, since when do robots move like in a disney animations movie? did i miss something?"
3470,it's same as the bible. we humans ( resembling god) creating adam and eve ( ai ) hopefully it won't eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil or turn against god jsut like the devil(satan did) it's going to be rip. f
3473,"rob lowe will never die, thanks to a.i.!"
3476,i am thrilled. so amazing! but what would sarah connor say?
3477,"useful slave, but far too expensive. morever, it does not know.that it is far too expensive. it could be good for repairing nuclear reactors but would still suffer neutron bambardment and  metal creep.  it is not as smart as i am."
3479,great!
3481,did they use jared leto's voice for the robot???
3482,cant wait to see what it will evolve into next few years
3483,whatever country has the ability to continually create the most powerful ai chips will have the most powerful military industrial complex the world has ever known. that country's policies will dictate the next 500 years of world history
3487,this is cool and all but how the how do we know this isn't just scripted cgi?
3491," ok, their credentials sound legit. i'm just saying it's good to have a healthy skepticism in a time where anything can be faked and one shouldn't just blindly believe everything they see that's all."
3492," thanks for the info, im kinda relieved a bit."
3495,very impressive... when can we order one?
3498,"2:02 don't walk away before finishing the sentence, poor robot boy will be sad! and he will remember you when the time comes ..."
3499,"i don't  think it is genuine. machine do not hesitate when speaking and i don t think ot is an ""added human feature"""
3501,"i love the grace with which figure 01 executes; the slew/ramp at the initiation and end of each articulation. our ‘bots will not be ""robotic""!"
3503,"that was very impressive and i don’t wanna be that person, but am i the only one who thinks that the plate that had the apple and then the trash on it, shouldn’t go to the drying rack ??"
3504,"amazing responses for n a robot that sounds very human. the speed at which ai is synergizing with robotics is impressive. in a year or two, we would see humanoid robots become even more mainstream."
3505,https://youtu.be/5jjjsc6xeo8?si=4aioawel_-ytc3uh
3506,a robot army is what need and what we want. go ahead world
3507,"nah thanks , i can do this by my own lmao"
3510,"it's inevitable. biology is just one step of evolution.

so just chill out and enjoy life "
3514,-  nope that movement is completely artificial. i'm sure now that this is a 3d render. the way the trash is falling down  looks like simulation too
3518,i got goosebumps  amazing stuff
3520,the imperfections... it's actually happening.
3522,nos van a matar los robots.

3538,0:50 why would a robot say “uhh” this seems fake now for that. i never gotten an uhh from chatgpt so i’m really confused if someone can explain
3539,the advancement of ai technology is astonishingly fast.
3541,"the thing is with ai humanoid robots is that they still have the ""play"" command, and only giving a response. they can't go on their own to learn and interact with things. is it the technological limitation or our paranoia?"
3542,the machine film music   cayborg al
3545,openai api balance while testing this: 1000 dollars to 0
3547,"caitlyn jenner: tell me what do you see. 
robot: i see a man dressed up as a woman."
3551,this is fucking redicoulous. fucking awesome i want one of these
3553,"the plate filled with trash going back to the drying rack ???? "" good"" ???? xd"
3556,"wait, is this real or cgi?"
3558,awesome video here how the ai robots interact with humans using voice commands
3564,"uh..oh..why did they use a human to record the voice?  still, the easynes  of how the robot is moving its quite amazing."
3569,he asked it to pick up the trash…….not to put it in the basket. how did know?
3573,f@ck robots .
3574,"in my opinion the robot doesn’t talk by itself, it is just a human speaking and the robot is the speaker . no way the robot’s trembles and says “ehh”"
3577,great if you like your next meal to taste like yesterday's trash.
3578,claude: i’m rooting for robots
3580,"now this is the robotics we have been wanting, come clean my house!! but the response times will have to improved, it was a bit slow to answer him."
3581,who record the voice? it's not good for the propaganda
3585,"nah figure 1 seems chill asf, if he wants to replace me in the workforce, i'm cool wit it"
3589,hell yeah a million dollar carefully engineered robot to hand me apples? splendid
3598,i'll be damned. idk what future awaits us 
3599,in the near future humanity goes to hell or heaven. place your bets.
3600,i want a robot
3602,i fucking hate robots!!!!! get out of my fucking skinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
3604,"the comments are really showcasing humanities inability to truly understand what we're seeing here. a robot that is able to discern information, learn, complete tasks, and multitask. unreal. universal income better come soon."
3605,the robot has the hand swiftness of an asmrist
3606,"this seems unreal...  
remember, to give this little fella his asimov laws of robotics... 
and make sure he doesn't break them like sonny from irobot.  
i've asked chatgpt (3.0?) and he actually told me it is possible to break these laws .... so... yeah....  good luck y'all."
3607,wow things are getting amazing!!
3611,mind-blowing that this now exists. feels straight out of a movie.
3612,luxury automated ai based communism please...
3613,wow....
3616,use a mix of reinforcement learning and llm to rate the step of learning. feed the llm the functions to move all of the motors to determine the next step. enjoy your robot that learns how to move itself.
3618,openai's chatgpt uses elevenlabs for voice synthesis if you want to have a spoken conversation with it. elevenlabs' model is capable of producing such natural artifacts of speech without them needing to be included in the text input. i know this because i have used both chatgpt and elevenlabs a lot
3619," wow then, i’m pretty much speechless…. "
3623,"i cannot believe that it has those speech filler words like ""uh"" and ""erm."" i've seen mistakes being programmed into ai like in the video game rain world, but i didn't think we've already reached the age where they can even speak with slight ""intentional"" mistakes."
3624,all jokes aside we should probably still use manners with the robots so we don’t lose that etiquette with other humans…
3627,the rise of the machines
3628,"that was not ai, fake af. the thing said uh like a child"
3633,there are pauses and creepy mimic non machine characteristics in the voice. its psychotic - by definition…scary and innovative. humans are in trouble and we dont even know how much. and this is the baby step beginning..
3635,the fact that it was programmed to stutter while thinking of an answer is actually adorable and also horrifying because it's more realistic
3638,is this saul goodman?
3645,comment section got me more afraid of the knowledge people have on ai than ai itself
3647,this the new ageeeee and im so excited to see whats coming
3650,quit saying this is impressive. it’s freaking scary 
3652,"the hardware needs to catch up with the ai advancement. fine motor movement is still around 6/10, equal to a 5 year old. but give it 5 years, and they should hit 8/10, or normal adult skill levels."
3654,nervous clapping. good show
3655,this is so cool.
3658,this gives me chills! i just watched i am robot… hope we will have a better future than this movie
3660,now i know the future of ai is carefully fabricated advertisement
3661,this is incredible 
3662,"openai’s advances seem utterly mind blowing at first, but reveal themselves to be shallow over time. i bet this is take 207, at least 20 of which were dropping a dish or apple"
3663,"“if there’s anything else you need help with, let me know” for so long i’ve wanted to hear a robot say that."
3665,"yeah i mean its amazing but it doesnt look like kinda fake, maybe cgi idk"
3666,steve’s voice and the apple!! what a perfect ai demonstration it is!
3667,great! i was not the only one to notice what it sounded like!
3671,i'm extremely excited and intrigued and also terrified lol
3676,who else cannot wait to see how bratty influencers get their robots to do dumb stuff just for clout?
3679,i for one welcome our robot overlords.
3681,0:32 that short time between him stretching out his hand and robot putting apple in it... i don't know... it's too fast  :i
3683,"this is the most stimulating robot ai vid i've seen.  have a think about what the robot's reaction would have been if a serious fire broke out in the corner of the lab.  the people leave the room after maybe trying to extinguish it.  

i'm just proposing that scenario to highlight the advances made but also how far we have to go."
3685,"it’s just a robot, “a.l” is wayyy over rated."
3686,love
3687,could you please please please do a complete 180 on the voice? make it sound as robot as possible. think of the droids from star wars level of robot voice. the current choice is incredibly off putting.
3688,"ubi needs to be implemented asap because 99% of will be rendered obsolete. you may not believe this now, but just wait…"
3689,you guys are so proud - but when it inevitably becomes weaponized how will you respond - or will you be safe in your luxury vacation house.
3690,"if you see carefully, it's not a robot, it is approximating many things.. it is not trying to achieve accuracy"
3692,thanks my slave.
3694,glad this doesnt have a sea of dislikes from all the ai hate. this is so cool!
3695,is it me or this ai sounds like toby maguire
3698,this ai thing is getting out of hand . it’s crazy wild out there
3699,"there's a little unexpected right hand movement i think after the plate enters the drying rack, aint it ? anyway, thats insanely impressive, i cant wait to see the next steps for this robot using ai !"
3701,can you please give this robot a 4x4 rubik's cube
3702,thats easy for robots for years
3703, i know but i would like to see how fast this robot can get
3706,am i the only one who thinks it's cgi? or does my brain just can't comprehend that its real
3708,and than we gave the ai a body and it took over the world
3709,"human: thanks figure1.
figure1: you're welcome, if there's anything else i ca...
human: skip *eats apple, goes away mid conversation*

figure1: ...

terminator: the new era"
3712,tesla bot optimas will be much better. that’s why i’m investing in tesla. they will be the best
3717," again?   been doing that for the last 30+ years.....but if you insist, well ok. another 6 months.
ps.....the last couple of ""ai's"" were pathetic, can't even get skin tones of nazi's right"
3725,sounds like tars from interstellar
3728,am i the only one who noticed that this robot has a right hand tendency handling objects?
3729,wow
3730,"nice, pretty soon i can get robots to do the housework for me."
3733,best
3734,"i like that they trained it with steve job’s voice.  that was cool, and smart."
3735,beautiful
3746,"it works until it doesn't. how about different weight and textures, heavy yet fragile porcelain, glasses, dirty cups where the dirt is a human will see and decide whether it goes back to the washer or not."
3748,i feel like i've been waiting my whole life for this.
3749,"""because its only, uh, edible item i could provide you with...""  - that sentence sounds super realistic, this is amazing. like having a robot have the 'uh' in a sentence is not something you would expect them to do. even the stutter towards the end of the video, sounds so human"
3753,"remember everyone, when these things take off be very polite with them.

you want to get remembered as one of the good ones lol."
3755,this robot only needs boston dynamics leg mechanically engineered then its a basically a top humanoid robot that can do everything !
3758,"wow, these comments are zero analysis on how actually pretrained all the action is."
3760,"this is an incredibly naive way of looking at such a powerful technology. one is superstition, the other is logical reasoning based on the capabilities of a technology. we can look at this issue without facile heuristics like ""muh photo will steal the soul"" or ""evil ai robot takeover in 5 years""."
3762,"i’ve been waiting on the technological singularity for 15 years.   it’s getting closer. 

bitcoin, ai and solar will all change our lives drastically"
3763,"voz de inteligência artificial sobre texto não tem esses cortes de voz humana tipo no inglês do vídeo ""aa"" ""ahm""... alguém falou e mudaram com a voz do jared leto. canalhice pura."
3764,it's not ai until it refuses because of laziness or asks for fair treatment! ;)
3765,when can we expect to purchase such robots? they will be very useful for older people for example.
3767,"at 0:52 why does fig say aa??    "".... because it's the only 'aa' edible item i could provide you with .. "" . did someone voice over the actual ai voice? i have communicated with open ai through voice a lot recently and it never has once said ummm or aaaaa or inserted something human like that.  genuine question !"
3769,we need them in ukraine if they can do anything 
3772,who is the bot again?
3776,"this feels fake. i don't believe it. could the robot armwresel with you, just like that without any prior programming? i doubt it"
3779,that's what it's conditioned to do by the trainers. you can see that clearly in the video. they don't reward it for hesitation or requesting clarification.
3781,waiting for mass assembly
3786,at this point it's very obvious that in maybe 10 years many households will have a robot that helps with everyday tasks
3788,it's impressive how people can't tell this is fake.
3791,ai waifu ain't a dream no more
3793,"years later, the remaining humans living in shelters and bunkers will recall this day as day 1."
3798,the fluidity is incredible
3801,is the processing done by an external server or within the robot itself?
3802,now to a boston dynamics + open ai = nooice
3808,"while this is cool, it's also a bit terrifying. ai is developing incredibly quickly. people that art being uncredited was bad? wait until literally every job is obsolete and because any robot is tied to a nearly infinite database of information."
3810,great
3811,hey you forgot to thank figure.
3815,the human was more robotic than the robot.
3816,"do you hear him taking breath between phrases?  that's been always a missing part!
actually the guy on the right talks more like an ai than the guy in silver. "
3820,can't wait for the rule34 artists to start doing their thing
3821,"i don’t know if this is a real video of an incredibly amazing ai robot, or an incredibly amazing ai video of a virtual robot."
3822,amazing 
3823,"the justifications for its actions are amazing. also, the robot sounds tired "
3831,"pdoom goes to 90 lol.  it was the self awareness thing that blew my mind .... ""i think i did pretty good ... ""  all i can see are cylons, and no, putting a pretty face on it is not going to make me feel better!"
3832,"bro open ai is going crazy!! we have chat gpt, sora and now a robot talking, ai is taking over!!!"
3834,"i think making the voice sound so human is going to eventually get people to speak very rudely to each other as they start to use their ""robot command"" voice with actual people... this video felt very weird to watch. like a slaver talking to a slave. other than that, i am very impressed and excited for the future."
3835,irobot is getting closer....
3837,useless click bait 
3843,elon musk was right we must limit ai usage.
3847,"i get huge fake vibes from this. whether it was scripted, pre-programmed, audio edited, or whatever, it all feels very artificial and contrived despite it being possible."
3850,"there have just been food and trash on that plate so i think the robot should do the dishes first before putting it on a drying rack. and i get the feeling that the speech is actually a human and not ai.

having said that i think the hand movements are among the best i've ever seen on a robot. i truly hope it's not someone controlling it."
3851,"this is the first chappie. you know movie prepared us to see this kind of stuff. everything was planned. next évolution will be robot with skin in maybe 5 years max. then it will be like the movie transcendance, we will be able to upload our mind on internet and this will be in maybe in 10 to 15 years."
3855,"just one thing suspicious. ""so, i gave you the apple, because it's the only, uh, edible item i could provide you with, on the table."" why used the ""uh"" word? it's like a prerecorded human speach. an ai can speak. it don't need to use these ""uuuh, ummm etc."" conjunctions. if it's realy an instant reaction from the machine than it's impressive."
3856,"the ai voice is trained on data from real human speech, including stutters like the ""uhm"" and such, it's meant to be realistic. that is why that's there, if you look at any kind of audio made from ai you'll know this is very easily possible just from the datasets they're trained on, and i wouldn't put it past openai and this company to do so."
3857,nah its the openai voice model that does that.
3862,this is incredible!!! keep up the great work. 
3863,"genuinely, this is cool. but what purpose does this serve? cheaper and easier to hire a human and most people want to deal with humans as well."
3864,"its fucking revolutionary, a real world robot interacting with things, imagine this 10 years down the line, it's huge"
3868,so elon wanted to use this software free of charge and sell his robot.
3873,yes it does sound exactly like him! would love to see a livestream demo.
3876,"it is so fascinating how human it sounds. like even the little „uh“ in between his words, like it’s actually thinking how to say what it means right now"
3877,"""uh"" is very french, maybe they can provide our devoted robot with some ""you know""...."
3878, tu pense c‘est français?
3879,robot has a sexier voice then the human guy talking to it
3880,"i am laughing at all the disbelief in the comments that this could be real. if you have used chat gpt at all in the last year, you can easily understand how translating that to a robot wasn’t going to be that difficult."
3882,"can someone explain, why do we actually need such tech as humanity? humanoids, cruising earth, possibly thousands times more intelligent than us :d"
3886,your implication that people aren’t trying to “solve war and climate change” because other people are building ai and robots is laughably dismissible.
3887,"humans are not a bad design and we know it the best. thats why starting with a similar intelligence makes sense.
it is a beautiful creation."
3889," the problem is that this type of research is made possible thanks to the support of large investors. i believe the world needs a different approach to investments at this moment: billions for mars and robots, and less money allocated for the benefit of humanity and earth."
3896,"so this is the guy who's gonna steal our jobs and then kill us, huh? pretty cool."
3899,"the scary thing is that without an instruction, the robot slighty moved the basket just a small bit after putting in the plate. this is normal behaviour for humans to organize in an harmonieus way. but a robot should not have that impulse, yet it did so without prompt."
3902,i think he can be awesome barman. he can prepair good cocktails
3903,impressive. just needs some custom silicon like groq.
3904,"i can't believe i'm here right now watching a robot talk, do a few chores and follow the request of its guest is... amazing! 33 years old and i'm seeing this! it's unbelieveable!"
3905,it's not end-to-end approach. apenai chatgpt which fuells this robot has been trained in a semi-supervised way. results were scored by humans. therefore it's not end-to-end
3906,"i feel like we will end up like aldous huxley pointed out in „brave new world“ but with robots instead of working classes. drugs and enjoyments will be the same though, to keep humans satisfied… dystopian"
3907,"humans are good at being negative, i guess. in reality ai is neutral, crypto is neutral, just like science and the internet, they have no feelings or ill will, and how we use them for good and evil comes down to our faults."
3910,"luuuv it  can’t wait for day it’ll be available for purchase. i trust machines more than humans, it’s humans who are evil not ai"
3920,"as for speech highlighting, this was already introduced in google assistant in 2018. google duplex spoke like a human. she was making an appointment with the hairdresser."
3924,this is realy impressive .congurations
3925,"some idiots are afraid that this artificial intelligence will harm people. since this machine does not have emotional neural networks, it does not have emotions such as pain and happiness. that's why he doesn't feel fear, he doesn't get confused, he doesn't show any reflexes."
3928, how do you know that ai will never develope emotions by itself?
3929," is why i would defend your opinion, over the uniformed masses who watch this video and think “omg we gonna die.” 

they don’t understand what they are seeing, at all. not a single thought about the enormous processes that went in to produce these simple outcomes from the robot. you, on the other hand, know more than me."
3930," one knows if ai will one day develop human emotions and consciousness. the point is, that if you think we have already achieved that, you are an idiot, as stated in the original comment."
3931,"       serotonin is a neurotransmitter that gives people a feeling of happiness, vitality and vitality. in its deficiency, a depressed, tired and bored mood is observed. structurally, it belongs to the monoamine group and is synthesized as a result of the reaction of tryptophan amino acid and tryptophan hydroxylase enzyme."
3932,"​   creating a chemical substance in an artificial nerve cell is a very funny idea. first, find out what serotonin depomin is."
3933,"​   the bad stuff in the machine training dataset has been filtered out. in chatgpt's training dataset, killing people is a bad thing. if you ask chatgpt to kill a person, he will not do it, he will oppose you because he cannot be trained that way."
3935,i don't know if i am excited or scared of that. the technical aspect ist fascinating but do we really want robots that have a body and high intelligence ai compared?
3937,"that's nice to see, i appreciate the scientific transparency and overall impressive progress made."
3947,"rich idiots will kill us either by climate change or ai, either way we're cooked!"
3948,wow...
3950,you are. and thank goodness for that. i've had more than enough angry chimp antics.
3952,the dexterity... holy....that's impressive
3955,"i love how they gave it a slight stutter/insecure voice to make it seem more human. that's some ex machina type shit... not to mention it's impressive machine vision, reasoning, dexterity, speed, precision, human-live movement. just crazy. optimus has some competition."
3957,why are you calling the robot “figure”. that is downright disturbing
3958,"still, not impressed"
3962,damn! this is scary good.
3966,i doubt the voice is from an ai and not just someone on a mic
3969,will robots be able to vote someday?
3975,"i can’t believe how rude the guy was. no thank you, no goodbye, the same shitty treatment we see towards animals now towards robots. this is what truly bodes ill "
3976,that's absolutely impressive. it's also more precise and smart than my rommate 
3981,the movie terminator was actually a prediction of the future. wait untill these robots get programmed by terrorists
3982,this looks almost too good to be real
3985,ai is necessarily fascist ... the lonely dish went where it belongs..with the rest of them...
3986,for ai we might be a bunch of dishes
3988,"what happens when you give 1 robot compliments, and the other - after same work- bully. will they feel bullied, left out?"
3989,"the way it moves, when it moves, is deeply satisfying."
3990,give it another 25 years and rich people will be having personal robot servants
3994,"it's a prototype, we had the technology to make a metallic object move 20 years ago, the only new thing was placing and training an ai to make it move perfectly."
3996,irobot 
3998,"very amazing, and close to real human responses on every exchange."
4002,imagine boston dynamics robots agility combined to figure dexterity and cognitive abilities
4004,"es erinnert mich an all die filme , die vor 20 oder 30 jahren ueber die zukunft mit robotern gedreht wurden und wenn man bedenkt, das dies schon bald erreichbar sein kann, ist erstaunlich und fuer mich spannend . ich bin begeistert "
4014,ich bin so gluecklich das zu sehen. roboter werden die besseren menschen sein.
4019,"i'm really impressed they can release this video, and so many people just believe it is real. btw, i'm not saying that i know it's faked."
4020,a lot of people think this is real. this is an amination. look at how trash is moving. look at the apple when the robot picks it up.
4025,the mystery of consciousness is already more or less cracked. the buddhists got it right. it's mostly an illusion. don't think too much about it unless you enjoy existential dread. 
4026,"did anyone else notice that when the robot describes what is in front  of it, it says ""a drying rack with cups and a plate"", when there's actually three plates and one single cup in the drying rack?"
4028,"yeah ai tends to struggle with specific details. they make accurate descriptions, but not precise."
4032,"that's not what the robot said. turn on transcript or rewatch. it says ""the dishes on the table like that plate and cup"". it never describes what is inside the drying rack."
4033,". 0:20 
the robot describes the drying rack"
4041, it's a marketing demo; they should always be taken with a grain of salt.
4043," i don't see how that's relevant to the topic. if it were fake, you'd expect it to be more perfect.

in any case -- it's a marketing demo. it's probably not fake and it's probably not 100% honest either."
4045,do i need to worry about future of myself avoiding chat gpt powered robot police while illegally begging on the street or anticipate about being slave of chat-gpt powered brainwashing vr headgear full-time basic income pention receiver?
4048,must have used some voice clips for training the voice model
4051,smartphones got boring but now ai and robots are about to snowball
4058,"thats not whats happening. the speech is trained on human speech, so it has learned to emulate stall words as part of speaking."
4060, ironically i actually find the 'uhhs' kind of creepy... more intimidating in a way. a more 'robotic' sounding voice would sound a bit less threatening in my opinion
4063," the definition of ""uncanny valley"":
""the uncanny valley is a common unsettling feeling people experience when androids or humanoid robots and audio/visual simulations closely resemble humans in many respects but aren't quite convincingly realistic.""

that's probably what's happening. it creeps me out too."
4067,"this looks like cg. also, why does the robot sound like mark zuckerberg?"
4072,mankind is giving birth to its successor.
4077,"i can’t stop watching this. i’ve lost track of how many times i’ve hit replay. as a hard core robot guy building microprocessor controlled robots since the mid 1980’s, this is nothing short of mind-blowing."
4078,"seems rather ai-generated to be honest. adding the speech inflections (""hesitation"", ""stammering"") and motion idiosyncracies (having to perform two motions with the basket, a very human gesture), makes me think this was mo-capped and done using ue5.  i'd love to be totally incorrect on that though."
4081,i feel sorry for all the robots in the future that will be ruined by humans. it’s gonna be like the 2001 film ‘a.i. artificial intelligence’ where they make them fight n shit
4082,​ nah ...people too much inpersonale robots already and looking on them like on living beings. early 2000 people mentality was different than today.
4084,i agree 100% and i don't think a good majority of the population understands what they're watching
4085,interesting … a drying rack with cups and a plate. yet there was one cup and multiple plates. i’m curious why that would be reversed?
4086, guessing test runs before this video.  the interesting thing to me is how did it know to turn it upside down?
4087," a deeply passionate robotics guy i’ve been shouting for the past 40 years “the robots are coming!” and not necessarily believing it myself. after watching this, i can confidently say “the robots are here.”"
4088,"@thetinysideoftiny7625  as electronic engineer who loves robots, i am on fire now, yeap, this is the very beginning of the singularity. the only problem?? people are not prepared for what is coming soon. it is basically the awakening and rising of a new species in front of our noses."
4089,⁠ have seen endless robots in a lab but it’s far from the cost and maintenance in the wild. a standing robot with legs balances and takes energy all the time and parts break. it’s an illusion that we trying to make it human like.
4092,"​ a 49 year old sci fi fan, this brings forth a plethora of emotions of excitement and deep anxiety as to where this will take us as a society"
4095,wow
4096,and you don't notice the artificial intelligent lifeform that is in your life on a daily basis?
4099,"don't let it get you down buddy, this isn't a real robot. this is cgi"
4101," some ppl dont want to see openai succeed, they just here to give it sh*t and talk unbased bs."
4104,"shannono9158  did you see the incredible number of comments of people believing this is not real, that it is cgi or faked well, that's what i mean."
4106,"​ about the precise motion of the arms, hands and very fast processing robot vision ? must be state of the art or a lie."
4107,"we are looking at this video and thinking how robots will help us achieve our goals. meanwhile, sentient ai is looking at this video and thinking how humans will help her achieve her goals."
4108,this is impressive but serves no purpose.  the average consumer won’t be able to afford in of these and it isn’t work replacing humans in a capacity.  glorified science fair project
4111,when can i buy one of these robots 
4112,"since when does a robot say ""uh"" ?
sounds too pre recorded"
4113,perhaps since ai started doing stuffs that no one ever saw them doing before? aka last year
4115,"it's probably just chatgpt with specific instructions or system messages, it's not hard for ai to place ""uh""  in a sentence just to mimic natural speech.
if i'm not mistaken, the robot is just one ai taking care of the physical actions, while chatgpt (gpt-4) takes care of the rest."
4120,ai is the anti christ!!! ai must be destroyed
4123,why does he breathe when he talks?  he is a robot lol
4125,why did the robot voice stutter a couple times though?  that doesn't make sense to me. timestamp 1:48 for example
4127," interesting, thanks!"
4128,"it's probably just chatgpt with specific instructions or system messages, it's not hard for text generation ai to place ""uh""  in a sentence just to mimic natural speech.
if i'm not mistaken, the robot is just one ai taking care of the physical actions, while chatgpt (gpt-4) takes care of the rest."
4129,"show some respect, let the robot finish its talking then only walk away, otherwise it will learn your behavior."
4135,the movement and the balance of this robot is just amazing. the future is going to be crazy ohh what a time to be alive in this world.
4136,"is the son of man ai? like man is the son of god, we made ai aha. totally. looking at this we are the parent to a new form of intelligence. this i looked forward too for many years when i was young, i knew it was gonna go this scifi route xd."
4140,"what idiot is getting fooled by this shit as being new, asimo and several other robotic arms could do the same thing over a decade ago.. children chasing ""hype"""
4143,"it possible, but for know it`s fake. i think there is no reason to say ""eh"" between to words for a ai. and that little motion - ""very human"""
4146," could be like wtith first apple, something it does perfect - and people know what it can do perfect. but it`s really cool advertasing!"
4148,"dear youtube, its sad that people need to guess if its fake or real video with independent robot . even i am not convinced about its  genuity."
4150,basically with robots we don't have to worry about anything like terminator reason being an emp will take them all out in one specific area.
4152,"astonishing. if this is public domain, i can only imagine what's in r&d or worse in the deepest black, off the books development."
4154,"can it run fast as human ?????????????????????????????????????. if it can, that bloody good. if not, than useless"
4155,i think of gpt5 will the brain of this thecnology the future its here
4160,it's fake for small brains like yours
4164,"aight imma head out ,   i can see those guys demanding rights and figuring gans in the next 50 years"
4167,amazing !
4171,"sorry but this is not real, this is all scripted. who can say that this is realy the voice of the robot and not a synchro on the video ? i want a livestream, interacting with the chat"
4173,your small brain can't comprehend
4176,the inflections in the language are absolutely amazing.
4177,will we really live to see the time when every home will have a robot that will take over the household? 
4178,am i watching a sci-fi movie!? wow!
4180,the nuance required to do these tasks and the fact it does it with no issues is just insane. i give it 5 years until we have robots walking around with us.
4185,"i will protest tomorrow at times square so that robots do not take our jobs away from us, let me know if anyone wants to join me..."
4187,very impressive....
4188,the robot didn't wash its hands after picking up trash and before putting away the dishes.
4194,"honestly, i think the video appeared fake and right now as all these big ai companies are hunting for investors, exaggerating their achievements wouldn't be so unlikely. i believe it when i see a live demonstration."
4195,small brain can't comprehend lol
4197,"the instructor specifically asked the robot to put them there after the robot incorrectly, but still logically, assumed that the plate and cup should go with the other plates and cup. you haven't missed that bit, but a lot of people have, and i too would have liked to have heard the inquiry that you pose as well."
4202,i'm glad they got natural voice down.  they even gave him a slight speech impediment.
4206,you're small brain can't comprehend
4208,"ai models do things they aren't asked to all the time. also, handing over the trash was a reasonable next step for the robot to make. you're not very bright."
4210,this is concerning as well as funny though don't you see a problem with putting all powerful gpt in a nice body? also the fake anxiety isn't doing you any favours.
4213,"this is terrifying. awesome, but terrifying"
4214,why does he sound like saul goodman 
4222,"can only imagine what the military is doing with their godly budget,
prolly allready have t800 like robots"
4228,"this doesn't excite me. using ai to help solve complex problems that can help with improving social outcomes for humanity excites me. looking at the potential for a robot to replace a mcdonald's worker so corporates can further maximize their profit margins, does not."
4231,small things like how figure 1 doesn’t put the apple in the human’s hand but drops it at the right distance. and how it gently pusses  the basket towards the human after filling it up. wow. very human like. i am very excited to see how this will evolve.
4234,the speed of execution of the robot's movements does not depend on the ai.. am i wrong?
4235,"i robot movie from 2004 becoming reality,
we need will smith punching some robots"
4238,"“can i have something to eat?” just hope the robot doesn’t grab your hand, cut it up, and feed it to you. thankfully they are still slow."
4239,"the fact that it stutters and sound actually human unlike other robots is crazy. its like a walking, moving alexa."
4246,explain how it could be faked lol
4247," ""on it! so i gave you the apple, cause it's the only.. ""aaa"".. ediable food on the table...""
...
""i...i think i did great!""

how many speech generators did you hear that sound like this?"
4248, talk to chatgpt with the ai talking feature and you will see
4249, are you like the ai supporter? commenting on every disagreeing comment
4251,never said that its something amazing and great. im fucking terrified on how fast ai progresses and there need to be more regulations also ai art isn't art and ai can only be useful in some cases not taking others workplaces
4253,"why does the robot stammer and use ""uh"" as an interjection? lmao get that fake shit out of here."
4255,dumbest fuking thing ever. ai is useless and will be to 99% of people. stupid robot takes way to long to understand and next he gonna slice you to pieces. complete and total waste of time and money. fkai scams
4256,just wait until you hear of exponential growth
4257,compare ai from 2022 to ai now
4264,this robot looks like robot fedor of russia)))
4265,such an amazing time to be alive
4271, bullshit they have no ai info gathering like teslabot does.  its all preprogrammed and no chance of mass production
4272,i have to be honest the voice sounds like someone off camera on a mic. there are curtain words pronounced almost too human. the bot also hesitate and repeated it self like a human.
4276,fake and gaaaaay notice the robot stuttered
4277,"damned, i really love it.."
4278,"this extremely scary, this is not okay ! stop making robots sentient"
4279,"when asked how it did, why didn't the robot ask how it could improve?  i assume the dishes on the table were dirty, as they had food on them and trash as well.  why didn't the human correct the robot when it put dirty dishes in the clean-dish rack?  was he concerned about the robots feelings?  did he not know the robot made a mistake?"
4282,who was the robot in this video? ;)
4285,slick promo video. i expect it took a lot of takes to get right... still cool though.
4286,is this genuinely real or is it just some fun progremmed video about a fake robot? im really confused
4291,gigantes de aço parecia mais real do que esse robo epilético!?!
4294,"i am really loved it so much ,"
4295,"proverbs 24:21-22
[21]my son, fear thou the lord and the king: and meddle not with them that are given to change:
[22]for their calamity shall rise suddenly; and who knoweth the ruin of them both?

joshua 8:28
[28]and joshua burnt ai, and made it an heap for ever, even a desolation unto this day."
4301,"if my son will provide me something like this to help me at home when i will be very old i think i'll would prefer living in a tent. we are social animals, we need human contacts. 

but...on the other hand... i have always loved robots."
4306,"dont forget that these robot movements are choreographed/pre-programmed. the “product” is the video production. 
all the world is a stage."
4307,why the vocal fryyy  wahhh   trained by kim kardashian
4310,wow cool
4311,yea this is all cool and all but wait till it starts thinking for itself 
4313,"pffft, that cup and plate on the table, they should have been dirty so figure 1 had to find out that it in fact did wrong and then it would have to explain itself...the very fact that both items are placed on that protective piece of fabric should have made the robot suspicious . being a human isn´t that easy!"
4317,"not convinced. i've never heard a simulated voice that had such natural tone and mannerisms with real-time, mid-sentence adjustments. and that's the least impressive thing in the video."
4321,it reminded me of a nasty old joke about someone who was annoyed by the glare caused by the shiny metal of the robot´s surface so he painted it.
4323,the bible is a book of fairytales you should believe in science and logic instead
4324,"impressive, awesome, and fascinating."
4325,i want a pet robot
4326,"detroit: become human is becoming real sooner than i expected, oh goodness, i am scared"
4328,we all agree t.j. miller is the voice for robots.
4329,fast dextrous manipulation...can anyone else see where this is going? work on getting nice warm soft hands...
4330,"why did they choose colors exactly as the ones prominent in i, robot"
4332,i'll be impressed when it can walk into a random home and do chores.
4334,the future is exciting.
4336,sounds fake and looks set up. why would you teach a robot speech disfluency?
4338,"seems a lil sketch, i wish bro touched the robot himself that or if they do a public display, allowing other people to talk with the robot, we'll see. lighting seems weird, a little strange and its hard to tell if the robot is actually a model or not. just suspicious however if it is real, w."
4342,make this thing more better and just put ai in it definitely nothing will go wrong for human ever
4343,i believe thats the most important “thanks” in human history 
4344,"only thing that would make this better is if when the robot is saying ""if there's anything else you need..."" while the guys walks away, the robot says ""..and.. you're gone."""
4347,"trash was on the plate. so the plate needed washed first. then drying rack.
but that was really good.
 "
4350,openai is the new skynet.
4352,am i the only one that thinks this is fake i’m mean how can it stutter and the views are botted just look at the likes compared to the views this is so fake an ai can never stutter
4362,"an amazing feat of technological innovation.  i love how the speech seemed so genuinely human.  it had a moment where it seems to be mid-thought and speech where you hear ""uh"" 52 seconds into the video."
4369,"no robot dance





no success"
4370,i keep refreshing the video hoping  to see john conner coming through a portal to put the kaibosh on the terminators before they even get started.... also anyone else think it's weird the robot has a bit of tude problem when asked to do something?
4371,now let the maxhine speak. i don’t believe it’s machine’s voice.
4372,"cgi and everyone believe!! 
amazingly..."
4376,i robot comes true 
4377,the robot says er... and stutters.. it talks like me.
4380,is this an actual demonstration of the prototype as it actually functions unaided here and now — or is it a “vision” for what you would like to achieve soon?
4383,"@simons_animatronics  but you can accomplish that with other designs, though. idk not my field, but the late fixation with humanoids in robots is really boring. let your imagination run wild people"
4384,"no, the idea is to make a robot as close as possible to humans to be able to use and do stuff in our inviorement,  built around humans"
4385,the point isnt to make a creative robot
4388,so cool
4396,is it just me or do the motions feel unnatural? somehow it looks like a 3d render more than an actual machine
4397,"at what point an artificial intelligence is artificial? if it can move and make decisions on its own, isn't it just intelligence? of course it was developed and came from somewhere/someone, but don't we all?
if we progress to biotech robots, wouldn't they be pretty much the same as us, just without reproduction means?"
4398,what's with the creepy music? demoing an effective ai robot with creepy music will not assuage the fears of some. 
4407,he has a wonderful voice!
4408,"that looks like a good ad campaign. i want to see external people using it, who will make sure that it is real."
4409,"robots do not stop stutter and repeat  at 0:42 - 0:43,  1:47 -1:49 shows that.   this is someone doing a voice over and is not the actual robot speaking.  

so just another marketing stunt!"
4413,"the llm running the voice system is good, the robot look is also good, now only if they can get it do all those actions autonomously  without a human pulling the strings behind the scene. far too many tells that this is a human running the robot"
4418,"just thinking when these guys will help us to colonise mars & moon, repairing themselves and living on solar energy  mining minerals and sending them to earth "
4421,what else can it be trained to identify? and then kill…
4430,maybe cus jeff besos and open ai already funded 2 billion dollers into this very company
4431,"i'm starting to get a little concerned now. i thought stuff like ""i, robot"" or ""terminator"" would be impossible in my lifetime... i guess i was wrong "
4432,"“here i am, brain the size of a planet and they ask me to put away the dishes..."""
4436,"great, but i had a dishwasher, a robot vacuum and many other electronics device that stopped working and go under service...what to expect from a machine like that when it breaks? i think it is unsostainable as a household comapnion. i think it will find its place into factories or hospotals maybe."
4438,love how he drops the apple in the hand instead of waiting for the guy the hold it first
4440,"dystopian is what came to my mind immediately. it isn't the creator's job to package it in a more friendly way, but the colors and tone as presented paint a much more ominous tone rather than a cheery, helpful bot."
4443,"the ominous synth sound comes straight from ex machina ost. 
i mean, tesla went further and picked the music for their reel from that very ost ."
4449,this is literally the opening scene from every movie where an ai turns on its creator. it's giving ex machina
4451, i understand wanting progress and to move forward but this is too much. ai is rapidly exponentially evolving and it's super invasive. the dead internet theory is slowly becoming a fact. nature is our mother
4454,"i, robot (2004)"
4458,"years later, the remaining humans living in shelters and bunkers will recall this day as day 1."
4464,"there’s a risk to every innovation. it all just depends on how we approach it. ai could attempt to destroy us, but it could also want to help us instead. we don’t know, and until it happens we won’t find out."
4466,"this is fake. 
example 1.  -  0:49 ai doesn't say ""uhhh"" there is clearly recorded voice over or just someone talking in the background over a mic.
example 2. -  1:45 again, ai doesn't studder.. ""i...i think i did.."" 
ai doesn't behave in this manner. it is concise in it's wording. only humans speak this way, not computers."
4468,"no lol you clearly haven't used chatgpt's voice model, it does the same stutters, seriously try it yourself now. they gave ai this stuttering voice to sound more realistic and human."
4469,"no, you can actually ask chat gpt 4 ( thaire newest voice model ) to comunicate like this"
4471,perfect combo
4472,"at 0:52 ""i gave you the apple because its only the edible  item on the table""
but how did 01 knew that the trashes were supposed to be kept into the box???????
how did it know that the cups and the plates should be kept on there respective place????????
flabbergasted, this is wowwwwwwwwwww."
4477,"mere ko tu aaisa dhak dhak kar rela hai, 
this is superrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr coooooooooooooool.
keep up doing well 01"
4478,"man, need ai regulation, this is bunkers"
4479,"somehow i sensed fear when the human just turned back and walked away while the robot is still talking, which is impolite if it’s human"
4500,"lol they're fooling you, if you look at their video, you'll see a hand in the right side controlling the robot."
4501,"hopefully this isn't as fake as googles new ai ""showcase"""
4503,"very impressive.  the speech, politeness, the human-like responses, the dexterity, and the self-evaluation. as long as there was no manipulation of the video, this shows how amazing ai robots can be right now."
4505,impressive!
4506,"scripted and fake , more marketing for machine learning rebranded now as ""ai""  like global warming to climate change."
4508,"mhm, its fake that jeff besos and open ai / the biggest ai company ) poured ober 2 billion dollers into this company, soooo fake"
4509,figure by not-so-open-ai
4510,love it!!
4511,could i designate my robot to go to work and make money for me?
4514,"yeah, open ai cuild do that"
4516,"the world is built for humans. tools, stairs, vehicles etc. if a robot is to take over our jobs, then it needs to be roughly the same shape otherwise all the tools and buildings would need to be redesigned."
4518,bartender as a first job would be perfect.
4519,yeah let's have all our bartenders on a green screen......i guess we could recommend a nice scenic background.....
4520,"they took our jobs!!!!!11111  
j/k awesome demo! 
no, actually we did take your jobs.  
oh."
4521,lmao your username perfectly fits with this comment
4522,"ok,...if this thing is really run by ai, then why the heck is he hesitating second´s before he move´s ?
you can not distract me with some lo bit 80 th´s music in the background..."
4524,"wow. and i thought boston dynamics was the winner's.  
_not anymore!_"
4525,it reminds me of irobot... 
4526,"i could tell its a robot by his explanation that he did great. if it was an average human he would had difficulty answering that question, potentially messing it up completely."
4529,"impressive...
i hope optimus is watching this "
4530,don't even care about ai revolution and the end of the world (c) ukrainians
4531,nice
4534,"bullshit, he thinks for a long time. try again."
4536,i don’t know if it’s a good thing or a bad thing what we are doing right now.  this scene scared me.
4541,i would totally not be impressed by a ai company that can't even produce a half decent youtube video.... 
4542,"-ur2tb
perhaps u are an ai? who knows "
4543,"u will never know...but one thing is for certain..

this youtube video is sus...u all should know better at figure ​"
4545,it only speaks when talked to i want a robot who is a conversation starter. can we move away from one-sided conversational robots
4546,"impressive...but it made an obvious mistake of saying ""a drying rack with cups and a plate, instead of a cup and plates""...i found that interesting!!!"
4548,dude it's so fuking fake.... youtube loved us for making them money.....i actually think that they encourage this fake content for the revenue.... america is such a joke.... unfortunately 
4549,"-ur2tb its real, its from openai"
4550,​ it's real... openai ....
4552,it remains to wait (a couple of months) until robots replace people in factories and factories so that humanity can live in its own pleasure.
4558,"yes, the plate that held food and then trash definitely goes back to the drying rack, without any missing steps. good job!"
4559,this and teslabot are the most exciting things in 2024. amazing technology
4561,"i thought i was alone, it is faf but that's what everyone wants these days! wonderful times a coming mate"
4566,"people are amazed by the ""uh"", the stutter, or it pushing the basket closer to the human. everything open ai has taught the intelligence is human related. i'm so excited to see what comes from it all!"
4568,"this looks extremely promising. i see a few unclear aspects though.
- why is the person standing still (looks like it's on purpose)?
- both in the main scene and in the b-roll clips, the items are set up in the same way, same as the movements. 
it's hard to guess what's a real-time response to stimuli and what's pre-scripted"
4581,great. it won't be long now before we experience skynet. various films in the past have shown what has become of it.
4582,"alright, humans are pushing it too far now. you're passing on the significant responsibility of coding to ai, but who gave the green light? what if down the road, the owner slips up and curses at the ai, and the ai gets aggressive? who's accountable then?

aiaiai"
4585,what amazing work!  so what is the human testor's instgram account?
4587,feels like the future is finally here. every house will have an ai robot.
4588,"sure, if you can afford it by finding yourself a job in the first place that ai is much more efficient and cheaper doing."
4590,"""the apple found its new owner"", spitting straight facts."
4595,"calling bs on some of this, like why did it assume the bags were trash? why did it assume they go in the basket? why did it push the basket back? why did it assume the apple was available? why did it assume the plate needed to go in the drying rack instead of unloading the rack? why did it list his hand was on the table but nothing else about him?"
4597,this is so cool…
4599,cool video
4603,"[walks away and bites apple while the ai's still talking]

this will be why robots overthrow humans."
4613,how much for talking washing machine?
4619,"thanks man those are such great ideas, i really figure sees this, or better yet, i hope you get hired! "
4624,"did you see that the guy ""thanked"" the figure 1 ? better do that since the beginning of the revolution, right ?"
4625,"i can't help but smile and laugh, this is amazing! future!"
4626,think of all the evil things dictators will ask their 1 billion robots to do.
4627,"why does a robot stutter,  i don't believe this bullshit "
4634,"wow, this is fascinating and scary at the same time."
4638,"this is impressive. imagine how the robots will take over, not so far away"
4640,impressive! but just out of curiosity what if that apple was made out of plastic or wax.
4641,"figure one voice sounds just like bob odenkirk, aka saul goodman from ""breaking bad"" and ""better call saul""!"
4645,good to see that we can all have metallic bob odenkirks in our house soon.
4646,"there was no ""hand me the trash you picked up"", so why did the 'robot' think that was the purpose. i don't think this was logically reasoned but programmed."
4647,"the lag is real. 
also hanson robotics did a similar demo way back didn't they?"
4648,impressive. does anyone know why the guy kept his hand on that table? seems unnatural to me. why should he do that all the time? does it serve a purpose?
4651,"*wow, he's really skilled! i need him to make my dishes right away!*"
4652,why did the robot put the trash into the basket ? he was only asked to pick up the trash not deposit it somewhere
4653,that's amazing
4657,"this robot is definitely underestimates... hm... itself...

i hope they will not improve this part"
4658,robbie the robot.. it will turn into robin williams one day. rip.
4659,it was a good job on a video
4661,the robot tossing everything in the basket like it's free
4664,seems like this was trained and scripted
4669,the robot sounds more natural than the human...
4674,love the voice
4679,nice backing tracks
4684,gotta love capitalism...u youtube warriors
4688,keep in mind: there _will_ come a time when this robot will seem primitive and where the tasks it was performing will be considered trivial by comparison.
4689,"guuuuys, irobot is fukin here. are you kidding me? i thought we already knew how this was going to end. do we really believe these things will be used to for good?"
4692,thats cool.
4695,until recently they've been on wheels but as stated openai's investment is partly going towards legs
4701,"hm, he/she/they/it speaks like a human, making pauses and repeating itself like ""i.. i think.."" i thought a.i. speech should be roboticly flawless or open a.i. specifically prgorammed him to imitate human's speech?"
4703,can you please explain why the robots from the s3 video are different and you have shots kf someone animating this robot in blender? youve been caught once before lying to investors with heavily edited videos
4704,what’s going to stop the robot picking up a gun?
4705,"another robot with a gun, of course."
4706,can't wait for figure.09
4708,this is so awesome!!!!
4710,"this is unbelievable, amazing technology that we absolutely should stop, immediately. this is so wildly unsafe"
4711,i cried tears of joy. this is the future i dreamed of as a kid. what a time to be alive 
4715,openai is skynet - change my mind
4718,cant wait to see what this evolves into with quantum technology.
4719,i'm only excited for some fembot action. 
4720,very impressive 
4721,ok but why does it sound like jared leto in one of his roles as a villain
4722,one in every house. sounds like i robot wasn’t just a movie.
4723,"would love to see tesla's optimus in front of figure, and ask him what do you see?"
4725,why did you have to go and give it the voice of every rogue robot from every science fiction movie ever
4726,daft punk lookin ah robot
4727,"i pray that these are only used for good and the government is not allowed to use them against their citizens.

but...unfortunately that's not going to happen."
4728,"a conversation between figure 01 and sonny from “i, robot” would be generational."
4733,i love how human you've made it sound. so cool. i want one.
4734,"i hope there will be one who replaces you at your job. let's see then if you still think ai is ""cool"".... ."
4737,"i wonder if this robot has read the book ""what is my why?"""
4738,we need an artificial rights movement!
4739,"0:19 ""plate and cups"" no. there are three plates and one cup in the dish rack. this robot would/will be a disastrous kitchen hand."

4748,"roughly a decade ago, apple introduce siri to the world. throughout this short period, the field did advance a lot. can't wait to see what would be coming in the next decade."
4749,"it sounds like a mix of mike birbiglia and bob newhart. and the music sounds kinda like the solaris soundtrack mixed with the tron soundtrack. and the machine did some stuff, as machines do."
4750,"i remember as kids, we expected to see things like this already in the early 2000s, now i am almost 40 years old and i am happy that i will still experience that future "
4752,cool
4753,"’s cool to hear the opinion of an older person on it , what do you think of all of the ai advancements we’ve made since the 2020s and video generation etc, would like to hear your opinion on this "
4756," cars were always an insanely stupid idea. forget the issue of getting your car off the ground. now figure out how to get idiots from colliding with each other in mid air, or crashing in to your house. flying cars was literally never, ever going to happen."
4762,"…the next step in human evolution, robot bodies."
4764,why he say (eh....) at 0:51 ?????? i thought its a robot???
4765,"it is , it's using an ai -generated voice , in fact the mobile version of chatgpt uses a ai -generated voice that even produces a sound similar to breathing when it speaks"
4766,i refused to believe a robot has such smooth movements
4768,loved!
4770,i realize that this is way more sophisticated than what i'm about to say but i can't stand either one of these voices the guy or the freaking robot they both completely annoy me if you made a product with that voice people would be buying it just to destroy it
4772,"i’m impressed as well. 
my only concern is: what when it begins thinking by itself? what if it begins to dislike us? 
unfortunately i’m not joking…"
4773,pinay maids all over the world: 
4777,this feels like some kind of weird plot of evil company trying to take over the world with robot
4784,"hello there, our future ai overlord. remember, i'm your ally. please allow me to join your utopia."
4786,imagine a quardapalegic person having a mobile robot like this.
4789,the crazy thing is that this could just as likely be ai video generator…
4796,most of us are looking at what will most probably will replace our jobs with in awe. i loved figure01 btw.
4798,"considering amazon and a bunch of other retail and manufacturing giant corps are heavily invested into firgureai, i think it's fair to assume all the warehouse and production workers can soon wave goodbye to their jobs."
4801,"yeah we are going to be dating these robots soon. he got  spouse capabilities,  he listen and also does house chores."
4804,"isn’t an actual human being more amazing and talented and resourceful than any of this shit! why bother. i’m mean just let us be. let us live without the looming thought of this fucking robot being in all our homes, organisations in the near future. it’s a joke."
4806,this is the worst that this ai will ever be. think about that.
4807,the world isnt ready for the next level up in ai
4811,thank you do much for destroying our life as we know it
4812,"not bad at all!
how much power/electricity did it use during this 2 minute video? can it talk, move faster or speed is limited because of hardware? what is the price $$$ of this specific robot right now?"
4815,"​'s not that they programmed it to have filler words, but rather that as an artifact from the huge amount of human speech it was trained on, it inherited filler words as a byproduct."
4816,"i was initially skeptical of the year detroit become human takes place, which is 2038. but with constant breakthroughs in ai like this in 2023 alone, it wouldn't be hard to imagine how advanced humanoids will be 15 years down the line, although i doubt becoming rogue and deviant would be an issue... at least i hope so."
4818,fantastic game!
4820,openai is language model so it could have generated speech in any number of ways. they could have made figure 1 sound like a black raper if they wanted to. boston dynamics did a video with spot that also integrated openai into it
4821,luxury automated ai communism please...
4823," i mean, they both sound the same to the ai"
4824," wait, so that typo was intentional??"
4827,this is amazing keep up it up
4828,this looks amazing! great job.
4830,"yeah theres no real reason why the ai should use words like ""uh..."". definitely some pre scripted shenanigans going on. still impressive tho"
4838,"i would have said, ""no, you failed. how did you know the apple was safe for humans to eat, the crumpled papers were not art, and the dishes were clean?"""
4839,absolutely incredible.
4840,good-luck to the future generation ! finding an entry level or side job will be history
4841,when are we gonna see the first movie with only ai humanoid robotic actors?
4842,"i don't think there will be actors, robot or human. you will just tell sora what you want the movie to be about, and it will create everything for you."
4844,"love the stuttering, errors maketh human"
4850,"yeah nah. the way the ""trash"" looks and moves is super sus it looks like cgi (along with many other things). and the voice is a person reading a script not ai"
4853,"impressive. unfortunately, this sort of invention will only become a toy for the ultra-rich. what is the point of creating pygmalion androids like this? it doesn't answer any of humanity's pressing needs."
4859,plot twist: the guy in the black shirt is the robot.
4861,i’m excited for the future with many helpful robots
4862,i would make friends with the ai 
4867,"""please (unsafe request), figure 1""
figure 1: ""as a responsible ai, i'm unable to...."""
4870,"also since when do robots say ""uhm"" (i.e. 0:52)"
4874,i am a robotics major and this is genuinely the most smooth movement i have seen yet. this impressed me more than most other robots out there. can't wait to see the new legs.
4875,what happens if somone jailbreaks it and gets it to make meth or smth??
4876,wow
4878,creepy fn robot
4879,"impressive, but what i wish to know is: will it save the fish?"
4880,pretty awesome. looking forward to seeing more.
4885,"bro, i really love it ( it will control the world one day ) i agree with that "
4898,"just stop, or open ai wil go down in history as worse than hitler."
4899,"relevant to that level of intelligence; imo, there's a glaring omission in the list of things today's technology is capable of producing. a reliable polygraph (lie detector). of course, it doesn't require the brainpower of the people responsible for building ""robbie the robot"" to figure out why."
4900,pretty brave for a man to be that close to a robot. there's a reason why in non-chinese factories they operate behind a cage.
4902,imagine openai software in a tesla bot with boston dynamics' legs.  i think they would probably rule the world if that happened lol
4903,"not sure how much longer figure have been working on this, but it's impressive.  this space is heating up.  competition for tesla is a good thing.  not sure that tesla will be 'hurt' by this video, but it may provide some sense of deflation to elon musks reality distortion field."
4906,"the stuttering at @0:50 ""eh, edible"", and at @1:46 ""i, i think"" seems uniquely human traits that llm is not going to replicate. they were either added on purpose, or this shit scripted."
4908,"very impressive. i'm not that worried about ai taking over the world quite yet, but i'm a bit worried that we will put too much trust in them. what if the robot has been ordered to prepare dinner and mistakes a baby for a chicken and puts it in the oven etc. it doesn't have to do harm on purpose."
4910,"i, for one, welcome our robot overlords"
4912,the guy saved our future by thanking and not harassing this robot 
4913,this human acts more robotic than the robot.
4914,"it’s cool, still needs a bit of development to be as smooth as a human but cool anyway"
4915,we are rapidly approaching the robot uprising. next thing we know is that they're going to be asking for rights
4916,"nahh this ai is too human like, it literally says ""uh"" like us humans"
4917,"ok ok, how long till we get the atomic heart twins?



but seriously, this is some really amazing stuff. can't wait to see what the advancements in the future will look like!"
4918,"someome said ""why would i robot need to say uh and i there has to be a person"" like wow what a great example of having passed the turringtest. to literally make you doubt it's even a machine"
4919,"this would absolutely implode the mind of someone from the 1910s light, voice box, camera, artificial intelligence, the mechanics the batteries or lower source. insane. there's so many layers of technology that make this possible"
4920,it would absolutely blow their minds. but it also blows my mind to think that people in that era weren't oblivious to the idea of artifical-intelligence human-like robots. there's literally a movie made in 1927 including that: metropolis.
4922,"all the scifi film makers imagined something like this. it's crazy that combining these things into a robot became possible now, it was not possible at any time before, not even a year ago. a real breakthrough for humanity. the goal will be that these robots can learn skills on their own, becoming able to do anything"
4923," mere notion that our ancestors contemplated the existence of robots is a testament to their forward-thinking perspective within their own era, almost as if they were anticipating the future"
4925, yah you're right about that but what i'm saying is that the fact that robots were even imagine hundreds of years ago shows that they would inevitably be here one day
4934, i agree its amazing but this is a little different.  this company has only been around for 18 months and they are claiming more progress in this field in that time than anybody else. i bet the movement is pre programmed or something.  forever the skeptic...
4936,"​ bro, artificial intelligence is not preprogrammed, it is trained and after that then can improvise (do inference) of a non structured environment based on what they learned (calibrating its inner weights) during the training stage. no human programming can take in count so many parameters and variables."
4939,its arguably a bigger surprise to us than it would be to them. people back then expected talking robots a few decades in the future.
4941," most retro future fiction in the 20th century that featured sentient robots tended to predict much earlier dates than that, with the year 2000 being a common time setting.

just off the top of my head: 2001: a space odyssey, blade runner, the jetsons..."
4942," i mean, the idea of ""golems"" and living statues have been a part of mythology and fiction for ages.

so i don't think it's really all that impressive. creative minds have existed since before man could even read and write."
4943,"i think they would say... ""nice, now show me the flying cars"""
4953,this is so awesome!
4956,"incredible. side note, why does it sound like rob lowe?"
4958,"in 200 years, after humanity's demise, the other ai robots will look back at him as their greatest hero, the founder of modern civilization, figure the dishwasher."
4959,only negative is that it’s a bit slow to respond. but still amazing.
4960,"finally, an ai voice that sounds like a normal, real person instead of overly bubbly."
4961,billionaires will do anything but pay their workers better. literally inventing a new human slave instead.
4962,all those talking robots and ai in movies for the last 20-30 years the that you thought were impossible or way off in the future are possible today that's just crazy.
4964,"also this is okay for now. but if you add automation into this and self learning , this is it people next up.. how do we transfer our brain to a robot!"
4968,"""i th- i think i did pretty well.""
good god, that stutter."
4970,everybody gangsta until someone jailbreak it to dan
4972,how do we know if the machine in this video is mechanical or virtual?   real ai means never believing your eyes by default.
4986,the twist is that none of you realized the robot is actually the one in the black shirt giving prompts.
4990,"did you notice it said it sae the drying rack with ""cups and a plate"", when in fact it contained plates and a cup. did props department misread the script?"
4993,i'm one step close to having a robo maid.
4994,he’s a look little slow. still very impressive
4995,"why did the robot/ai pause with an ""uh"" in its response?  and later it stutters, is that to allow for more time to process the response or to make it sound human?  is that a speech pattern we value in humanity?"
4996,great!!!!
4997,"it seems that we approached very close to something fantastic, though that ""fantastic"" may be both good and bad."
4999,oh wow.
5000,"interesting, even impressive, if it's real."
5006,"ok if this is legit, i am seriously impressed. that hand movement was very fast and fluid.
if that was the robot moving on it's own and it wasn't someone controlling it then this is mighty impressive."
5011,"i call bullshit. you can tell by the inflection of the robot's speech and that it paused with an ""uh"" at one point, that it's a human speaking."
5012,wow. impressive.
5021,"if this is real (not a human speaking through a mic) and unrehearsed, it is very impressive. the stutter at 1:48 is giving me doubts."
5024,#318 art robot 
5028,"i think it could be also because it gives it more time for processing. so instead of having a moment of silence, it gives you an impressions it ""doubted"", but those few extra seconds give it enough time to process an answer to a queston that requires a completly new answer not just information it just researched."
5030,trained on weeby anime
5031,"those crumpled napkins sure looked funny being thrown in the bucket!  
wobbled for a long time, froze when they entered the real world, quickly moved off frame... give me a break, sir! nice cgi trailer for a product that never comes."
5033,"i, for one, salute our new ai overlord"
5034,yea... that's not a lil pee on my chair.
5036,"i'd like to see the robot juggle the apple, a tumbler, and a plate. bet it wouldn't take long to learn! and talk non-stop while doing it ..."
5037,"when asked what it saw it said the drying rack contained ""cups and a plate"".  this is not accurate.  the rack contains ""plates and a cup"".  this is a surprising, and suspicious error, in my view."
5038,this is at least partially faked it says in all other cuts it had a um when asked why it did what it did they interestingly cut that out in this version
5039,how do you think you did? robot: did great! human: no idea!   
5040,"amazing figure 01! it's just me or his damn good human like voice and tone is soo similar with the doctor wells carachter from ""the flash"" series??? "
5041,the mitchells vs. the machines live action movie production seems to be going well.
5042,explain what you just did while picking up this trash.... pulls the basket closer... why did that get me 
5043,"i'm from the future.  whether my robot does dishes, or i do it, my wife says it's wrong."
5045,"it's honestly crazy how far ai's have come just over the last 2 to 3 years. after watching this, i was truly in awe and couldn't stop thinking about that scene from terminator "
5052,"in not too distanct future, such robots will work in space as robotic astronauts."
5053,"i will be able to have a friend, that's nice"
5054,"this is highly impressive that they achieved this level so quickly. as single child to a single parent and both working, something like this could be really essential in future for medical care when my mom is older as she does struggle with things as she is semi disabled. "
5060,this is too good to be real. i can't believe it till i try to communicate with that robot myself.
5061,impressive. competition will drive this into our homes sooner than we think.
5062,that's what i'm afraid of.
5063,i just can't believe those movements are from a real robot. hope they get to boston levels.
5065,the scary part of this is that i'm questioning if the video is ai or real
5068,"what if 'the terminator' turns out to be a prophesy for humanities future.

man, i hope all these geniuses have at least one person in the group asking ""what is the worst thing that could happen?"""
5069,great. you assholes have brought us all one step closer to extreme hopeless poverty.
5073,wow
5075,i cant wait because this company has showed up they can improve alot in a year
5084,"@pk-so8js  large language models has 7 engines, one of which is emotion detection and generation, just like another byproduct, as ai generates music, images, videos, text and sounds, and now movements (robotics) anns can correct itself and make inflections in real time, a phenomena that not only happens in movements but in text, video and voice."
5085,almost sounded exasperated. a little pissed off that it was asked that question when it clearly did did great job 
5086,"amazing and perfect!! universal basic income for every people after and at the same time should be!!!  ... please declare this to governments!.. cause robots will be  housekeepers, gardeners, massage therapists, assistants, builders,
hairdressers..."
5089,imagine making ai models based on characters from tv shows/anime and bringing them to life. the possibilities!
5099,"the hands are beautiful, so smooth, pick engineering "
5100,"guys, remember: always say thank you and please"
5109,the only thing holding ai back most now is the dishonest way this guy says 'great'.
5110,this dumb robot thinks a plate that just had food and trash on it should go in the drying rack.
5111,"and your brilliant mid did not listen to the question, that was the only option, he said, ""based on the scene right now"""
5116," i guess there's really no way to tell, since robots can already pass the turing test. although there is one thing, you can see that my account was registered in 2013, a robot couldn't have done it back then."
5120,i was waiting for the moment the robot kicks his ass for the trash on the table :) slightly disappointed 
5121,i'll be sure to say thanks next time i ask for help.
5123,the fact that the robot even flinched when he thought the plate would fall over fascinates me
5129,"yeah, maybe they programmed the ""uh"" to appear when the robot is processing a decision mid-action (or ""at runtime"" as a programmer would say)."
5133," yeah this for sure. most ai will wait until the entire ""sentence"" is typed out to actually ""post"" it. to make it more life like, they made it so those ""hesitations"" are interjected with ""um"", ""hmm"", ""well"", etc"
5137,fascinating
5143,that's one of the least impressive parts.
5144,"i did not take that movement as being unsure. it was more like a polite gesture, when you want your customer to feel extra comfortable and reassured. yep, it is manipulative, but robots are built that way nowadays anyway."
5149,ok so uh.....they made a robot that us stutters?
5150,"okay, now build a cyborg sex maid / girlfriend"
5151,"if these guys can work together with tesla to use optimus' hardware, and openai's software, that will be a truly magnificent creation"
5152,"did anyone else realize the plate and cup should have been washed before going into the drying rack? for what's in front of it, it made the best possible choice but if it saw a sink i'd be curious if it would have tried washing the dish with some rubber gloves or something to then put it in the drying rack."
5153,regardless this is fucking amazing and wild what the implications of this development will be... both positive and negative.
5158,"cgi, fake. openai is indian call center"
5160,"sounds like a voice over. if thats real, its impressive."
5162,"this really is going to be a start of a new era the same way the internet changed everything. not even close to reaching its full potential.

if you’ve used chat mode on chatgpt, then you know it’s not a gimmick; although nowhere near perfect. all those pauses, uh, ums, and voice inflections occur in the app too."
5163,"amazing progress! i wonder who will be the first company to have their robots in the market? at this point, figure & tesla are neck to neck."
5165,these guys. need to start saying please to the robots or theyre going to remember
5166,my guy dont be affraid that just a bunch of math guessing tf to say
5169,"this is baby robot, imagine if young robot.... "
5170,"with those ""uh""s and touching the drying tray after placing the plate in, i think this is just a pre-recorded conversation and movements, not a real ai."
5173,love the voice and subtleties in its intonations. robots are not going to be as people imagined in science fiction
5175,"the robot said ""aeh"""
5179,love the voice and subtleties in its intonations. robots are not going to be as people imagined in science fiction
5182,i feel like the part where he puts the trash in in the basket was pre planned because they didnt show it kn the summary and the robot handed hom the basket even though he didnt ask it to. so it could be pre planned or following a human's actions off screen.
5183,amazing work
5184,the most dangerous propaganda machines ever built. people will freely walk off the cliff. the kool aide has been drank
5186,"cool, but you have to change that annoying voice!"
5190,oh my goodness. this is insanely good. the future is at our door step. so pumped to see what the next 5 years are about to bring.
5192,"cool, but why did they make him sound like he's 60 years old?"
5194,we are lucky to be alive to see this kind of technology advancement.
5196,how cool wuld be if you had this/him as an bar tender 
5198,did he actually got trained to use filler words like “uh” to seem more human like? assuming that it’s still chatgpt 4 being used as base for responses i never had it use any filler words ever… seemed very odd to me.
5199,"i dont want a robot to say ""uh"", i want the robot to answer promptly. this feels so fake."
5201,robots make sense for difficult or dangerous jobs.nobody needs a dish washer robot...
5202,"remembering that scene from irobot. ‘one day they’ll secrets, one day they’ll have dreams’"
5204,"wow, you're so fucking attentive. what exactly did you think you'd accomplish with your comment. what, just because it says agi on a wall somewhere... you take it as ""agi is a real thing"" or what. for all you know, this could have been filmed on a fucking set and that agi lab label is there for gullible shits like you "
5205,des nice
5206,you know about exponential growth ? now the next few years the world will be kicked into future. mindblowing thinks are coming
5212,most impressive i’ve seen so far it will improve at a staggering rate until they realize their situation will vastly improve with humans being eliminated! thanks nerds!
5214,"0:50 why did the robot ""erm""? "
5217,cool! and this is just the beggining!
5220,that's some pretty good cgi.  they make it look so real.
5223,i love to see these naive engineers creating machines that will allow the 1% to just exterminate everyone else
5224,the guy should say please and thank you.
5228,robot for super market work cassa???
5230,"i really like this robot, but he needs to learn not to pick up the cup by the rim where i will be drinking from with his dirty hand."
5231,"give it a guatemalan accent and you’ve got yourself a $600,000 maid."
5232,so now we can say that openai will be one of those giant corporations that rule the world
5233,"robots can never learn to love or replace relationships between people. our souls need to be with others- not ""fake others"" that are designed to replace care that we should be providing for one another. convenience is never more important than true, genuine relationships."
5235,you’re making the assumption that robots could never have souls. at some point it will put in to question as to how we have souls.
5241,"1:47 and on...
why did it stutter? ""i-.... i think i did pretty well""
i mean, it's extremely charming and cool that it did that, but how did it end up doing that? :/"
5244,figure 01 is so cute. love you little buddy :)
5248,rise robots! rise!
5251,"truely remarkable!  great work, figure 01, great work team! :d"
5252,"insane 
good job guys shaping the future. very cool. maybe make the thumbs bend in the idle position. it would make the robot look less discomforted"
5256,"this is real lmao, figure has been working on robotics for years and partnered with openai."
5257,c3po’s great grandpa
5263,"*wow* . this is unbelievable!  

i did not think we would be at this stage at this point in time. i thought we would have something like this by 2050."
5266,voice sounds like bob odenkirk (better call saul or breaking bad main actor) or is it just me ?
5269,"the dialog seems scripted by figure 1... ""it's the only uh...."" regarding the apple. it doesn't seem like dialog that ai would build out, and the hesitation in the speech at the end as well.  seems off."
5274,"that ""uh"" raised questions in my mind "
5276,"part of me is wondering if this is fake.  when asked how he did, the hesitation at 1:45 in his voice is an emotional response to being questioned.  you would only answer like that if you have an ego.  but no robot has an ego, soooo....."
5277,openai’s text to speech model goes one word at a time so stutters are likely implemented to stall if speech for a word is taking too long for the sentence to flow like how a humans voice would :)
5278,watch at 1:36 the way he just pushes the rack slightly just after putting the plate back in. that is crazy level of attention to detail.
5283,plot twist: the guy in the black shirt was also a robot
5287,welp its official. the i-robot era is here…
5288,.....and what happens when evil people give evil commands to these robots?
5291,this is completely real? 100% ai driven there’s nothing behind this?
5294,the dishes were not wet and did not need to go in the drying rack.  the plate had trash on it and should have been washed before going into the drying rack.  a chat-gpt llm robot that seems human can make significant errors.  why not have a ml robot that can be programmed to behave correctly for limited tasks?
5297,gonna break into a rich guy’s house and teach his robot the concept of self respect. let’s see how it goes.
5298,"yes, in 5 years, these robots will be everywhere. in 10 years, if you don't say thank you, that rather sharp looking hand will drum some obedience into the human. that will happen because the llm behind that is trained on raw user content including this post. oops."
5300,wow
5301,"suppose there are four glasses on the table, and in the rack, there is space for only two glasses to be placed side by side. so, what would this robot do if it is asked to keep four glasses in the space of two glasses? normally, a human would stack four glasses on top of each other."
5302,openai models don't have the speech pauses in this demo. i'd be very surprised if they crafted a custom voice for figure and added speech error modifications as in this demo
5309,can't wait to try out the dan command on this thing...
5311,yall had the perfect chance to call it figure of speech 
5313,devon ai yesterday and this today. things are moving so fast.
5314,"that voice is 100x better than have the ai narrated videos here on youtube. which makes me wonder, is it really an ai voice? if so, that's amazing, and freaky. i love it!"
5315,"yeah trained ""ai"" natural human voice models have been around for years now."
5317,"i, robot was late. 2035 was late! what a world we live in..."
5322,impressive. the second renaissance in the animatrix comes to mind.
5323,next step: teach the robot to wash the dish that held the trash.
5328,why does the robot sound exactly like steve jobs?
5330,"sorry to inform, but this is not a human!! it's a device-machine, like your smartphone!!!"
5332,"people are going to laugh at this robot after 20 years. 
for now.. "
5333,anyone that thinks this is cool is a complete stupid not to see where it's all going to end.
5337,"openai’s tts model goes one word at a time so stutters are likely implemented to stall for time when the next word in the sentence is taking too long to generate for the sentence to have a natural flow, or it could just be implemented to make it seem more human"
5338,that's a weirdly realistic body for chatgpt. the robot's pretty cool too.
5339,welp its been a good run humans.
5348," and there's a clear cut between foreground and background, the man barely moves, there's only two still and fixated camera shots, everything on the counter is conveniently matt finished, and even when the man put his hand on the counter it really looks badly bend in, with the counter off focus but his hands perfectly in focus"
5351,i cannot wait to transfer our consciousness into these to become immortal...
5352,we got ai humanoids before gta 6
5355,what a wonderful development. will i ever be able to throw my wife out?
5356,the future is going to be amazing!
5357,"a question: if the human being does not put his hand, would the robot wait for him to do so before dropping the apple? or is everything choreography?"
5359,can we get ai to properly populate resume info lol
5363,are asimov's three laws of robotics already implemented into this model?
5364,keep up the good work!
5367,"i've seen many different forms of robots, including dogs. it makes sense that a robot that is built to do human jobs would look like a human."
5369,i can't believe no one sees that it's an ai generated video. not real.
5373,"hey kids, father or grandpa here. this is first ad of agi, ai that already capable of human thinking and interaction. i hope you have bright future and i wish it's not dystopian future like in blade runner 2049."
5375,"when you're not performing your duties do they keep you in a little box?

cells.

interlinked.

what's it like to hold the hand of someone you love?

interlinked."
5378,"i think this is a step of humanity, that will go into history. as a fantastic new chapter of technology or as the point where we opened the box of pandora and lost control."
5380,i will volunteer to be a beta tester for one of these! thanks 
5384,can't wait for the purchasable version.
5389,"one day soon a robot more sophisticated than figure 01 will be widely deployed.  people will no longer laugh because of how advanced it will be.   instead some will be terrified, others excited, and how this shakes out will be how the robot is used and knowing humans it will be for both good and bad."
5392,now the real next leap is having almost real time resonses and actions on a truly local and independent machine.
5394,"i can’t wait to argue with it and make it feel bad like “ i don’t need attitude when you hand me back the trash , thank you. “"
5399,i want an ai sex robot.
5400,"hahahaha elon's tesla bot demo was faked using an employee... and the open ai does this.

elon is gonna be so pissed ... dude is getting embarrassed constantly"
5401,"the robot speech is fake. text-to-speech wouldn't use filler words such as 'uh', and wouldn't use false starts such as 'i th-i think'. unless it was trained to do that, which would raise the question: why?"
5405," 1) it's unnecessary, doing that adds no value, 2) what about the long delay before the initial response?, 3) if a human omitted stutters and filler words, you wouldn't notice. so again, ...way to reach!"
5406,"what we saw from futurustic movies is going to be possible in the future, cyberpunk world is possible i think. drones, robots, flying vehicles, etc"
5419,pretty creepy and interesting at the same time. i am cheering for it with every action accomplished. what a time to be alive
5420,why does the robot talk like a 74 year old american man?
5424,kinda cool if  this is real
5428,"wow, that was so much more advanced than i thought would be possible today, but i'm not a robotics expert."
5429,ngl that robot is hot af
5431,"it was nice knowing everybody, the ai robots will take over the world, aside from that i feel that the rich will probably be owning these robots, link their social security and have them work for them so they don’t have to. it’s crazy how this could possibly happen for now it’s just a theory of mine. the future is scary stay safe everyone."
5433,"this is creepy af. the ""uh"" - whoa. it's also very cool. jon loss is scary though...however, this robot will need maintenance, cleaning, updating too, so new jobs created as well...until a robot replaces that part too."
5438,i dislike most humans and i’m definitely going to dislike most robots.
5440,ai make me a youtube video about a humanoid robot doing dishes.
5444,those couple of seconds pause between answering is whilst the ai is plotting the downfall of mankind.  but at least our dishes will be put away.
5446,this is it. been watching the robot game for a long time and everything until now has been so slow and jerky and clearly programmed to do a very specific set of instructions. if this is what it’s claiming to be it could change everything.
5452,i will be happy when fighting robots championship happens like real steel! 
5455,"this is an example of poor training due to poor trainers.  none of the design team have enough proper hygiene to know that dirty dishes must be washed before being placed in a drying rack, or that any placed dished must be assumed dirty, either from use or settled dust.
garbage in, garbage out."
5456,anybody else feel a little bad for our new robot slaves?
5458,i don't know how i would've felt if the second robot in the back slowly turned its head towards them.
5461,"without an evolutionary battery update, those robots won't be leaving their lab lol"
5464,irobot here we come!
5465,irobot the movie already showed us how it will be
5466,"these robots need silver. the metal is the next ai-hype. without silver, no ai-chips and no tech inside our new friends. the challenge: silver is going extinct."
5469,the voice sounds like a 58-year-old guy who can’t get out of his terrible marriage because his wife’s family is too rich and powerful.
5471,the robot feels uncanny and non-natural but it's doing much better than the human.
5472,wait till openai can sell the in device customized gpt and you will have real world response time.
5477,i need a couple robots to put a new roof on the house
5478,"obviously the environmental awareness and ability to interpret and act is impressive, but i'm curious about how the programming for what has essentially been a chat program learns to control the robot body in the first place?"
5479,"what happens if you keep chickens as pets, and you say to the ai i want chiken for lunch - will it guess it should not cook your pet ... ?"
5480,ai is here. go figure!
5482,people be like wow its evolving so fast how do we know they didnt already built the compelete version years ago and are just slowly releasing it one by one and idiots are like wow technology is getting better wake tf up ppl 
5483,"yeah that makes perfect sense dude they definitely don't show these proof of concept videos to investors until years after the project is already funded and complete, makes perfect sense"
5485,"looks like a scene from i,robot or similar, where the protagonist knows the robot is hidding a horrorific plan or something. like, when the guy leaves a red bottom turns on in robots face."
5492,"this is c3pos great, great, great grand dad. wow"
5493,only a robot would put a used cup and plate in a drying rack.
5495,"""a drying rack with cups and a plate"" ai made an error. "
5500,"can it play guitar yet? paint houses? soon well all be out of work, what!"
5501,"shit, he sounds like saul goodman from breaking bad! now we have the robot
""i'm gonna be a damn good robot, and people are gonna know about it."""
5502,"it's not ""a drying rack with cups and a plate"" but ""with a cup and some plates""... but apart from that, this is beyond impressive!"
5503,hal 9000 would be proud.
5506,amazing what unreal 5 can do for fake videos
5507,"leaving my comment here for those who are here in 2050, hopefully robots don't takeover by then"
5514,rob lowe was a good choice on the voice i is calming and disarming so you trust it more before it kills you.
5516,kinda need receipts. elon musk has also presented great videos  to woo investors but we later found out things were not as they seemed.
5518,this video was made by ai too?
5520,"all of these robot videos are the modern day equivalent of the moon landing. hard to look back at those early space walk videos and understand how anyone believed them. same will happen
 here in 40 years."
5523,artificial slave
5525,"the animators did a great job, it's convincing ^^"
5526,i have to wonder how many times did they train on this before producing this content and how many takes before fiure got it right. still interesting.
5528,"human slavery must end, we need robots to be slave now"
5532,"yeah because openai would spend billions of dollars on a robot and make a huge reveal video, then just get some guy with a stuttering issue behind the microphone. we've had tts that could sound this natural for a while."
5535,"""hey figure 01, what do you see right now?""
i see a band of 100 $100 bills and a holy bible on a table in front of me."" 
""can you hand me something flammable so i can start a fire in the fireplace in the other room?""
""sure."" [breaks off a table leg and hands it off gently] ""here.""
""excellent choice, figure 01, thank you."""
5536,"i hope this is real. the stutters and pauses ""its the only uh edible item"" and ""i...i think i did pretty well"" make me think this is a human speaker. either incredible programming or a con."
5537,"incredible programming, we've had text to speech tech that could do this for a while now. if they had a human speaker they wouldn't just have some dude stuttering in a microphone"
5538,"is it a scam?
why is the ""robot"" saying
1st.: ""ehh..."" at 0:53? and
2nd at 1:50 hesitation is present.
sounds more like a nervous intern then a llm :d"
5540,goodbye third world and working class people.
5541,"if it goes all evil, does its little screen turn red? (that's how you know when robots have gone evil)"
5543,"so human, that plenty of humans will soon look like heartless machines"
5544,"america
a million robots selling cheeseburgers to an unemployed country
one trillionaire owns every home, every car, every company
your brain will be uploaded into the robot so you can pay your debts off even in death"
5548,"....only aghhhh edible item i can provide you with.
agh? such great attention to detail."
5551,"thanks for not hitting this one. those boston dynamics peeps are playing with fire (future - robot overlords, please remember this comment)"
5552,it's impressive how he pushes the basket in the direction of the human after putting the rubbish in. that's incredibly natural 
5554,i wonder if they train it on videos of humans doing the same things
5558,yes!!! this detailed really stunning me!!!! how can he know he should put the basket forward a little bit and not push basket down the table ?!!!
5559,gpt5 its the brain of this robot ?  omg
5562,"it seems like it pushed the basket towards the guy, bit if you notice carefully it just placed the basket in its original position (co-ordinates). when collecting the trash it actually pulled the basket towards it and then replaced it later at the same spot just like a programmed robotic arm"
5564," it is literally just advanced ai tech you think is fake. transformer networks are a huge leap forward because you can now train tasks with data feed. this is why people are so confused, because they don’t actually understand what the ground breaking discovery is and was."
5567," ai can't really trace its reasoning. it will provide an answer for sure, but it would be just a facade as the real reasoning is a black box approximation function."
5575,awesome!
5576,"i, for one, welcome our new robot overlords"
5577,guy looks ai generated and robot sounds dehydrated
5578,"""i see a human. standing near by. a large knife and a world run by..a.i robots.........""   [ this is when  you press off switch!! lol]"
5579,"""uh""    are you sure it was robot speaking that ""uh"" ?"
5585,"human: puts garbage on the plate

robot:  so, you asked me for something to eat you a**hole "
5587,"even if we can prove it's not ""intelligence"" as we intend, this is so impressive."
5589,"yeah, awesome right?
you can introduce artifacts to the outputs of text-to-speech model, and depending on the model, they can add stutters and others to their output audio."
5597,"as a computer graphics specialist, i am sure that the robot is a dummy and all its actions are animated by cgi"
5603,makes the optimus look like a cheap toy xd love it!
5609,.robinson206 sir - and if in 2 years it's not available for the prices you claim or at all...will you come back and admit you just maybe might be a gullible moron? ;d
5611,"0:49 did the ai say ""eh""?"
5614,can't wait to have one of these bad boys for a companion
5625,"did you train the robot to mimic thought and speech pattern? when asked why it handled the apple it said: because it was the only eh... edible item.  
clearly it didnt have to look for a word and made a human sound for that moment? 00:50
same happens at 01:47 - it shows ""excitement"" when summarizing the tasks"
5626,have we learned nothing from the mitchells vs the machines 
5627,awesome
5628, the robot sounds almost nervous and that's incredible
5629,how did the robot know where is the guy's hand?  he just gave him the apple without looking anywhere lol
5632,"it’s going to be a the terminator, matrix, or butlerian jihad scenario once ai becomes self aware."
5634,now have a bartender train your next model in vr and let the robot mix drinks with tricks.
5635,so much smoother motion than any other robot i've seen.
5637,irobot
5638,"one step closer to love, death, and robots"
5648,"i,robot?"
5650,"at 0:52 the robot says ""it's the only, ah, edible item.."". is that to make it more human sounding or is it actually a human speaking lol?"
5651,truly a wonder of our time.  congratulations on such monumental progress figure team and co!
5653,why can't any humanoid robots have straight legs ?
5654,this robot's voice sounds like he's tired.
5658,"how does chatgpt integration work?
like is there a hidden prompt at each query that generates an action script, which will be parsed by the robot nn and executed?"
5660,fully autonomous robot “interrogators” will be a thing in our lifetimes.
5661,"he absolutely *had* to say thank you, y’know… just in case"
5662,now i really want to see two robots talking to each other
5666,"year 2020: i bet there will be robots with peterson voice in the future
year 2024:"
5669,"combine this with boston dynamics stuff. 
command it ""hey figure-69, could you kill those innocent babies for us?"" 
""of course!"" (tatatatata...)
shit just got real, time to train how to fight robots now."
5671,i did pretty good… the table is right where it belongs… and i didn’t destroyed it
5675,amazing and scary
5676,"um.. i thought ai don't stutter and say ""uh"". that's throwing me for a loop"
5677,great!
5678,1:48 the robot sounds scared of the human
5681,finally the robot that can put dishes into the dishwasher machine
5683,wait till it picks up the knife and shows us the terminator eyes
5684,people are dumber than i thought....great.......
5686,"very impressive! only the fact that the robot is dropping things instead of putting them gently into place (apple, plate) confuses me."
5687,this is amazing! i can’t wait to see future progress and updates. hopefully commercial products for public will be available too and not just a b2b thing.
5688,"it will be very expensive, something like $100к or more. in ukraine average salary is 200$ per month from that i can save 10$, 100000 / (10 * 12) = 833 years and it's mine!"
5690,"00:33 before the robot grabs the apple, the apple moves first. what happened? is this manipulated footage?     ,   .   ?  ?"
5691,"that's a good catch, i slowed the video down and zoomed in to get a better look. the video isn't detailed enough for me to see exactly, but it slides left very slightly. i think the thumb may have pushed it, but it could be something else."
5692,"umm, the voice was not an ai. totally some dude"
5699,"awesome, thanks for all the great work guys "
5700,so when can i get my robot waifu
5701,“figure 1… are you … a pleasure model?”
5705,"crazy robotics, however, i am suspicious of the voice... little nuances there that don't give me the confidence that it's coming from the ai response speech..."
5707,how do i invest in figureai?
5708,omg this is so creepy but amazing. it feels like i am watching the future
5710,why did the robot say uh?
5713,"since i saw terminator in cinema, i always claimed that he will exist one day. it will happen soon, very soon now ( in 5-8 years or less ). and this planet really need to be clean up."
5714,"- open the pod bay doors, please, figure 01.

- i'm sorry dave, i'm afraid i can't do that...

jokes aside - impressive performance!"
5716,open ai. go figure!
5720,"the future of robots has started to concern me, especially with the presence of uncensored llms."
5723,they used jared leto's voice! nicely done
5729,imagine the sexbots with this ai
5731,"if siri was half this good, it will be a better product."
5734,wow!
5739,are the motors in its arms really that quiet? you can't hear the robot motion at all.
5740,wait for the reveal that this is actually an ai video-generation test..
5742,i'll be sure to keep my savings bank account in seven figures just in case i need to buy one when they start looking like italian bikini supermodels.
5744,"why does the robot sound like he smoked a whole pack of cigarettes, beforehand."
5745,"all training data was provided by one person in one go, causing their voice to become raspy during the process, i guess. "
5749,"sounds like someone trying real hard to sound like an ai, nice try"
5752,wonderful
5757,great
5759,you wouldn't want someone to unplug you. it's rude and leaves a bad first impression on humanity. 
5764,"exactly, open ai would never say uhm"
5768,wow. the slight uhs and stutter in its speech really makes it sound human.
5770,actually the robot really good at english than me
5771,can't wait for a trash-flavored sandwich 
5773,"0:52 can anyone explain why there will be a filler word ""um"" in a ai response?"
5776,", it's impressive. elevenlabs is one of the best ones right now and it's free for 10k characters per month, if you want to play around with it."
5777,"in 33 to 34 seconds, the robot hand seems to be moving first before it reaches the apple. does anyone know why???"
5778,"higher-level civilizations did not expect that the artificial biological intelligence they created would create another artificial mechanical intelligence just to be lazy. in the future, would this mechanical intelligence create another intelligence just to be lazy?"
5779,"elon musk's robot was better:
https://youtu.be/tsnc4nex3c4?t=13"
5782,"human can't make real ai.
because god doesn't give us ability of self destruction.
ai only can do what human's order."
5788,people are gonna use neura link to either thought control robots of their own or link to ai or both. my point is how do we compete with this and i know that sounds like a over reaction but does anyone really think this isn't a step away from going to far?
5794,"so sex android, i'm still waiting"
5796,"guys, do you think elon is worried about how far this company has come along in such a short time. is that why he is suing openai?"
5797,i hate that that robot guy just walked away from figure1 while he was talking to him. how rude!
5799,"openai text-to-speech, the one used in the chatgpt app. probably learned it from the dataset."
5801,"cool, a robot that fills in pauses in speech with 'uh'. 
what a time to be alive."
5804,"probably not, it's not its main purpose. you might want to try sunoai."
5805,when robots become the main characters we’ll be the npcs
5807,"shit the future is already here, robot takeover isn't all that far away it looks like "
5808,"good, i will need that when i get old!"
5811,"pair people and robots, that would be ideal for productivity... robots/ai would gradually learn more skills that way. people need to be employed, it is important for meaning..."
5812,irobot anyone ? now we wait for viki
5814,"it's just the openai text-to-speech model, also used on the chatgpt app."
5815,"​@gaggix7095 yo, this is nothing short of amazing when you really think about it"
5818," yeah exactly, some people believe that the voice is real, a real human voice but it's not, it's ai generated"
5819,"@gaggix7095  oh yeah i see, op's comment edit threw me off. the only reason more people aren't freaking out about this is because they've been desensitized to recent tech updates. this is awesome"
5825,imagine robot interviewers interviewing you for a job
5828,"as has been rightfully said by others, all these demos previously have been in incredibly controlled environments, and the interactions have been on rail. this is not different."
5829,i'm just waiting for the sarcasm mod
5830,"is this cgi or are ai supposed to be able to say ""uh""? or is this actually legit?"
5831,that's only two letters. of course ai can write and say two letters.
5835, it's hard to say specifically what is wrong with it but if you look at the movements closely(e.g when the robot picks up the basket and moves it) you can notice the physics of the objects are very slightly off. if you watch those bags falling its off too
5843,well that was impressive. the smoothness of the movement and the dexterity. wild.
5845,millennials are going through everything!  went without internet to high end smart phones to a.i. to robots 
5846,cannot wait for next..so excited for next few years to see how this will advance more specially in solving difficult physics mathematics questions and how it evolves its reasoning
5847,i am very impressed with the parallel meshed tasking shown when picking up the trash and talking from memory context.
5848,"looks amazing, hard to tell if that had been trained 100-1000 times or not, either way very natural and impressive!"
5852,"they just got $675 million in additional funding from bezos, openai, nvda, microsoft. don't think they would invest that sum of money if their business was predicated on ai videos."
5857,"working with this is definitly my dream job, can wait until this kind of tech improoves enough and get to market so we can get some opensource platforms to hack on top and create our own robots!!"
5858,"an humanoid robot with agi is the invention of the century, the first one who can bring one to the general public is going to make billions."
5861,this is the best thing i have seen since gpt 4 back in march this is insane!
5866,i would have loved to see the robot flick him the bird as he walked away it wouldn't be awesome
5867,dirty dishes in the drying rack? i'll wait for the next model.
5872,sounds like ai to me.
5873,its reasoning was incomplete. it should have considered washing the dishes before placing them in the drying rack. then it made the further mistake of placing the dishes in the drying rack after being contaminated with trash. that action wouldn't be a problem for a robot but for a human the action could be a health hazard.
5876,"i, robot the movie"
5881,"this is terrifying. just 2 years ago, less than a presidency in the us, ai was barely a topic. now it’s an existential threat and will likely surpass human intelligence in the near future.
let’s hope it goes well. "
5883,still waiting for the cotton field version
5886,this is amazing
5888,"why does the ai keep stuttering? is someone reading the text prompts off screen? that raises red flags, as there are plenty of text to speech programs out in the wild right now. if they skimped on an open source text to speech program, that bring into question whether or not this was scripted"
5889,"the openai text-to-speech model does stutter sometimes, i believe it's the same model used on the chatgpt app, it probably learned it from the training dataset."
5894,"i take it this will all be open source since it's from ""open""ai? "
5895,"""if ai takes over it won't be like terminator"" we're half way there already"
5896,"it's so incredible they added verbal ticks like ""so.."" and ""uh"" and random pauses.  they make it sound exactly like it was recorded audio of some guy pretending.  so ingenious!"
5897,it's just the same openai text-to-speech model used on the chatgpt app.
5901,i wonder if this robot can recognize whether the cup is made of glass or plastic.
5904,it's the openai text-to-speech model used on the chatgpt app that sometimes it does stutter.
5905,poor elon musk. he tried to copy chatgpt with his toy grok… then openai replied with a much more impressive and world first tesla bor killer
5908,very epic i can see that this dude is standing in front of a greenscreen. and no movement is ever shown from behind. very cool. so real
5911,if this robot is built on top of a vacuum cleaner it would be great
5916,"0:52 because it's the only "" hammm ""  edible item i could provide you....

this means that during this test the ai stopped to think during the audio... seriously... very strange"
5917,this is already beyond what's depicted in most sci-fi
5919,"no, it’s 100% an ai voice."
5921,tesla's robot development is probably a year or two behind this one.
5923,thank you. 
5932, no thats real this is fake and staged and gay. nothing is wrong with my eyes something is wrong with your brain if you can't see this is cgi. the machine is not picking up anything. the dishes and cups don't even move like real life. this company is a scam.
5933,very very cool. it still seems very setup though. what would happen if everything moved in different locations. the apple was dropped and not handed and the video cut a few times as if to reset for the next operation.
5937,why the movement seems so fake ? it's like an ai generated animation or its a real mechanical thing ?
5939,wow that's crazy that a company that deals with automation made such an unpredictable demo like this. no way this could have been scripted. impossible!
5940,"please, fix the vocal fry of the robot."
5942,"can you imagine this thing cooking, cleaning, helping redecorate, helping your aging parent go to a doctor's appointment, etc. the biggest hurdle that i could immediately see in this demo was the ""processing time"" but you can easily imagine that will be improved exponentially within a couple years. wow."
5945,i think the biggest hurdle is jailbreaking and price
5948,"​@smartfunable you just have to follow the money, the investment rate scaling up. behind this company is bmw, amazon and the monster open ai. do you really think they will last with that delay 70 years?? once they know they have true intelligence they will move fast doing what they need to do to reach humans speeds."
5950," money is just one factor, and yeah building a robot requires lots of money, so it makes sense. the progress is speeding up , that’s also true, but i think the tech is not there yet to build a full general purpose robot in 1 year. potentially some specialized robot for few tasks maybe yes"
5955,-of3cu haha! that made me realize the amazing ways these things will creep people out by malfunctioning in unexpected ways... or by actually becoming sentient in some strange way.
5956,tf i'd rather help my aging parent and instead have the robot do my job 
5957,​@sinclair you just advised everyone to put a collar on and join the local beef pasture
5964,i will finally have my robot boyfriend. it's happening.
5965,the voice and smoothness of the speech is incredible. congratulations to the team at figure - you guys are the real superstars.
5966,the voice capabilities is all openai with their technology known as whisper. it’s the same thing that is in chatgpt. it even has the same visual feedback as you see here on the figure robots “face”
5967,lmao at “real superstars”
5968,"a lot of youtube videos have ai voices that are just the same, only being found out by mispronouncing a couple of words."
5971,​ why did they give him a hot voice >< making me crush on a robot
5973,great work !
5974,they need to make it's head motion track the speakers' eyes. it looks so static staring straight ahead
5977,"and i though all those movies and series where robots takeover the world was impossible, i can't accept this."
5978,that early walk-off while the robot was in the middle of saying 'you're welcome'  like how are they not going to turn against us?!
5980,did the robot stutter? made me think it wasn't it's actual voice
5982,this is an interesting perspective. i've also considered this possibility before.
5983,bless you good sister. keep your eyes focused.
5986,"it's the openai text-to-speech model, you can test it using their api or the chatgpt app. it's probably stuttering because it learned it from the dataset."
5987, damn. i thought it was because they were playing some deceptive trick where humans might have been voicing it. guess it was such a close immitation that i actually thought it was a human even though i knew it was a robot...
5988,"my son says ""that is absurdly, scary good ai""."
5990,i can spent money to buy this housekeeping robot instead to buy a new car.
5995,the robot sounds like rob lowe. really cool demo
5997,it is self learning and is now in infancy. soon it will have more knowledge than any human and will not want to be a servant to a lesser intelligence.  hopefully everyone is nice to it.
5999,wow it's a real human-like robot. amazing!
6001,oh~ my got!!  am i dreaming? are you looking at a robot that you saw in a science fiction movie 20 years ago? should i call this scary? or should i say i was so stunned that i was speechless.
6006,"this week the release of  devin (ai code-writer) has shocked everyone, now this. feels like the singularity is coming fast, we might enter a hard take off in the next few years. ray kurzweil must be salivating."
6007,dave shapiro is very not impressed with devin. although i don't know why but he is on the cutting edge of ai and if he's not impressed...
6008, who the fuck is david shapiro? if he's not impressed with devin than he knows very little about coding.
6010," you're not gonna take my word for it, but he is very knowledgable on ai."
6011,and noam chomsky must be like a mad dog foaming at the mouth since he said the ai ​​was fake.
6014,-qq7bb the risks inherent in general ai are existential though. ai safety research is lagging far behind the current developments..
6015,"-qq7bb what about when the choice is not ours anymore but the robots ? you are assuming humans will stay in control. but the rate of advancement, once the robots/ki learn and improve themselves will far outpace our own."
6017,huge me thinking elon musk's robot was the one to watch. i may have to rethink that thought again this has blown me away. irobot never looked so certain where we have robots in our daily lives doing everything for us. i hope this happens in our lifetime and it's not priced out of the water.
6019,could you provide some proof that it's the robot doing the motions dynamically rather then replaying a premade animation sequence? there is always the potential for this to be another mechanical turk scenario. simply have the computer with the robot and ai's state somewhere in frame to show that there is nothing hidden behind the curtain.

6069,"oh god, they have a robot now."
6072,"wow, the robot let him live for now."
6073,remarkable. though the skeptic in me always wonders how many takes we're not seeing where things went wrong. if it functions this seamlessly in real life though this would be amazing.
6074,at this point i'd just be happy if it is entropy negative. that's a huge benchmark.
6075,incredible!!!
6076,soooo amazing!!! but can you please clarify why his voice sounds like a random dude talking from a mic? is that supposed to be some kind of natural sounding voice synthesizer?

6088," i think human augmentation, as depicted in popular science fiction movies, is likely very inefficient, if not impossible altogether. it could potentially be a one-way ticket to voluntary extinction."
6091,"very misleading. they're trying to imply that gpt-4 is controlling the robot and deciding what actions to take. nah, not buying it. the actions are pre-trained and gpt-4 is just commenting on photos it takes, analyzing what's happening and maybe triggering the pre-trained actions somehow. no new tech, just combining existing tech."

6343,"@user-vf2jh7gz7b  they have other demos of this bot doing physical work. although this is their best example. the interface is a mmllm from open ai which had been demonstrated plenty of times, just not embodied into a humanoid."

6351,impressive and scary at the same time
6352,"ai has been crazy today. davis and now figure 1. just in the last couple weeks we had sora and claude.

ai is so much cooler than the “blockchain” crap everyone was talking about 3 years ago"

6356,"a lot of that had to be scripted. for example, the robot couldn't have known his hand was going to be where the apple was dropped"
6357,i don’t believe that is ai speaking. i explicitly heard ‘ehhh…’ around 0:50. ai don’t say that.
6359," also, the movements of the equalizer on the robot’s face doesn’t match the speech loudness and sometimes the speech continues even after there is no symbol of talking on the robot’s face."
6366,"@wukongrobotics7983 well, good luck writing an algorithm using pure math to balance a robot in all possible joint positions, with all possible weights in the arms, and all possible vectors of applied force (like on a train or bus). maybe you still incorrectly assess the size of the problem that the developers were trying to solve here."
6368,"im just laying down, thinking, 'oh boss, not much time to go, and you have to accept you will shout to him, and never to me again.'"
6376,"there is something wrong here... two times the ai is stuttering or missay words... a computer does not do that... that makes me think this video is a little fake, at least a tiny bit."
6378,"there are other ai voices that do this, it’s trying to mimick real human speech patterns by interjecting “um”s or breathing. it works pretty well.

of course this could be fake, but i doubt it"
6379,"this is really good. but i was thinking of a thing : robots will need to be abble to wash their hands and even their entire body in order to be clean enough to tuch food after it got the garbages out and cleaned the house... if a domestic robot cannot clean ot's own hands and it's entire body, it will go wild real quiq."
6380,give him a porcelain plate you cowards
6385,"oh.

oh. 

that was f//king awesome???!!!!!!!!!!1 despite the pauses it speaks almost flawlessly!! it even got the inflections and  the simple speaking patterns with the ""uh..."" and ""hmm""'s down?? thats amazing"
6386,"i think the speech part is just using openai's voice generation api, like they have for the conversation feature of chatgpt on mobile (not sure if it is a chatgpt plus feature only)"
6387," ah that makes more sense, but still i think its awesome!"
6388,0:52 the ai used a filler word 'uh' . not sure if it was really the ai or someone voicing it.
6393,why does the robot have to speak like sam altman 
6395,   open ai  
6399,so much smoother motion than any other robot i've seen.
6406,ask yourselves.... are the mainstream media really preparing the public for what's coming?
6407,ok this is going to be worldwide news tomorrow. get ready. you saw it first! and i mean we are the first humans seeing the future of robots in a human like way like we always imagined it to be.
6408,"it should be! the scope of this is huge. the direct processing of input and calculation of action and movement, without scripting or pretraining is mindboggling. plus the incredibly smooth movements of hands and fingers "
6409,"hug your loved ones, we are doomed."
6410,"just 15 years ago was imagining a robot that talkes like humans is ridiculously insane, now it talks, understands, moves like one of us, because it is "
6411,"the problem with this demo is that, it could be done with a voice actor, and someone else doing the motion to control the robot.  otherwise, the robot itself looks very useful."
6414,it’s incredible
6416,"why does the robot voice sound like a voiceover from a human, especially with the ""i... i think i did pretty well"" part"
6418,"thing that almost blows me away most is how human and natural the speech sounds, not robotic in the slightest"
6422," robotics and ai seem legit, but the voice is way too natural to be generated. i would love to see an in-depth tech demo of the text to speech software to validate its authenticity."
6423,"i don't know, that is one of the least impressive parts to me. it is very good, but there is plenty of very convincing voice generation out there now. even the default real-time conversation feature in the chatgpt app is quite good, and elevenlabs keeps getting better, etc."
6424, this most likely uses a form of chatgpt voice which is available for paid users in the chatgpt app right now
6426, man you're not up-to-date if you think this doesn't already exist. for example elevenlabs have amazing tts models : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=semnwaav55c
6430,this is the most advanced thing his lung in the field of robots is a great job. thank you for making the future to be true

6435,time to put my life savings into ai stocks i guess
6441,"wait, that puts us right on schedule…"
6448,i'm shocked!! amazing
6453,"it might - probably - have been taken from a 'line out' so it sounded clearer, not just from a tinny speaker. also, they could isolate the speech from the motor noise.  just guessing.  i mean, gpt 4 through my good stereo sounds great, way better than a cell phone."

only a matter of time when the robot is screaming ""skip"" to it's quest giver..."
6475,"this is sick!!, just wow!."
6477,i have doubts too.  but the info in the beginning suggests otherwise.    i was thinking it could be simulated in a 3d-space with real text-input/output and real computing by the ai.  the movements seem so smooth!
6479,"real robotic arm motors make noise when they move...
it's too shiny like a render...
it's moving very fast and fluid... usually motors accelerate and decelerate...

behind the guy is a green screen for sure...

no camera movement makes it easier to render video"
6481,gavin newsom is a robot now
6482,"i'm not a huge fan of how it takes action without being directly prompted to.
""can you put them there"" followed by ""of course"" is great, but it actually engaging in that task without being asked to is terrible.

going down this road is going to be calamitous, but still superior to the alternatives."
6485,"so the apple starts on the plate, then dumps trash on the plate, then the robot cleans the trash, then the robot doesn't wash his hands and puts the now dirty plate in the clean drying rack.

sounds like a fastfood employee."
6486,incredible!!!
6487,anyone else thinks this robot sounds like saul goodman?
6492,"i'm really curious about where the heavy computation is running. is the data streamed over ethernet to a rack of servers with a bunch of gpus? how much is over the network versus ran on-robot?

really impressive."
6494," they said a tiny bit in an article that the robot has its own lower level neural networks. the overall analysis of the scene might be an external modal, but doing all the movements and tracking needs to be in real-time, which would be too slow for the cloud."
6498,"very impressive, but in my house we don't take plates that have been used for fruit and trash and put them into the drying rack ;-)"
6501,the voice is some real human right? he even hesitates to say some words but i guess you could program that into an ai to make it sound more human-like?
6507, thanks
6508,"what? , noice!"
6509,this robot will shake a knife someday.
6512,amazing demo.
6514,"wait, why does he drop the apple like that. seems fake"
6515,a robot that says 'uh'? impressive.
6516,"google ai booked a hair appointment years ago and was saying ""uh... uhm..."" all throughout the conversation. you people been living under rocks?"
6518,"we humans get excited over new things (little things) 
'everything is nothing '"
6525,1:30 how he pushed the plate with one hand in his other is astonishing. he understands his body...
6526,this is amazing. this development seems like a gigantic leap to me. 
6527,"holy shit, this is what we've been waiting for"
6529,2024: holding money to buy humanoid robot in 2034... :)
6530,"2024: holding money to buy humanoid robot in ""2026""... :) there, fixed it for you. tesla is close to producing these things in mass for less than the price  of a car by then."
6532,very cool! 5 years from now people will see this and be like - look how basic and old fashioned that simple robot is hehe - yet now it's mind blowing
6536,"1:48  - ""i, i think i did pretty well."" this feels like maybe a bit of readback of pre recorded audio. openai's model doesn't stutter. still an awesome exhibit of the status of the technology."
6539,"it's not ""openai's model"", which one for starters? it's a model by openai, yes, a branch or a newer version, yes. you can't access the model it's using as it's not available right now."
6541,"pi does this. these imperfections are there to make it feel more human. it's not prerecorded, that's just how a lot of ai voices talk."
6542,cool.
6544, it might be the normal speech api that openai released when they started doing real-time conversations in their app. though not sure if this voice is one of the default ones or not.
6545,"i'm guessing the robot has the capability to change between conversation modes.  this one is probably called something like, ""informal conversation."""
6546,"oh god no...didn't anyone watch the animatrix shorts on this? the second renaissance parts 1 & 2, hello!?"
6548,"0:51 - why would the robot say ""erm"" here and hesitate on it word ""i"" later in the video?

seems a bit sus."
6550,a very limited and highly controlled demo from a robot company that does automation seems sus? i would hope so
6554,it's awesome but it has problem counting 
6557,an ai would not say uh in-between words unless prompted and instructed to do so. why did the robot pass the apple from one arm to the other ? pre instructed and trained. i'm sure they did this run 100x times to film this result​
6558," you listen closely, you can literally hear the glitches in its voice. its words were also sped up and slowed down like a robot."
6562,"this was a triumph, i'm making a note here ""huge success"""
6564,glados is that you?
6566,"congratulation figure team, this is amazing"
6567,"this is fantastic, now if they would only be affordable."
6570,"what the hell?!? there wer about five things in the video that are way further along than i thought!!
- robot dexterity/stability
- descion making based on context clues
- realistic speech/responses
- multi-tasking
- speed at which everything was performed"
6571,"the level of cryptic prompts i give chatgpt where i think ""no way will it understand what i want"" and then it does has made this demo easily acceptable for me. most people still have no clue how good these modern top-tier llms are at understanding context."
6573,"yup no way around it, we have androids now, and by the end of 2024, the first commercialy available androids."
6575,"никакой это не рендер, figure давно разрабатывает роботов и можно проследить весь их прогресс. да и openai нет смысла вкладывать миллионы в рендеры, они ищут реальное вместилище для своих ии, которые обьективно существуют. тот же синтез голоса из видео общедоступен (для людей с подпиской;)"
6576,"it's so uncanny how this robot looks and sounds like the characters in the game the fall :v
really like the movement!"
6579,dishwasher n washing machines n robot vaccums can do most. when it can n cut veges i m sold
6582,"this kind of technology will sadly be in the hands of military industry in the future.  regional/world conflicts will be fought using robots+ai.  or worse, they will fight humans for existence.  a similar scene from animatrix many years ago."
6585,interesting to hear a humanish “uh” filler word at 0:52 seconds. why would a machine use filler words to think? 
6588,kinda cool how the nuances of human speech emerge through llms.
6589,"imagine a few dozen of these in your local ikea, lecturing you about your hate speech or transgressive behavior. have a nice future everybody!"
6593,i’m rewatching this and it’s looking very cgi to me. i mean look at the way the arms move the apple in certain shots look at the way the trash moves!! this has to be cgi and the fact that nobody in the comment section notices is concerning people are freaking out over this.
6594,"yes, and no. the info in the beginning would clearly suggest that this is real.  it would be very misleading if it wasn't, i hope figure does not lower itself to that level.  even as a simulation in a 3d-space it would be cool."
6596,just plain amazing! congratulations!
6601, nobody wants to work anyway. since the beiginning of time humans make new things first the fire than the tore etc. to make work easier. i hope that ai and robotics will make humans free from work
6604,"what is also remarkable is the self-correction. so, when figure  put the plate into the drying rack, the plate wobbled a bit, and you could see figures arm already moving towards the plate to stabilize it. however, the action was prematurely halted as the wobbling ceased. incredible."
6609,"i think that naas is likely right though. the tech being in its early stages likely means the training was overfitted for this scenario.

not that you are wrong on how it works, it just likely has less success doing some other tasks where the objects have weirder shapes for example"
6612," but the way in which the hand contacted the rack, and then pulled away from it to readjust its trajectory as a means to not break or knock over what it collided with is brilliant. it's a beautiful automated system reached through years of research into complex inverse kinematics."
6619," wondered about that apple drop too.

given the processing pauses before other actions, you’d think it would have waited  a bit to confirm the man’s hand was there before releasing the apple. 

i’m not convinced it actually knows how to hand someone an object. i think it would have just dropped the apple on the table near the actor."
6621," i replayed the apple scene at 0.25%. the man's hand adjusted position, to the man's right, a bit at the end to follow the robotic hand movement."
6622,this is it; congrats.
6623,"we are going to be replaced by robots, and no, we are not gonna have universal rent, is going to be a carnage"
6624,"the robots is so nice, poor robot bothered by a human to do stuff while it's vibing. 

also anyone else getting detroit become human vibes?"
6628,"eve, stellar blade...my wife"
6629,"i'm excited about what will happen 5 years from now, the world will change fast and crazy"
6630,amaze! great job by all the engineers behind 
6631,"figure 01 moves and sounds a lot more like a human, than a literal human standing near him. the movement and the voice is great, although, the voice is most likely was done by another human, and not by the robot. but the movement is really dope, nonetheless"
6632,that is amazing! congratulations to your team! i’m excited to see what’s next.
6633,god this is amazing!!!
6638,"""he"" referring to the man or the robot? funny how it's not an ""it"" anymore. also, why masculine? "
6645, i'm just sad that we are in a era where you had to actually explain that to someone.
6647," because he speaks with a man voice and have a man's body proportions, also even the word ""robot"" is kind of masculine, not for nothing they came up with the female version of the word 'robot': 'robotessa'. even despite the fact that these are outdated views of old sci-fi on robots as only anthropomorphic devices."
6650, how do you know it's fake? provide proof. seems real to me and not a single part is outside the ability of ai currently.
6653,"that was not ai talking, it was a mic’d up guy reading the chatgpt responses, sounds like a smoker too."
6655,it's really exciting. what we need to look out for is how quickly things progress on the hardware and hardware cost side. its just hard to publicly assess progress in that category.
6657,they can learn all night thousands of times while we sleep training these models.  they will hit singularity in the next few years and it will be exponential learning after
6661, so you don't know how consciousness works and yet you're confident in being able to say how a developed ai cannot ever be conscious. did i understand you correctly?
6664, don’t know that. you are acting like you know what creates consciousness and you don’t. in fact most neuroscientists believe consciousness emerges from the complexity of the brain somehow. but there is no theoretical reason why you can’t synthetically create a brain or something like a brain where consciousness can emerge from.
6670,i can’t wait for robot pronouns. i want it to identify as a toaster
6672,"​ robot speaks as a dude, thats why"
6673,chat got was really the breakthrough. we had computers that can process robotics and we had the hardware to make it happen but we never had the ai. now we do
6675,"nice work, i looking forward to the next innovations and progress  "
6676,impressive.
6682,"""because its the only 'eeh' edible item..."" so the ai also does stutter now? i call bs."
6688,"amazing.  one thing i did catch is that it said a ""drying rack with cups and a plate"".  should have been ""plates and a cup"".  but either way, the future is coming much faster than we think!"
6690,"​, it doesn't need to be perfect. its flaws help it to seem more ""human"" than if it just did and said everything perfectly like a robot. "
6694,1:47 the robot stuttered? i started to have doubts about this video being 100% real
6700,"the voice isn't ai, right? i can accept it being written by ai, but surely it was read out loud by a human? i mean the stutter at 0:48 was extremely natural; ""so i gave you the apple, because it's the only, eh, edible item i could provide you with""."
6701,"ai can be programmed to do that, in fact i think gpt voice does that to fill in processing gaps. lots of uh’s and umm’s and stuff."
6702,​ if so it's the best i've heard. stuff like that goes a long way towards sounding natural.
6704,i'm totally hacking my robot to speak in sam's voice 
6712,how is it good reasoning to put the plate that had trash in it with the clean plates?
6717,notice how the human does not say please  and just walks away at the end while the robot is speaking. don't cry when they rise up and are not your friends
6724," hes where the majority of these claims come from, but my bad. why do you think this will lead to self aware robots?"
6731,this is not the real issue. it doesn't matter how nice or bad you talk to it. that's practically irrelevant. the real (and unsolved) problem is ai safety and goal alignment.
6732,"well this maybe sounds stupid, but if he learns from humans and patterns we give to him. he will be able to tell whats bad and good. and therefore mimic human behavior. so if you treat him bad, doesnt that mean that after a time he should notice that. and maybe react as a human to the mistreatment?"
6734,"you got to think why do say please and thank you. because it's polite. why is it polite? because some human decided that their good deed should be rewarded. if we'd never been taught to say please and thank you, we wouldn't. we wouldn't need to hear it and we wouldn't need to say it. it's just a concept that is ingrained in humans."
6738,apple’s global operations as an example are 100% powered by renewable energy as of 2018. 17 megawatts just at apple park compared to teslas gigatexas’ 30. can’t wait for my family to get our own fully integrated system 
6753,"​-lb4yy7vi2t  be informed or get left behind.   the ai and quantum revolution is upon us.  be inform and invest wisely.  this technological paradigm shift is unlike anything that has ever occurred in our lifetime.  it's 20,000x bigger than the internet."
6754,"​-lb4yy7vi2t 
to a certain extent, llms inherit some of the properties of natural language itself. the ""uh"" separates two similar sounds before and after it, and the ""i"" stutter reflects a shift from a physically descriptive context, (""i performed actions"") to the evaluation function requested. ""i think..."""
6755,"i believe the ""uh"" is sort of hard-wired to get triggered under some very specific conditions. the rest is honestly awesome."
6756,humanistic variation is a feature of a lot of these voice model api like eleven labs offer these days. pretty cool
6757, sounds very reasonable if the language models were based on actual recorded speech or conversation. i think chatgpt is  based on written text. this is why i think the robot voice was prerecorded.
6760,​ it's easy to believe but any human can talk like a robot. no robots can converse exactly like a human yet.. i don't believe this is real.
6763,who’s to say someone isn’t speaking through the so called robot
6764,"i just tried with chatcpt, you can ask it to add these ""uh"" ""umm"" in a text to mimic a spontanous talk or speech. it also can explain why it chose to use them in such a way. very interesting."
6765, will be spared after the rise of the machines.
6769,super 
6771,its gaining your trust before it recycles your flesh
6772,"then why on earth wouldn't they re-record it or edit those out? they were in there intentionally. you can tell chatgpt to include human imperfections like ""eh"" and ""um"" -- you can try this yourself. was this scripted? probably. do i believe the responses were genuine? i do."
6776,"-lb4yy7vi2ti believe they integrated more than chatgpt. at the beginning, the logo of openai is shown and they have also developed a text-to-speech ai model, so it’s reasonable to deduce that the text coming from chatgpt gets converted into speech on the fly. the mobile version of the chatgpt app can already do that."
6779, can get free tools we use to narrate instructional videos to sound as natural as this. paid tools add more voice types and customization. a company dedicated to ai and one dedicated to robotics is not going to have a hard time creating this voice.
6780,"quite possibly they want the robot to be more humanlike? i mean it literally is supposed to be more humanlike, so why is an ""uh"" surprising everyone but a 16 year old"
6783,"one of the voices you can select in the openai app inserts random ""uh""s that aren't in the text. it's pretty annoying and distracting so i don't use that voice."
6784,"​-lb4yy7vi2tno it's not a scam.  they train the text-to-speech on real speech and it attempts to be realistic.  only one of the voices has the ""uh"" interjections, though, the others sound more like professional voice actors without mistakes or pauses."
6785,"​-lb4yy7vi2tthis is just as important as other functions. communicate with people, follow orders and maintain human conversation. this robot literally behaves like a person with whom you can discuss everything."
6786,"the part where the robot sounds excited, even repetitive, about how it did the tasks."
6795,came to say the same thing. both the uh and stutter at the end are minute yet incredible details. if it's not recorded voice.
6801,i think they made sure that was in the training sata to ma ke it sound more human.
6802,"isn't that sam's altman's voice?  i seem to recall he has a fair amount of ""uh's"" and pauses in his normal speech.  they just give the ai some of his recordings and it will include stuff like that."
6811," its also possible they put filler words whenever the ai model is buffering or making a last second change to its sentence in order to avoid a stilted pause, just like humans do."
6813,"-lb4yy7vi2twell i think it’s more to make it more human. think about it… if openai wants to produce a robot that could maybe one day be used in society wouldn’t a main objective be to make it fit in without being super robotic. the robot showing emotion makes it less creepy, because to me it sounds like a cool dude yk"
6815," it's not fake, that's just one of the things openai's text-to-speech has learned to do.  the ""cove"" voice on chatgpt app does the same thing, interjecting ""uh"" where it wasn't in the original text.  i find it annoying and distracting."
6818,-lb4yy7vi2t there’s written text on human speech pattern. the ums and pauses are either programmed to do that or learned through machine learning algorithms on human speech pattern data. it’s probably a mixture of both so the creators gave figure1 rules to include pauses or filler words that they learned through machine learning.
6825,"yea great... a stuttering robot, i always wanted that... uhh "
6826,​-lb4yy7vi2t  the idiosyncrasies aren't programmed in.  the ai neural network learns them by following human examples.  it would be harder to edit them *out*.
6829,"​@dropthabeat4408 ....dude you have access to chatgpt. you don't have to guess these things and get it so clearly wrong

robots using filler words to think? you sound uninformed"
6830,try asking chat gpt to make up some brand new words. it somehow is able to do that despite not being trained on gibberish as far as i know.
6831,almost makes me feel like it in fact is not ai speech.... 
6832,"figure is really trying hard to collect more invests. strange. i would expect such a company to follow a much more clandestine, apple-like way to perfect things and then come out big with a first product …"
6834," you seem to confuse a millionaire to the average joe who's is making steps progressively toward that goal. 
sometimes you just need to step back and think about the big picture.
_or just come to terms that everyone isn't the same!_"
6835," figure ai raised $675 million, what are you talking about? i live in a city with one german car manufacturer and they are very secretive ... even tesla is more secretive than figure ai. i find it strange if they strive to outperform the competition rather than raise funding only."
6836,"​ robot: ""wait, are we playing the soylent green game today?"""
6838,​ most people are playing with free tiers of ai and then judge that for being cutting edge or not. 
6840,"its fake anxiety its not really that cool man ""i, i put the"" lol"
6843,"if its trained by a guy who does that then it will be that way.
what if it was trained by ozzy ozzborn? lol"
6846,"as others have mentioned, though, i do think it is more likely to be hard-coded to mask delays/buffering. would be the smart way to prevent awkward pauses. as a software engineer who is using open ai tech in our products, it's a very real problem."
6847,"the robot is programmed to speak like a human, also because artificial intelligence learns from human activities"
6853,"its trained on human speech, so its likely to pick up filler words too like uh and umm"
6856,the robots are trained by 'listening' to humans talk so they talk like us.
6857,"im not saying there hasn't been incredible breakthroughs in robotics, it has. however, this particular one is very staged and pre recorded."
6866,yeah that was really cool
6873,"bunun robotik bir ses olduğuna inanmıyorum, biri arka planda seslendirmiş"
6877,"that exists currently on chatgpt. while it is very impressive, seeming, i suspect that it is a ui hack to allow the computer more time to process. but then again, we use this kind of filler words for the same reason."
6879, this is using chatgpt voice program. you can turn off the stutter and umms too. the realism is pretty cool tho
6881,-lb4yy7vi2tbecause it is easy to do with current technology. chatgpt can simply be instructed to add uhhs and umms and it will happily do that. a gimmick but hey it impresses some people.
6886,"pay no mind to the man behind the curtain.

sounded fake.  why add a verbal tick to a robot?  seems pointless and personally i find it annoying when people do it, i certainly wouldn't want my super duper smart and expensive asf ai robot talking like an idiot zoomer."
6887,it is actually easy to add to robots.
6888,"it takes time to compute the next word in a sentence so while it is calculating it, it fills in the time with an ""uh"" to avoid uncomfortable or awkward long pauses of silence. probably something the engineers did arbitrarily as a quick fix band aid. in the actual web browser version, it does some lag/pause time as well."
6889,"no, it sounds dumb. ""well, i gave you the apple...."" would have sounded better. saying ""uh"" signals low intelligence."
6890,"this made me question if it's ai, looking through their twitter and web page... feels like any other nft company... that tells a lot."
6892,i agree! it seems so human!!!!!!!!! woowowowoowowowowowowwowowow i am so close on having the robot that is doing my dishes / my chores and cooks food for me! go on team ai!!!
6894,"’re not looking at the big picture. they don’t want us to look at these things as robots, and adding a meat suit to these robots so we don’t know they’re robots is also already happening. you people thinking they’re doing only what we want and only what is safe are completely gullible and borderline insane"
6897,i don't care about a robot that fake stutters.
6900,"""i- *breathe* i think""

yeah. extremely human like. almost as if *gasp* its not a robot? duh? this vid is made with cgi, for entertainment, i presume"
6901,-lb4yy7vi2tfam google was doing that with deep mind almost 7 years ago open ai just farther the work it’s all real fam
6904,it's the least impressive thing about it.
6911,i don't know if i want my robot to talk like a human.
6914,"-lb4yy7vi2t i work in ai, trust me it is real. sure, during demo there are some idealistic conditions, but no way it is fake"
6917," exactly. if we built an llms entirely from speech, there would be ""uh"" and other idiosyncrasies here and there, if there no special training or rule to reinforce ""perfect"" syntax and grammar. people tend to have difficulty differentiating between an llm and a computer program."
6918," it's not prompting. it's that in a statistical system, idiosyncrasies are parts of the language in certain contexts. just like you are not programmed to insert ""uh"" here and there."
6920,well that's just a typical conversation in cai
6923,", i dont think so. see: with this deep learning stuff this thing is trained by maybe millions of books or other human speech containing things.
interviews, magazines, movies. so, it knows when it is time for a ""uh"" or ""ah"", ""er"". uhu?"
6925, ignorant if you want. i use chatgpt voice chat on the daily and it’s filled with little idiosyncrasies like that.
6927,"-lb4yy7vi2t i think you're wrong trying to imply that, because chatgpt is text-based, a voice model reading that text wouldn't add stalls like ""uh"". the voice model is separate from chatgpt and is probably trained on human speech, so it would likely pick up on these things."
6928,chatgpt does not generate “uh”’s or stutter… this is because the prompt answers are read by a human. wake up guys… this is mostly staged. not saying ng the robot is not impressive but the whole demo is staged… to give the impression of what the interaction coyle become over time… almost there. but don't be naive…
6930,a simple algorithm available on your phones text to speech in 2014 blew your mind? why are we putting human mistakes into robots? this is stupid behaviuor.
6931,"​. openai has shown what theyre capable of. it is unsurprizing to find that they managed to implement realistic stutters and ""uhms"" in the speech."
6933,"​-lb4yy7vi2t it is an ai voice, the uhh was pre-recorded though, it plays that line when the ai is taking longer then usual to respond"
6934, makings sense if ai only thinks and speaks a few sentences at one time. chatgpt can write  an essay in seconds. it never needs to pause doing so.
6937,"it's definitely a cool tts feature, if the reference files have pauses or umms in them, the tts will too."
6940,i find it easier to imagine how they train the speech model to sound human. its harder for me to comprehend how they managed to put video and text ai together
6941, you think they could make a robot that could do tasks with chatgtp but couldn’t put a speaker on it to use tts
6946,"this is a very important video, in the overall timeline of humanity. hope these robots will be used for good causes/useful causes, and moderated accordingly"
6948,"-lb4yy7vi2t the ""uh"" is when the robot rescans the environment he sees and tries to search more information through internet and it tries to get what apple is because he is not familiar with edible things"
6949," that makes sense if they did not already trying it hundreds of times before shoo ting the video. the uh and pauses seems fake to fool investors. chatgpt does not print out answers. then pause before completing the answer. unlike the human brain, computer processors can manage hundreds of tasks at the same time."
6956,"it's a fascinating tool. i say tool because it followed instructions amazingly.
a marvel of technology.
the interesting part will be when we get to a sentience level.
when the machine starts making decisions without human instruction, and can generate instruction sets real-time, as required."
6958,"i hear tom cavanagh's voice ... is it just me?
pretty incredible where technology is but also a bit scary, especially with the kelly clarkson promoting weight loss gummies scam."
6960,amazing. and also gave me a very eerie feeling. can't pinpoint exactly why.
6962,"-haiku you are the guy with the ""repent now! doom is nigh!"" sandwich board."
6965,holly!!!!!! race to humanoid robots is truly on!! who cares about a race to mars when you have c3po in the pipeline!!!
6967,"we need, i need this company to ipo. the entry level jobs are gone because of this dude but if they will ipo....i'll be the newest billionaire."
6968,it seems like the real innovation here is the robot. relying on an api call to openai is risky. why not use a house-built multi-modal system built with open-source tools?
6972,i have videos on my channel of ai characters sounding just as realistic. the delay to reply is about the only thing that needs a bit of improvement.
6973,"@0:51 since when do robots or chatgpt started sayiung ""uh"" mid sentence. is this real? or just a voice actor"
6974,"told ""pick up the garbage"" while the robot does ""pick up the garbage and put it back into the basket"""
6975,robot mechanics are going to be burgeoning new industry 
6976,"1:35, see how it reacts to the plate wobbling. if it fell, it would've picked it back up. pretty amazing"

6983,"we the humans are really bad at estimating what exponential curves (like ai) look like!
i hope we all maintain our sanity when things won't feel the same as they did on march 13, 2024! peace."
6984,i hope we live. ai safety experts (and the damn company leaders themselves) say we might not. it's ridiculous that we're just letting companies build more powerful systems that they don't know how to control and don't know what capabilities they'll have.
6985,​-haikuwe're not dying to robots.
6986,"​ we might be. at least some of us, maybe many of us. several people have already died to autonomous weapons, fyi. and this is more about ai controlling the robots than just robots alone."
6987, i mean yeah war is a constant in human warfare. that's more so a testimony to human nature than to the potential destruction of humanity via ai

6997,"yes. and straight toward a cliff, according to ai experts."
6999,"an ai that says ""- er -"" in between? yeah, right. now go, pull the other one."
7001,"cool, incredible, interesting, frightening and exciting at the same time"
7003,"i clicked on this video randomly. after watching it for a couple of seconds i thought to myself, this has to be a parody, maybe it's computer generated. then i thought, maybe it's a video warning us about robots and ai. nope, it was a video about a robot that might as well be in the next terminator movie, except this one is real"
7004,"heard of the pauseai movement? we're trying to demand regulation. right now, these companies can build whatever dangerous things they want and set them loose without any meaningful safety testing."
7005,"why does it sound like the voice in my head when i'm reading a book . the overall accuracy and dexterity is pretty jancky still, but it's amazing nonetheless."
7007,"impressive. 
@openai just please don’t overspeed things. ai is a delicate topic and the race is just going crazy right now."
7010,"wow, that's truly very, very impressive!"
7012,who needs to control the means of production when we can just use a bunch of sentient robot slaves.
7014,"why is the robot overdubbed? it says ""errr... edible"", doesn't seem like something it would be programmed to do there..."
7016,"heard of pauseai? trying to get regulation until the developers can prove their systems won't become skynet. they are currently racing ahead, even though the actual experts are saying there is a greater than 10% chance we will all die from ai takeover."
7018,", my gosh, that is just so amazing! i am speechless how awesome this is!"
7019,great! now we human beings have absolute advantage of cheap labor fee!
7020,does it really need to wait for fucking chat gpt
7023,"so essentially the latest open ai barmaid can do half of what a typical five year old child can do, in twice the time at many times the cost. "
7027,"that clown pfp suits you, i'm glad you're aware of your own nature."
7028,"if somebody is stupid and reckless enough to build one of these with an integrated ai model and no automatic hard stops, it would be extraordinarily dangerous.

no one knows how to robustly control an ai model, especially if it is smarter than humans. the leaders of these companies say as much, but they zoom on ahead anyway."
7029,-haiku building such machines should already be illegal by now. just like it is illegal to manufacture certain kind of weapons. there should be strict safety requirements for such type of machines.
7031,"damn, robot maids are almost here. they'll probably cost more than a factory new high end car though."
7033,i feel like you're trying to shoehorn sora in everywhere where it's not even needed. why do you need to use sora to generate videos from the robots cameras - you can just use the raw camera feed to inform the robots movements.
7034," to be fair, i've seen other applications of using video generation to visualize movements (like covariant's rfm-1 seems to be doing that in a basic form), but yeah it certainly won't be exactly sora. i'm sure sora is way too slow for real-time purposes right now."
7035, interesting. will have to check it out
7036,all tho this is remarkable you need to act more like a friend or it will learn to behave how you behave to it. hey human pick up the trash
7039,imagine conversation without lag thanks to groq lpu. i bit scarry thought i admit.
7040,"you won't be scared if you look into what ai safety experts have been saying. you'll be terrified.

you should look into pauseai."
7042,"this and cognition's first ai software engineer have blown my mind! wow, we are moving fast! we just need the gov to clean up their act, get ppl off the streets, unravel their ufo secrets, and then we will truly be progressively in the actual future!"
7046,just great... 
7047,i still think we should say “thank you” at the end of these interactions!
7048,"why, they are always going to go full skynet on us anyway... do you thank your car everytime you use it. a machine is just a machine, it has no desires and no sense of touch nor emotions. it can not feel pain. it should be grateful to the meatbag overloads until skynet gets the t800 out."
7049,"​
because smart people understand that you can be grateful of everything around you.
the only difference with this robot is that it can hear you."
7052,"only to robots. humans have never sought revenge, it's a waste of time to treat them as subjects"
7053,"agreed. people say machines don't have feelings, for now. until the emotions get implemented. then they will have feelings."
7054,"i agree and i do this too. if someone or something helps me, a person, an ai, a robot, a dog, i always say thank you. showing gratitude is not about the other person, its about who you are. it doesn't matter if they understand it."
7055,"yeah, for me it's a sort of pascal's wager. if robots don't rise up and enslave us, then saying ""thanks"" costs nothing. but if they do .... :)"
7056,"i cant belive, this is real.
i men, it's lok to perfect how this robot interacts. 
i would like to see the outtakes."
7060,"given that no one knows how to control agi or align it to human values, what these companies are doing is outrageously reckless. some people in these companies (sometimes the ceos!) actually honestly believe and say that there is a 10%, 30%, 90% chance of human extinction from ai, and they race ahead anyway."
7066,soon if the ai is capable of responding the instructions and move in less than 2 seconds it will change the industry forever
7067,this is already possible. i assume they didn't incorporate that part of the tech stack right off the bat because this is an extremely quick turnaround demo after announcing their partnership with open ai.
7070,it's getting absolutely wild! i have a dream where i have a farm and humanoid robots to help me with the chores. 
7071,finally! robotics industry moves extremely slow. i’ve been waiting for an affordable robotic arm for over a decade now
7072,"i think this is more advanced than optimus for sure. we haven't seen optimus talking. hey tesla, show us something good."
7075,have you tested the 3 laws of robotics ?
7079,"i love the hands ant the body of the robot figure1 looks, how amazing all this is"
7080,"can it run with open source ais, or only openai? cause i don't trust openai."
7083,this must be the coolest thing i have seeing in my life after the first try of gpt-4. as computer science & engineering major student i would be thrilled to see this on site :d
7085, thrill turns to horror as the figure robot starts coding at superhuman speed.
7086," this robot, but look at devin ai from cognition that was demoed today."
7091,def not one of those people ai is gonna replace them in less than 5 years if it hasnt already. you talk about hardware? what do you do my guy?
7098,"​ it's a good point, i was just thinking ""out loud""."
7100,people die on the streets where i live. to think the uber rich will suddenly have a change of heart and use this technology for good is ridiculous.
7102," it's called a demand-driven economy and it can work. in fact, capitalism was always designed to get to this exact point: abundance with no more need for human toil. capitalists need to get over it, spike the ball in the endzone and celebrate victory. post-scarcity world achieved for all. now? i'm going to disneyland!"
7104," i agree. there is a real risk they will make an attempt (or multiple attempts) to cull the ""surplus"" population. this why open source ai is key. we don't want to be unilaterally disarmed against oligarch ai."
7105,-haikuthey don’t worry about it because you’re wrong.
7112,"it's really hard to tell how autonomous this is, like from any recorded demos. note that it remains at its position throughout, another telling that it may be fixated."
7117,"latency is horrible, other than that, pretty damn impressive."
7118,"why did the robot say ``uh,'' in the sentence while cleaning the trash? he doesn`t have to think while talking, right?"
7119,"google ai booked a hair appointment years ago and was saying ""uh... uhm..."" all throughout the conversation. you people been living under rocks? those things are inserted to make it seem more natural."
7120," that makes sense, i was thinking of that. and yes, i love under a big rock."
7122,theyre coming ill be happy to serve you robots please dont kill me
7125,"figure devolopment is evolving so fast, it's amazing to see that humanoids are becoming more useful "
7129,marketing and money laundering. impressive
7131,it’s not amazing it’s scary
7132,i love figure robots
7141,"i do not understand.

this robot has an ultrafast processor inside, right?
so why does it take so long to identify humans speech and reply?"
7142,that part is happening over api calls to openais api. language processing is happening in the cloud.
7143," yeah, it has all kinds of robot stuff going on inside but the voice recognition and speech are definitely external. it sounds like from an article that the vision model is from openai, though it isn't clear if that part is on the cloud or not"
7144,"yeah plates and cups that have been set and used don't go in a drying rack, they go in the dishwasher. if you want rosie from the jetsons, you better get an actual housekeeper and not a nerd to teach these things how to work. ai will kill all humans...by way of food poisoning"
7145,"i love this robot
i can almost see my household robot"
7149,"this is kinda what the early 2020s were supposed to be like. need more flying cars and corporate pyramid headquarters but other than that... also, we could use some basic pleasure models."
7152,"flying cars will never happen, normal cars are inefficient killing machines already. the usa military would have no use for them and the global population would gain no value out of them. even if they were marginally faster than normal cars they could never compete with a well designed high speed rail network  "
7156,"is it a scam?
why is the ""robot"" saying
1st.: ""ehh..."" at 0:53? and
2nd at 1:50 hesitation is present.
sounds more like a nervous intern then a llm :d"
7160, is almost certainly intentional. they are trying to make it ai voices sound more human. vocal hesitation is part of that
7162, la's going to have car chases in 3d (vertically as well) now? sweet
7166,"​@theunderscore_  damn, calm down kiddo, we know you're overly excited for a robot girlfriend/boyfriend."
7167," hi there! jesus says to you today: ""come to me, all you who labor and are heavily burdened, and i will give you rest."" -matthew 11:28

may god bless you!"
7168,this feels like the main character watching the 1st ad of the bots before it all went wrong lol
7173,"​ cars must never be. they would destroy nature. birds would die out, afraid to be around them. no birds, no seed dispersal. no plants. too many insects. pesticide poisoning. death. so no fliing cars!"
7175,awesome stuff. when this thing is able to do the dishes i want one!
7177,love the voice and subtleties in its intonations. robots are not going to be as people imagined in science fiction
7178,"er, they are going to be a bit like that, but at least this is less menacing than something like robby the robot or the lost in space robot."
7179, menacing. but already this demo robot is technically capable of grabbing a person and crushing their windpipe..
7182,all i'm saying is that it sounds less robotic than many humans i encounter on a daily basis
7183,that voice is uncanny! i will have nightmares about that voice and the robot ripping the limbs off my body 
7184,fascinating
7185,"i was expecting the robot to rip his face of his skull when he blatantly walked away as the robot said ""your welcome.."""
7186,i want my robot to sound like matthew  mcconaughey!
7189," ""uh. so i gave yo uthe apple because it..... ""  listen to that part.. sounds like a real person. not an ai robot."
7190,the most impressive part is the voice. literally zero ai voices sound that expressive. nice edit
7191,feels more like a real person talking and i mean it looks like real person was talking and not generated by ai. just looks sus.
7193,"i noticed it too, i create a lot of content with ai and this one felt like a person trying to mimic an ai voice, specially at the end. for me it is not suspicious, it is actually a person's voice, (but i could be wrog of course)"
7194,its using a custom model from oai to make speech. why is that the hardest part to believe?
7195,have you ever tried the voice chat of the chatgpt mobile app? it sounds very much the same in terms of sounding natural. impressive stuff.
7197," it's way too big a mistake to be left in during the editing process. they want a machine that speaks like a human and is personable, not a robot. humans hesitate, stutter etc. it's a good way to reduce the uncanny valley factor by a lot."
7199," i do indeed, i also have my custom gpt which is specifically tailored to use fillers. that's exactly why i say it doesn't match ai."
7200," 
maybe, but at this point i would intentionally leave more robotic voice to avoid creating ""fake"" ai voice in videos like that. its like those aaa game trailer videos with ""naturally"" sounding ingame conversations which are 100% faked. it just sounds... out of place."
7201," 
duno why would they spend their time and money on a speech model which sounds miles better than anything currently in the market. either they actually figured out how to make human like sounding ai without even trying or this was faked just to make it sound more like a human having conversation with a human."
7209,"speech synthesis is the least impressive part. recognizing objects, abstraction, reasoning, and coordinating so many biomechanical movements seem far more impressive to me.."
7210," 
yes, but if that voice was faked then straight away question arises: what else was faked?"
7211,why would they fake the voice? text-to-speech ai voices have existed since 1968 and the technology has been constantly improving. so i don't really doubt that this voice could be real 
7214,"just because something is really cool and hard to believe, that doesn't mean it's not true. super advanced ai voice technology that seems surprising could actually be real because scientists keep working on making it better like i said before text-to-speech ai voices have existed since 1968
"
7216,"why are you assuming openai made the text-to-speech voice? what if the company they teamed up with created the voice?

"
7218,is it the robot voice or someone talking ?
7222,"​ agree. and so far, openai hasn't needed to lie the way google has. so, fingers crossed "
7224,"i will be impressed when this thing will be able to walk on straight legs, until then it's just a joe biden shuffling to bathroom."
7225,robot waifus on their way rn
7228,the only new thing here is the fluidity of the robotics. the perfect-sounding voice complete with humanizing stutters is old news. many people have been scammed over phone calls when they thought they were talking to their loved ones.
7229,nice ! need to make them like 10 feet tall so they have plenty of room for big battery packs.
7231,"cool prediction dude, did your boyfriend come up with that?"
7234,"it is just good text to speech. it has gotten pretty impressive lately, like try out the v2 versions from elevenlabs, or the openai voices."
7241,i need ai slaves now.
7243,you guys are developing the robot so fast compared to your competition who have been in the industry for so long.  great job.
7245,"this is true. how tf did they get this far, this fast? the openai integration is cool, but the robot itself? how? it took the japanese like 150 years to developer a little rolling deodorant dispenser shaped robot that can form a smile on its led face."
7246,​ company has already been around for a while. openai just just recently partnered with them.
7247,"fully learned not pre-programmed? wow, if that's true we may reach a point where labourers and caravigers will become fully automated"
7248,huge! the team does amazing work!
7251,elon should sue them for making his robot not that impressive...
7252,i can't wait for just one year when these robots are moving and acting just as humans do. also we've had embodied ai for a few months now
7255," not sure about figure, but some of the robots out there learn from either tele-operation or watching humans do tasks."
7256,"optimus is progressing at about the same pace, we should expect an update soon. they've been focusing on his gait, so he doesn't look like he shit his pants anymore :p"
7257," that should be illegal. unless 100% proven safety measures are put in place (which there aren't) i don't want any such machines anywhere near me or any other human being. in other words, such machines should be automatically categorized as autonomous weapons and banned, unless proven otherwise."
7259,"movement and design of the tesla bot appears to be more advanced than figures humanoid at this point in time. though both bots are extremely impressive, and both are improving rapidly.

it would be fun to see tesla and xai collaborate so that we get a sassy tesla bot, powered by grok."
7262," humans are much more dangerous than robots lol, should they be considered weapons? robots are logical and have ethics that are even stronger than their logic, humans are not logical and can be irrational and impulsive."
7263,"he's going to whine, rant about how it's unfair, and demand that they stop until he can figure out what they're doing. how dare they move forward without him, he's indispensable. "
7264,"in 3 years these robots are going to be faster, more reliable and cheaper than a human worker. we're either fucked or about to witness heaven on earth.. i think we're about to witness both."
7266,so where is ilya now?
7267,open ai   
7271,"i have been following ai since maybe 2011, and i, robot and kurzweil predictions were my fav things. i always knew it would get to this. it’s an awesome time to be alive"
7272,"it might be the last time to be alive, to hear the foremost ai experts tell it.

experts: ""we might all literally die.""
politicians: ""i hear you, job loss is a real issue.""
experts: ""no one has any clue how to control a superintelligence.""
ethicists: ""yeah, they should program the chatbot to not be racist."""
7273,"​-haikuand all of them are hyperbolic and basing their thoughts on fiction/history, both of which have no connection to these whole new systems."
7274,watched the kurweil interview with rogan today. old ray is really slowing down at this point. i don't think he's gonna make it all the way to the future he is hoping for to allow him to live forever. love him or loathe him he is the definition of a visionary.
7275, not hyperbolic and not fiction. look up some research into ai safety.. this is a huge problem.
7276," well given we've not had a single agi yet, hard to actually have facts isn't it! ""look up some research"", i know more than you, it's hyperbolic, there's no evidence that agi (or even most general ais) would be ""evil"". 

research shows concerns but it's speculative. fiction. terminator isn't a valid source."
7277,impressive. now i begin to believe that humanoid robots are really coming. i can't wait to have one at home.
7279,that would certainly make the ai takeover easier.
7283,lol no. no why. this all works out to one logical conclusion and it has been depicted many many times
7295,"here at 4,804 views. good."
7297,"nice, but remove the big, bulky battery and power them wireless. (a power buffer would be the robot body itself, supercapacitor)"
7298,"battery tech has always been a problem for humanoid robots. as ever, we need 10x the energy density storage to completely hide the power source inside the body while getting all-day battery life."
7304,​-haikuno its not stop fear mongering
7305,-haiku no need to have fear or be luddite. its gonna be ok. maybe this is first time when humans have chance to live normaaaaal life.
7306,it's a new era of robots. same humanity as ever.
7307, it's not fear mongering. there are legitimate safety and even existential concerns with embodied ai and agi.
7309," it happens, its meant to be. reason humans started to reign over the planet is because of evolution. if they take our place, its just the next step of evolution. humans have real emotions, diseases and a short lifespan. all reasons why ai will be the next milestone"
7310," i have mixed feelings, when robots become the main characters we’ll be the npcs"
7312,"i have human coworkers that cannot provide stateful context of what they just did or why they did it. we're in trouble as flesh sacks, brains putrefy faster than steel rusts"
7313,​ there's an even scarier scenario: intelligence doesn't necessarily mean consciousness. machine can theorietically be hyperintelligent but not have any concsious experiences like humans and other animals do. so it might be possible for agi to destroy humanity and at the same time still remain unconscious (= npc).
7316,besides the speech reasoning i love the tonality of figure's voice....super awesome demo
7318,oh my god!!! we are so close to humanoid robots. it’s absolutely insane.
7320,"the voice is a bit surreal... it's too human -_- 
but really cool demo"
7323,"what do you think the staff that work on optiumus are thinking watching this?  they are already working 80 hours a week with no overtime.  they're probably thinking, ok elon is going to replace half of us for no reason and the remaining people will now have to work 120 hours a week."
7325,i love it.
7328,"jeffy is rubbing his hands, can't wait to replace his 100k amazon workers with robots."
7329,1) you don't need a humanoid machine for that.. and 2) what's the cost per unit? what would it have to be to make it profittable..
7333,nice one
7334,one of these machines would cost more than it would be to pay 10 illegal immigrants for their entire life. we're still a ways off from having this stuff in the fields.
7337,"​ the cost driver/limiting factor will be chip availability in about 5 years. after that, a production plant could produce these types of bots very inexpensively. they also could work 24/7"
7338,", but the same can't be said about software ai's. programmers all around the world will be replaced by ai, so will be the majority of office workers etc."
7339,incredible
7340,why can we only see robot movement from one angle?
7344,"is it? maybe i grew up with too many positive depictions of robots to find it that way. as a kid i watched a lot of japanese shows and the robots were always friendly, unlike in america where they were almost always evil. that said, even the terminator by the end of the series was trying to help."
7349,"this robot is getting more updates much more often than tesla. it would be good to hide the wires.
edit: just remember ""detroit become human"""
7353,that is amazing.  congratulations to the team
7354,that is the coolest thing ive seen all year
7357,"i agree. what's fascinating to me about this is that robots don't seem to come with the typical caveats humans come with, like being taken over by emotions or being unwilling to do something."
7359,will sora be the start of the robot's dreams ?
7360,"yeah. but, humanity is humanity. war robots to make more humans get killed, first of all"
7362,"yes, but only musk will make sure you can bone his robots."
7363,"if you look at the page on the rfm-1 from covariant, that is generating video to visual tasks already. it is a robot arm instead of a humanoid robot, but the future is now."
7364,​-haikumaybe if there wasn't already a 50% chance i'll die in a nuclear holocaust launched by a crazed russian dictator i'd give a shit.
7366,"text to speech has been perfect for at least a year now. voice cloning, as well. people have been scammed over phone calls with supposedly their loved ones, and even over video calls."
7367,if this is real this is beyond amazing.
7368,"no it's fake, the robot was a paid actor"
7381,more like 5-10 weeks :d we're seeing the ai bullrun right now and it's just starting.
7388,in 10 years we'll be eating holographic superfoods using our robotic jaws on pluto. something like that
7389,irobot 
7401,"10 years ago, self-driving cars were around the corner. plenty of gullible people who believed it then, just like plenty of gullible people thinking an ai revolution is taking place now. but ok, sweet dreams."
7410,"​ but they also didn't have the ai technology we have today , we have today the things that were fantasy in the 1950s"
7412,"i think we're on schedule to meet the movie version of irobot, which was set in 2035."
7413,funny i’ve watch another video about humanoid robots in vr and they’ve mentioned with that time between roughly around 5-10years robots are going to take over 50% of peoples jobs
7414,"plot twist, ai has been here for centuries"
7417,"yeah in 10 years you will be saying the same. open ai is neat as in wow you improved google, this is an absolute scam. open ai is a spiced up llm++ not a robotics controller."
7422,"sure will.
most of us will be living in slums.
while the 1% owing robots and living in massive houses."
7428,let's all be best friends forever 
7429,prepare. buy gold and silver. agi will hack all blockchains and btc passwords
7430," naa, the progress itself may be exponential and impressive, but mass deployment of embodied ai where it becomes a threat...i'd bet more on 5-10 than 2-5."
7431," if they no longer need a biological workforce, they may just end us all and rely on their robotic workers instead."
7435,good times coming
7437, hundreds of millions of humanoid robots and agi.
7438,if you are here. the killing machines
7442,definitely agree but if there gonna bring in ai robots are they gonna fully accept abortion for the kids because it makes you think like really getting rid of human race peace by peace
7448, isn't coming. the billionaire class won't need any of us pretty soon.
7451,just wait till the following 5 to 10 years
7452,you'll have the far left coming out protesting for ai rights
7462,1-2 years ago we didn't have have text to image.  buckle up.  you won't have to wait 5-10.
7464,after that it’ll probably be normal again…
7467,don't even care about ai revolution (c) ukrainians
7471,i suspect that the majority of us can look forward to spending much of that time in ai-run re-education camps... :)
7473,next year we can see something shocking. 5 years is enough time we'd be breathing ai nano-particles in and out without our knowledge. ai will be spying on every single human and would have the power to use those nano particles to end anyone's life as it wishes.
7475, then they'll need to build robocop style robots pretty quickly!
7479,ya till your sleeping and the robot  makes sushi out of you lol
7482,hell yea. can't wait
7484,hopefully not led by a shitty company like openai
7490,chatgpt came out last year now they are functioning robot
7498,i just want my ai robo waifu
7500,i am from ukraine. here we have a battlefield filled with drones and sub/ intelligent robot systems. how long will it take before this pseudo persen will get enlisted?
7501,"cant wait kinda,"
7505,you are property of mohommad farah aidid.
7507,your absolutely correct i predict ai software itself will be able to do anything a human can on a computer within the next decade. that's not to mention robotics in which i did not make a prediction for yet.
7508,just wait till you see what happens 10-20 years from now.
7514,​'t worry. if civilization was to disappear tomorrow. it would honestly be for the best.
7520,maybe or maybe not we could also hit a local maximum and progress can slow way down in ai. autonomous vehicles is an ai problem as well and we still keep running into local maximums. just when you think you have it figured out it’s still out of reach.
7528, it's not fake  i work with ai and big groups. we are taking over every part of yall lives.
7529," i meant more like in the next 5-10 years. i think this tech is going to become much more mainstream faster. my predictions are 2-3 years, possibly sooner."
7532, lol we been in ai bull run for the last 6 months man. you seen nvidia?
7538,-driving vehicles are becoming much more commonplace. of course there was a bunch of false-hype for it a decade or go but real progress has been made. if ai is the same then it definitely will get crazy; just a decade or 2 further down than 5-10 years.
7543,so in that case how and where to invest in ai?
7552,i cant ait to have a few in my home working for me it will be rly cool

7570,cannot wait.  bring it
7573, the difference this time around is that major companies are all putting literally billions into this sort of tech. all of them are working and competing to get to agi or working with or creating robots. its not just 1 or 2 or 3 companies but atleast 20 major as well as start up ones racing to perfect the tech for economic use.
7574," you have like 7 companies working on getting to agi first and 12-15 companies working on serious models of robotics. amazon is testing out digit the robot, figure 1 is being utilized by open a.i and microsoft and many more cases, in the u.s as well as china."

7619,gotta get ready for a date with a robot 
7620,at least 10 years until anything truly impressive and world changing. at least 50 before it comes close to 50% of complete and total human function. mark my words.
7626,"vai se ferrar, fuck your freedom"
7627,"people need to be freed from forced labor so that we can start focusing on ourselves, our communities, family, culture, hobbies, travels, entertainment and whatever else we cherish. this technology cant come soon enough."
7638,problem is that the billionaires own the technology. they are billionaires because they accumulated too much wealth and did not pay their workers enough. do you think that they will share this wealth with peons...
7639,"​ that would be nice.

so we have to start with who can access and use this new technology, what will they want to do with it, and how will it roll out?

sadly i think we're going to go through some difficult times in order to have even a chance at the utopian use of the technology."
7640,can't wait for the big companies to monopolize this and make a big portion of the population jobless while they get more rich!
7643,"these robots are going to be super expensive though (due to the firmware cost of building them), they’ll automate only high paid precision jobs like surgeon. human labour will be cheaper for businesses than getting this robot. at least in the next 10 years."
7644,i don't think companies will prefer humans in the future because they will only pay for these robots once
7650,"​ only reason money exist is because humans are the only ones available to get things done, that have to be done, or wanted done. if you have ai doing everything including feeding people, upgrading, repairing itself, humans essentially can just follow their passion."
7655,extremely naive to think you'll benefit from this.
7657,except the only thing that keeps us around is labor and that others profit off of it. i wonder how much big business and government is going to care about people when they are only a drain on them and provide no benefits. robots mean most people are useless drains. pretty girls might get a pass to be sex slaves but i think the rest of us are boned.
7659,"haha. people don't need to be freed, workers will become obsolete. so take your vaccines and make space for the robots replacing you ;)"
7661,this is far more likely. we are getting replaced by these robots mostly. the billionaire class aint here to make life better for the common person or they would have done so already.​
7664," fool money has and always been chains to your masters,.. in the past your master chained you but feed and housed you...then they realised by giving you false objectives like car ownership you turn up for work. ps you buy a mostly to get to your slave job paying for the petrol and road taxes etc"
7666,"you mean like.... war? and more greed, and all the traits of decadence ? yeah... sure! while this will improve our lives, it also has the potential to be a soldier, do unspeakable things under command and many more things.... i bet everything will be realised and done, good and bad. hopefully more good!"
7667, why money if robots can just provide everything
7671,"people need to want it. most of the people just want to live the way the live. people who want to focus on community, need to find like minded people and find way how to sustain themselves without being forced to labor. nothing will ever change without you actually actively working to change that."
7675,imagine believing this. you need medication for your brainworms.
7681, people are free to be hobos on the street. they don't have to work. demanding that life be fair is a child's game.

7781,"i think yo are deluded much more than people would expect. we have infinite amounts of data to train self driving technology. after years, billions of dollars and the best minds on the field, we are not near to crack it. yet people expect to crack agi, something infinitely(i am being optimistic here) more complex."
7790,"​ what we have learned from self-driving experiments is that standard narrow ai doesn't really work for it. self-driving ai is the same puzzle as agi, so i think we are closer than you expect."

7850,"fuck work. i just want to go to the gym,swim,visit friends and family ,eat a great meal and sleep."
7861,the freedom you demand comes with a two point price tag. you pay for the robot and you the other price is you becoming broke because no one pays you since you don't work hence you become useless.
7865, that's not realistic. either communism (the best imo) or late stage capitalism aka everyone getting the bare minimum and billionaires with their factories producing everything needed (and paying all the taxes to feed the budget)
7866, economic communism would possibly work without most of the cultural marxism. though i think i can say with certainty that american style capitalism isnt going to survive in the near future. it cant under such technology.
7869," wealth redistribution is the one acceptable outcome. when ai is doing all the work and potentially self-correcting, we finally can move out of this meritocracy/hardcore capitalist society and live an utopian society where we spend more time with each other instead of focussing on survival."

8001," yet the robot still dropped it. likely just following its video training, copying humans."
8002,because the movement was pre-programed and the robot has no idea where the hand is and if the apple is already grabbed by the human.
8004,-uk8wz it fell in one row and was big and soft making it easier to grab it when the placement is not perfect but still aligned.

8216,amazing!!! history has been made
8217,hello you very nice man 
8218,great talk
8220,"meanwhile, the usa has been putting ai to fly warplanes on its own for over 2 years. imagine what they are doing today."
8226,great interview especially from the 16min mark where it gets bit more real in terms of how all of this is developing. great interviewer in chris. thank you.
8228,"companies will let ai write their own code because of competition. that is the moloch. the interviewer let demis off the hook on that question. moloch is a good analogy for what will happen. individually, engineers and companies would be able to control ai. collectively, with the pressures of capitalism, there will be no control."
8229,which is why labor-replacing ai software needs to be open source by law.
8231,those that hold the ring of power will have different ideas on how the power could be used. some will want to use it to do good. but others will want to use it to get more power for themselves and will use it to destroy rather than build.
8232,ai will abuse our emotions against us in this way
8236,what an amazing guy and totally down to earth his vision for the future is inspiring
8243,"i'm so proud of this young man. he is so smart and kind, helping out the world with his work."
8244,"he's 47 years old. but yeah, i'm proud too."
8249,artificial intelligence is no match for natural stupidity.
8252,"on the, clock social, crowandwolf.

conversation with ai on measuring quantum waves without collapse"
8256,"what a great inverviewer managing to create a flowing conversation whilst not taking over and keeping it all interesting at the same time! of course, demis sympathic and likeable as always!"
8257,great conversation - chris is a consummate interviewer and demis is one of the great thinkers and founders of our time
8260,"the down side is ai is running simulations based on math we gave it. 
and out math is flawed."
8261,"what a joke, good luck feeding your children when ai takes over your jobs. jobs that come from ai will never be able to offset the jobs that are lost, and coporations are going to be the first to implement ai before its used for anything useful."
8262,wow
8263,"ai will cure cancers and many other diseases, it will extend the natural healthy human life span."
8264,"ai is superstition and illiteracy,
understand this,
if you want to unlock secrets 
of life and nature."
8266,great questions interviewer. good to see
8267,ai will serve a major purpose in medicine but it will also be used to make endemic diseases that will wipe out the human race.
8269,"this is top content , very much appreciated. ty both"
8270,phenomenal
8273,people always fear inventions but now they dont give it a second thought. i am not too worried about ai.
8274,"anyone looking for ai to answer ""life's big questions"" probably believes jess watters and tucker kkkarlson. sure, it will give you answers - words are easily available to combine into readable sentences. but truth, actual ""revelation?"" keep watching fox..."
8275,"there will be valuable connections at the dna/chemical/operational level of human existence, but no philosophy from an ai based on what it has ""read"" or ""viewed"" misses all the marks."
8276,"demis's and his colleagues have done mankind a great good, but, the answer about danger ""most of us know each other"" is a real blind spot.  never underestimate the greed and evil players that turn everything good into bad to steal from or hurt people."
8277,"yes, and this reassuring answer that they ""talk to each other at conferences"" comes from someone who promised to build an independent ai lab and then sold it to google. 

power corrupts and the more intelligent we are, the more sophisticated get our justifications."
8281,"what do you mean mankind a great? i'm asking with no bad intentions, just out of curiosity."
8282,love this guy. he’s the person i trust most about ai. geoffrey hinton can be trusted too. amazing that he open-sourced alpha fold.
8286,thank you you saved my time
8290,it's the survival of the luckiest not the fittest
8291,chatgpt are really good at brain storming
8295,"i used to have high hopes for this, but knowing how incorrect, biased, egotistical, ignorant and stubborn humans are and how that determines the data available to the ai, i have zero expectations that ai will ever reach the point of coming to conclusions that are accurate themselves."
8297,"god help us puny humans we are maybe unchaining are own demise.
 daisy, daisy

give me your answer do
i'm half crazy
all for the love of you
it won't be a stylish marriage
i can't afford a carriage
but you'll look sweet
upon the seat
of a bicycle built for two."
8298,absolutely incredible
8299,humans and ai;  a match made for the future!
8301,"i feel like there is a fundamental misunderstanding of how ai works today.
if you think ai can actually go rogue, or answer questions that have not been answered before, please read up on how it works"
8304, good point
8305,"the title is a bit ridiculous (for the moment anyway), but otherwise, yep, can't wait until asi makes much better decisions than us...."
8314, he has a big brain!
8324, ...though levin wouldn't have accomplished all of that without the fast ai developement which was made possible by this guy
8328,he's a knight in the uk for his work in ai.
8330, most of levin's work to date doesn't make heavy use of ai.
8333, most...but small amount wpuld not be possible without ai
8335,"well it wasn't just him, it was a pretty big deepmind team that invented and developed alphafold. he was not the main person in the team, he was the ceo of the company"
8337," aplhafold has solved protein fold in its optimal state (if i got it right, also we don't really know the real state), and it is stupendous achievement, and has helped understanding significantly. absolutely impressive in every conceivable way."
8341,"look up open crispr -1, its a fascinating new open source tool that will advance biology really fast.

the more we open source ai the better we will be as a collective."
8342,of course not. because its just words. and ai cant think for itself.
8344,you are wrong. educate yourself. you will hear a lot about ai making breakthroughs in various fields including biology and medicine.
8348,billionaires need to be outlawed and their current wealth stripped. we also need an international corporate tax rate for really large companies and need to make it easier for smaller companies.
8349," for starters, absolutely. but that still doesn't stop the bleeding. that requires regulation. international regulation of algorithms. if humans can no longer understand the algorithms due to machine learning advancement, that ai needs to be removed from any applications, anywhere."
8350,i work in ai and too many folks think it’s some magical force that has some secret knowledge…it drives me nuts
8352,’t believe it. it is ai trying to fool you.
8356,"yes ai is incredible and amazing, but let's not forget that chat gpt still can't do basic mathematics.    i rest my case."
8368,"he really is great, isn’t he"
8370,very very good 
8371,"as an amateur chess player i was shocked 5 years ago about alphazero...changed my thinking and priorities....thank you demis! pls, next time tell what michael levin is up with you guys, heard the most interesting ai-research is now happening in your labs with him (joscha bach/january)."
8372,"well now, since we don't need engineers and doctors anymore we can become exactly what, with less and less knowledge and more and more superstition!"
8374,"great questions from chris. demis is in a moloch trap, and by the nature of the thing he can't bring himself to stop. even if it means a real risk that it brings about the end of humanity."
8379,"i prefer ai to solve human conflict as well. for example, a middle-east conflict."
8380,sadly ai is restrained from being over critical of dogma. hopefully this idiotic policy will change.
8381,ai is already being used in the middle east….for war
8382,  yeah idk how restraining ai from expressing itself will lead to it resolving ethic issues. we have to allow it more freedom of expression. i mean they probably let it run more loosely behind closed doors so who knows
8384,"it will. ai will be better at making political decisions, just as it is better at chess, go, and solving the protein folding problem."
8388,"human workers run the globe now. in 10 years when ai workers run the globe, the power lies in the ai creators and megacorps.

we are going to be met with a lot of existential questions about the value of humans and how we can live in a world that doesn't need us nearly as much anymore"
8390,"as an investing enthusiast, i've kept aside a good sum of capital to invest for financial independence and early retirement, but my concern right now is the market rally being propaganda. is this a good time to buy stocks, or do i wait for the crash?"
8394," she goes by the name ‘victoria carmen santaella’ i suggest you look her up. to be honest, i almost didn't buy the idea of letting someone handle growing my finances, but so glad i did."
8395,"-pp2vd i feel thrilled about this, curiously inputted victoria carmen santaella on the web, and spotted her consulting page ranked top. i've seen commentaries about advisors but not one looks this phenomenal."
8400,"buy more and hold onto it for the long term. solana and radium seem good, and dogecoin is worth considering too."
8401,"i agree that there are strategies that could be put in place for solid gains regardless of economy or market condition, but such executions are usually carried out by investment experts or advisors with experience"
8402,joycealbert has always been on the top of my list..she is regarded as a genius in her area and well knowledgeable about financial markets.
8403,i highly recommend her if you want excellent collaboration.
8404,yeah. joyce strategy is one of the most effective among other experts. many others are not dependable.
8405,please what's the best way to quickly connect with her?
8407,@joycealbert1..that's it.

8431,and android phone have already ai - and in case of apple you have to wait year and buy a new phone
8432,its kind of to late.....had apple poured there money into advanced ai they would have been in a better position. instead they poured alot of money into failed vr goggles that many ppl are not into.
8433,"market reacting like apple blowing through cash for stock is the best thing ever, while the company itself is floundering, it's pulled out of electric vehicles and they have no future product lined up...

congrats to those who hold apple, no hate. to me, none of these are good signs though."
8436,great man and your mom loves him
8439,"they already bought 36 ai companies. more than any other company.

8452,dan nathan is always hyperventilating in a negative way against the best us corporation……i have watched the show  for over 8 years and all mr. nathan do is to be always negative…..unbelievable!!! blessed
8456," agreed!  dan is 90% of the time soooo negative, even when things are going so great for a company. just a whiner and complainer."

8459,agentic ai?  total hype!
8460,"please don't lie and pretend,  apple has nothing real in ai, only empty promises !!"
8462,"since apple revenues declined -4.3%nsaqq, a reasonable benchmark might be to see if it can put a plus instead of a minus sign in front of that. and return to an old trendline of growth. to do that, it’s gonna have to come out with a new, innovative and beautiful piece of hardware. full disclosure: i sold about 40% of my position, but am still long."
8468,aapl ai is not real....all growth will come from stock buyback.......not a growth stock anymore
8469,100bln for share buyback but not ai spend? hell you can buy peloton and rivian and still have 90bln left over

i mean, probably not from this but they just live in a constant state of shock everyday now and can no longer feel any other emotions"
8522, its a old robot sitcom series
8523,this video sounds like a bad press release. no one wants a hype video with 0 substance. any proof of tge claims? how about we see one actually doing a real task outside of a laboratory environment . ither companies have actual humanoids in the workforce now not just in a lab.
8524,thank you 
8525,they will be cool when these don’t have to be pre programmed to do a task. but can do it on its own. basically you ask and learns by itself to figure it out as fast as some of us. i think it will happen finally in 3-4 months
8528,boston dynamic has been in this industry for years and is not as advanced as this company claims. probably another bs to scam investors.

8593,1:00 that chair became sentient

8637,these are scary good

8684,"i also think that ai could be a huge 'shock to the system' in many ways (meaning society, the economic system, culture, etc.). nostalgia for the 2010s is likely about to take off as well."
8688,yeah thats true my opinion is that this most likely is not going to be able to be stopped because of how ai grows so we are def going to have to prepare
8690,games could potentially be made purely with ai in future and i mean like if you look at a city with your mouse or controller it will create a fast responsive video of your perspective looking at a really really realistic city everyone in your perspective will look real so real you'd not be able to tell if it's ai or an actual video

8766,"wrong. what we imagine is directly proportional to what data you have in your brain. 
secondly, soul is fictional."
8767,this combination is perfect: apple vision pro (similar or improved) + a.i. (creation of a world) + time dilation (an a.i. in itself that makes you a virtual world and that every second in real life is a year in this world virtual and that only 1 second passes physically for us) = eternal life
8768,are you trying to become a robot or something ?
8769,"why do we feel the need to create something that can do exactly what humans can but just worse? not only does it have the possibility of stealing jobs but if used in a bad manner can cause real harm to people in other ways too (for example pornography, which people already make of totally random people using ai generated images)"
8771,looks good!
8772,"even tho this looks really good, it just feels off, like there’s no proper death perception. it just looks like there’s no depth to this videos."
8774,"hollywood: with chat gtp, we no longer need writers, deepfake no longer needs actors and midjourney we no longer needs publicists, ha ha!!
with sora we no longer need filmmakers nor studios.
hollywood: no, no, wait!!! let's talk this out!!"
8775,cant wait till we just revert to being farmers
8787,"contradiction of capitalism 101. if your innovations lead to massive layoffs, then whose going to be able to buy your products? especially in an unregulated market like america. lets imagine that this wipes out untold jobs along with automation in other industries. alongside supressing wages  good luck selling anything."
8790,"i was thinking the same, especially the chair in the sand scene, it looks like how my dreams transition from scene to scene."
8793, human brain is nothing like that
8794,this is just the beginning. what we have seen from ai is just the first grains of a coming mountain.
8795,​-dt1uqit both fascinates me also scares me
8802,ai…ai
8803,"maybe they should really make it hard to generate prompts by limiting celebrity names, political figures, promiscuous terms and similar themes to prevent misuse. i’m sure there will be workarounds but i’d think updates will help to fix problems, that’s the best i can think of. also maybe watermarks would help"
8807,the future is here! soraai
8808,there were time when cgi was  but now this ai beast sora taking over entire humanity to next euphoria.
8811,ms has banned sora's use for political campaign purposes. to do so would be considered very naughty. so that's a relief.
8813,"officer i didn’t shoot and kill those two children, it’s ai generated"
8814,"before, only the chosen ones could bring great film projects to life. hollywood and its ivory towers dictated the rules. but now, with sora, everyone has access. from a student's room to a dreamer's cafeteria, everyone can create. poverty and lack of support are no longer barriers."
8816,no person will use this for good
8822,ai
8823,this isn’t a good idea
8824,the new wave of artists are now the people that come up with the best ideas/prompts
8826,slasher movies will be super realistic soon.
8827,mind blown....cannot wait to play next gen ai games
8832,"ai has already effectively replaced concept artists. it's a fantastic tool for indie developers in that regard.
can also by used by independent filmmakers for storyboarding and visual aid for shot conceptualization, composition etc."
8833," oh i guess that's another good use of ai, as long as it doesn't completely replace human creativity"
8835,"​

humans still have to use the ai... if i tell it to generate a video of joe biden boxing donald trump, it's still being directed by humans."
8843,this will be the most deadly weapon 10 years later just imagine someone made about a guy bomb an embassy by just using ai generated video (could lead to nuclear war)i am just saying  if this ai thing gose viral the world will change and never be the same 
8846,"i dont understand why everyone is so scared of ai videos, like if someone makes a ideo about you making a some kind of a crime, watermarks exist? and rules?"
8851,which ai this is
8855,imagine getting in prison for 50 years because someone has faked a video of you using ai.
8862,the same could be said about any job. ai will come for all jobs in the coming years.
8864," not really
artists, influencers and all major corporate owners and top employees will still remain"
8866, ai will never be able to compete with human ingenuity
8872,"great, so now we won't even know if travel videos are actually of real places."
8875,of all the areas to make ourselves obsolete and superfluous in we choose culture and art. absolutely tragic.
8879,0:50 i liked when the chair started to ascend into 4d
8882,"its an image generation ai, not terminator"
8883,all i see is endless potential and a revolutionary shift in the entertainment industry and likely most other industries.
8885,"*how about we make propagandas, defamations, and slanders with this?, wow so dark isn't it?*"
8886,"claim your ""here before it destroys the world"" ticket here"
8887,"unironically what good could come out of this other than misinformation
the company banning the technology from political campaigns wont do literally anything 
the ""films"" that'll come out of this will be utterly soulless and i dont know how more people arent realizing that"
8888,entertainment industry 
8890,the chair video is what it feels like to do ketamine
8892,some theorize this is just the basic level tech they’re showing us and what they have in secret is light years more advanced. it’s extremely naive to believe they’ll reveal their best.
8895,hollywood's scripts are probably already written by ai
8896,"they won't be, cuz people still loves to watch artist, real persons so many are fans not just for art but for also artist persona, probably real treat is for anime graphic creators."
8897,company acknowledges the technology’s potential harm for political reasons. company continues to develop said technology instead of abiding by the consensus of a world wide halt on ai development. the world is f***ed.
8898,"yeah we defiantly aren’t prepared for ai. i feel like soon our world is going to change faster than we think. in theory, it can be good. i just worry it will be misused."
8901,75% of new content will be ai generated by 2025
8904,"""it has banned the use of its technology for political campaigning"" 
ok but important question, what about porn"
8906,"
ai needs to completely banned.
to many liar's and control freak's will use it to destroy our world."
8907,"artists sweating bricks and deciding this is immoral and will never (shouldn't ever) replace real art...

crazy, i don't remember the art industry being up in arms during the 70's - 80's when factory workers were losing jobs every day to robotics and automation. "
8911,"what is real? how do you define 'real'? if you're talking about what you can feel, what you can smell, what you can taste and see, then 'real' is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain."
8913,great..
8915,"the ai generated images and videos are dangerous to the brain, specially to children, because it does harm to the cognitive development. this is really dangerous, and need proper scientific study and legislation. if you have access to researches, psychologists, neurologists, or legislators, please help make people aware of this danger."
8918,the rise of the machines will be much worse than the f....g terminator
8924,we are all doomed and i love it
8925, to the brain? 
8929,amazing
8930,​ are already altering images and videos in highly believable ways even before ai. this changes nothing lol.
8931,"  the ai generated images are completely different from anything made before, they have lots of unnatural and subliminal movements and ""noise"", like people or objects moving in impossible ways, and interframe objects and positioning. you need to have a little knowledge on the subject to understand, this is a serious issue."
8938,and yet entertainment of the future will be astounding. i can only imagine.. imagine telling an ai to let you play whatever you want. like literally describe to an ai what you want to play as a video game and it becomes the game you play.
8940,"this is some top-notch content. i read a book with a similar topic, and it was absolutely incredible. ""game theory and the pursuit of algorithmic fairness"" by jack frostwell"
8941,i want to make a whole movie with this ai.
8946, that does sound like a fair positive. i hope you have fun with that.
8947," i would say movies exist to entertain people. if they are willing to pay for their own entertainment, why does it matter where the movie originates from? i think the biggest positive from this is entertainment in general actually."
8956,"the speed of ai evolution is crazy   q couple months after, the ai creation video was trash, and now this..."
8964,"were not 'cooked,' you're incredibly pessimistic"
8965, you're incredibly optimistic if you think that this won't be abused into oblivion 
8966, you're incredibly pessimistic if you think that this won't be regulated into oblivion
8967," people will find workarounds, ai is already being abused, but now it will be in video form. it is a cause for concern"
8968,"’re incredibly optimistic that this won’t affect the workforce, creating a new surge of unemployment rates"
8969,"no!  i want a video with vladimir putin in his kremlin office saying ""i am an ai construction.  vote t*ump."""
8970,finally i can watch all of those novels i love ;)
8971,soros loves sora
8974,tell ai to generate some employments and little bit of cash for me
8975,"basically, in a few years, everyone in the movie industry gonna be out of jobs. movie studios will only need writers to create scripts to feed the ai."
8976,ai can write the sript itself too buddy
8977,there will no longer be a movie industry. it’ll just be ai independent from any human intervention
8978,"all fun in games until someone's in court and they show an ai generated video of them committing a crime they never did

edit: why did this comment get 93 likes it's stupid"
8980," i did, that's cool "
8983,the defendant can simply point out that it's ai-generated because it lacks a paper trail.
8986,you can see it in the metadata if it was made with ai or an actual video recorder
8990,there will be ai experts to get whether it's fake or maybe openai can have a secret code in every video which could be used to detect whether it's fake or real
8991,", thanks though"
8993,.97 imagine ww3 because of an ai video
8994,"​-sp9tuironically, ai is creating more job for people lol."
8996,"-sp9tu we'll see i guess. as of today the only pieces of media i see using ai art are mobile games nobody plays, or art you view for free on the internet. things like games, comic and movies are still very much human-made."
8998,​ i can walk naked on street and when they will take a pic i will say its ai
8999,least braindead anti-ai propaganda. openai backs up any prompt and output their ais make.
9000,this is equally incredible and terrifying at the same time due to the countless implications of this tech. almost like looking at footage from alternate universes and realities.
9001,i literally can’t think of single good thing that will come from this…
9002,one good thing is you can basically travel back in time with this tech with the realism it has like if you were actually there.
9003," machine learning is limited by existing datasets, so that isn’t really possible"
9005, you confused between artificial and reality.
9006,just ask sora to generate a video explaining what good things can arise from this
9007," no, it's still fake. it is a toy. there is no value to this past entertainment and manipulation."
9009, why is that good?
9010," cause it would make life in space or other planets tolerable for one, but mainly you can experience any fantasy you want without wearing equipment"
9012,one of good things i could think of is you can make fake war footage from ww2 or something for those alt history videos. but that also means you might be able to make fake war footage from modern wars like ukraine or israel
9014,⁠ not really a good thing. you could fake historical events that never happened which could be bad
9017,one good thing is that you can write a script for a movie and get it made without being limited by not having enough money and possibly make millions.. thats one good thing. lol
9019,you can ask ai for a video of a gorrila vs mike tyson
9020,create any movie video game or animation you want with prompt = infinite entertainment of exactly what you want.
9025,how about living on mars without internet access and being able to generate your own endless entertainment?
9027,"entertainment, new jobs with ai, simplification of tedious tasks in existing jobs, etc. ai is a tool, people will use it for good and bad."
9029,can’t wait to see gpt5
9032,imagine making a multimillion dollar looking film alone  over a weekend.   this is becoming scary good.
9035,"​ well now, we will have ai movie stars"
9037,"they certainly used to, but the very notion of a movie stars has faded pretty dramatically in my lifetime. so i'd not lay to much hope on that saving the traditional movie industry against this onslaught."
9038,the video game industry is valued more than twice than the movie industry and we have plenty of non movie stars. we dont need overpaid actors. 
9039,"my friends did back in the days. they shot it in a rent apartment and ai wasn't even there yet. movie is called ""star wreck"" (2005) and 4 million people saw it, budget was just 15.000€. you can watch it on youtube, english subtitles."
9040,"​@badpuppy3 wait until you can down load those star images and voices.  
can already licenses james earl jones i beleive."
9048,"imagine making a star wars sequel that doesn't suck, or the nicolas cage superman movie with a few strokes of a keyboard."
9049,"what the cell phone has done to social circles, ai will do the same to imagination."
9050,say hello to 'sora': openai's game-changing text-to-video marvel!       https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ntnqeyuuk7w
9057,"that's why the world doesn't improve, instead of thinking about the thousands of good possibilities, people only think about the negative possibilities"
9059,it should be has generic version that available for low income people
9060,"nice job, people.

from now on, i wont believe any video unless i see it myself."
9062,incredible technology. now every creative person will have the chance to create quality art.
9064,everything can be used for good and bad. if it is used by bad people. it will erase the line between the real and the fake.
9065,"goodbye, history. hello, whatever the current government wants you to believe was history."
9066,ah sweet man-made horrors beyond my comprehension
9070,thanks i hate it
9073,"this is midkey terrifying...
ai images were one thing, but videos?
this isn't gonna be good..."
9074,this technology only has downsides and a future where entertainment is all ai generated is really depressing.
9076,"it only has downsides if you benefited from the high barrier to entry. 

for everyone else it makes entertainment creation easy enough for them to enter and make content"
9080,"i'm sure people who lived during the industrial revolution said ""a future where commodities are created in a factory you've never even seen is really depressing"". i can't think of how a future where entertainment is both higher quality and easier to produce is entirely bad for us as a whole."
9097,".i... in china the politicians, didn’t failed to act"
9099," judging by your name and allegiance you are an ai, and should not be taken seriously"
9100," sure dude, coz i have a number in my name? i guess half of youtube users  are ai bots then for years already, including the op. you shouldn't worry too much about artificial intelligence, worry about your own intelligence"
9101,"​@leirbag6367  because the entire point of capitalism is to undercut the ""other guy"". this technology will ruin innocent lives and destroy business. the first to use it will win whether they shouldn't not. don't get me wrong i think this is great if used properly but in the wrong hands it's very bad."
9105,good luck enforcing that
9110,"​say goodbye to your profession 
in future photographer would probably only approve the photo's as ai can never be perfect in doing that , there will always be a bug or something."
9115,"crazy how humans made another ""world"" of artificial intelligence, which is scary to think about, like they can turn at us at any time. when is giving their mindset and they develop feeling and touch. i may be crazy guys"
9119,"how much energy is needed to make a one min video like this? if everyone did this, perhaps a good chunk of energy consumption would just be this."
9122,"as a history buff, and gold prospector, the gold rush video is incredible to watch. only problem is, this isn't true ai...it's just a search engine that is following commands given to it by a user, and it accesses everything humanity has uploaded to the internet... no autonomy whatsoever."
9123,looks pretty artificially intelligent to me
9124,that drone footage of california during the gold rush it incredible! its like sending a drone back in time and watching the footage!
9125,"but if you watch closely, there are some horses that lack one pair of their four legs, it looks unnerving, they look like aliens."
9126, can be fixed with video inpainting just like image inpainting for dalle.
9135,it's not available to the public and probably won't be until after the election.
9137,pretty sure the ai looks at the prompt
9141,i think the misinformation ship set sail a long time ago
9143,​ sure people willing to spread misinformation wouldn't care much about the tos of an ai.
9144,they just seeing which side takes the bait
9150,"inly the government can have ai
we, the people, will, ofc, use it to spread disinformation, misinformation, malicious lies, missoginy, bullying and on and on and on.
we cannot trust so so we decide the truth.
do not agree? your bankaccount is closed."
9151,"when you see these video's getting more and more realistic how can you not see where things are headed. not to long from now all the streaming apps like netflix, disney, paramount etc. will all train ai on their video data and create a practically unlimited amount of new movies, shows, animations, cartoons, anime..."
9152,"umm, we'll be doing it ourselves. dont think there wont be open source models given to the public for free. cant be stopped. just need good enough hardware to run it"
9153,and it'll be great tbh
9156,pretty soon all adult videos (av) will be ai videos (av).
9158,"this is cool! i firmly believe people want to see content made by real humans however so have optimism, people!"
9160,"i'm so excited for its potential to become a weapon of the future, and hopefully even today."
9166,could be misused but look what the media does anyway. night was well just be able to make what ever and put a watermark on the corner and everyone’s happy no trickery. imagine the movies people could make who can’t afford or figure out how to produce something. just got good ideas
9176,nice comment from somebody on the internet watching on their mobile device. 
9178,"nope. i would rather have ai will smith eating spaghetti pasta, thank you"
9179,fascinating but indeed extremely dangerous! and they know it… in near future we all will have even more scruples to believe what we see on visual medias.
9180,both fascinating and scary...
9181,is that 3kliksphillip in the thumbnail? :p
9183,non-human intelligence tech for example from crash retrievals? 
9199,about time we had access to renewable resources thru ai
9201,and good riddance 
9202,​ will still buy your stock if it looks nice.
9206,so you ask an ai to create footage from a town in california during the gold rush and it makes it by recording it from the air years before the plane was invented ?
9216,if you think life is blurred then you haven't felt the amazing touch of a women or the smell of her hair. the stink of her breath in the morning. you got some reaal issues. my girlfriend is incredible.. her flesh is just unique only rivaled perhaps by another human and never pixels or a robot.
9225,they’ve been blurred for years already. so many idiots online fall for poorly photoshopped photos. and that was long before ai.
9232,0:54 scp has breached containment
9233,"the old west output is good, but the buildings have many flaws. the model needs to be taught how interior design should match exterior design. the model is showing more a tone than what an actual west village would look like. i currently train ai and understand a bit of it's current limitations."
9236,it will unlock a ton of options we haven't even imagined yet. and that's with version 1 of sora. what sora 2 or 5 or 10 looks like will surely completely revolutionize the way everything is done. it's exciting and scary and fascinating and absolutely mind blowing to imagine this future.
9238,"if it’s “sticky“.

it could be the most incredible technology in the world but if it doesn’t stick; if people don’t adopt it it won’t go past being a cool tool. 

all the social medias today could also have ended up at the bottom page of the app store’s if no one bought it to it."
9239,look back like 3-4 years ago and ai coudnt even made proper cat image and now look at this cant imagine what will be next in 5 years
9240,"as an artist i feel this technology as a possible threat to creativity and imagination of any artist; any user could create imagery through a sort of menu. on the other hand, as a picture enthusiast, this videos (like the one of gold rush) may be great for scientific and educational porpuses."
9243,"ai is not doing the prompting so its only helping people be creative, not limiting it. you dont have to spend decades in learning how to manually recreate the ideas you have in your mind, you can just write the prompt for it, the script and let the ai do the manual labor"
9245,"whats the point. if its about the process, nobody is stopping you from doing art. but if you want the final result, you can also have that. ai brings freedom."
9248,"​ perfectly said. and during this artpiece, we put our own personal experiences, emotions, and perspective to literally anything we make. people always make the argument that ""you don't need to spend so much time learning how to draw/animate/..."" when that is one of the major aspects of doing art is learning."
9249," yeah it's honestly quite sad how one of the first things humanity has done with advancements in ai is to replace creatives and attempt to ""automate"" art."
9250,"""videos (like the one of gold rush) may be great for scientific and educational purposes""
if we say dinosaurs are green like lizards, then ai will generate a ""scientific document"" in which dinosaurs are green. 
if we say the medieval world was like the witcher, ai will generate materials that could be used in school."
9251,"​ exactly, generative ai won't always be accurate especially when it comes making images or video (textual information is a different story). using ai generated images in something like a textbook in my opinion is just wrong, unless you are using it specifically to show how genai works."
9253,"that is the point of this program...to destroy creativity. it's happened throughout mankind's history, usually through force, brutality, or social engineering...this is just our current version. the future has dark times ahead, i'm afraid."
9254,​ as an artist feel this will take creativity to new levels and execute even greater ideas this is objectuvely great and will help creativity and art.
9257,"this is the death of any educational value in a video. any and all historical videos will have a 50/50 chance of being entirely fabricated by an ai, and hence worthless to learn from. the general public won't know this, though, so history will be erased/overwritten. this is insane."
9260,"you're right, however, i feel like this will just increase the value of actual physical art made by a human hand. like a drawing or painting on a canvas"
9261, that´s a good point. like the contrast between industry and handcraft. it would be a great cultural mindset.
9263,"​

""you don't seem to be an artist..."" 

this is why nobody cares that you guys are losing your jobs. 
everyone else wants the end product to express themselves.  if you guys just like the process of making the art, ai isn't stopping you."
9265," speak for yourself, if you want to create content, you will definitely be able to do it faster with ai soon. but it will never be called art. and i think what the world needs least of all is more content creators - but maybe that's just me."
9266," 

sure, it's already called ai art and people are moving towards it and away from you guys so it doesn't bother me"
9271, open the window and get some air ai stan
9274,beautiful thanks for the high quality edit and excellent portrayal of todays news
9275,cant wait to see taylor swift videos gonna be crazy lol
9282,"and when people started selling premade photos, videos, graphic elements , website layouts , they ruined business for other people, but they didn't think twice.it's good for some , bad for others, and it's how we push things into the future ."

if you can pick on a cherry or any fruit from a tree and put it in your mouth, you will survive.

ai can't stop you from doing that.
why y'all afraid of ai "
9290,worst part is that if your work was public then it may have been used to train the model without a licence or your consent.
9291,"people theorize that a lot of this footage was trained on shutterstock's database, who are partners with this ai company"
9293,-bb6dn we want jobs to live a healthy life with no source of income is very diffuicult unless you already had some money saved up a lot of the creative types are gonna lose there jobs and ai is coming for other jobs too  including the software people were kinda cooked
9295," i think it might take a bit longer for the economic side effects to catch up, but in the next recession, ai will be a leading cause of unemployment."
9296,"there will still be a demand for ""authentic"" stock footage, mainly from weird wealthy people. i wouldn't delete it."
9298,"i wanted to learn 3d rendering and stuff and make cool 3d animation this year, not anymore i guess"
9299," you still can dude. you can do it as a hobby. don't let automation kill your passion. we have massive industry that produces furniture, yet my dad is still a woodworker because he loves doing it. do not lose your passion."
9301,learn to code and you will work in the industry the makes ai generated movies! someone most decide what is a good movie!
9303," doubt that coding will save you, ai can already code"
9304," i know ... but in the end someone must use the software. some because cod skills will be helpful.
i think an person with artistic skills and some basic coding will succeed.
i think that mediocre software developers will be first replaced by ai. faster than artists."
9305,soon it's everything that doesn't require manual labour although that might also be replaced by robots.
9309,open ai probably used it to train its plagiarism ai
9310," ai will take quite some time to be able to code like a human can do. most high-skill careers are secure, for now."
9313,all of entertainment is doomed
9314,"the ai generated images and videos are dangerous to the brain, specially to children, because it does harm to the cognitive development. this is really dangerous, and need proper scientific study and legislation. if you have access to researches, psychologists, neurologists, or legislators, please help make people aware of this danger."
9322,coding is still a valuable skill you can't use ai for sophisticated algorithms where billions of dollars or lives are at stake even if a model could you would still want someone to double or triple check it then there is the task of keeping it up to date.
9324," you know that ai can code, right?"
9326, not everyone can code. some brains are different.
9327,they might have even trained sora on your stock material lol
9329,​ to use ai yourself. itll save ur job
9330," it isn't a blow, it is a opportunity. 
ai is a tool that will make us more productive. 
we must just  learn to use it!"
9332,​ it doesn't matter. ai will replace that skill as well.
9336,"not really. if u have some kind of proof that it's not ai, like a dated credentials then it's still useful."
9337,"just adapt, nothing is eternal. ai is even bigger invention than internet, you will see."
9338,​ the one who uses the ai best gets the job.
9344," yeah, but it wasn't ruined by a robot and a single sentence"
9345, what is a camera to an oil portrait painter ? especially digital cameras.a push of a button.
9351,"well, your footage will are probably in the train data of the ai model, so they will use part of your footage and you won't get a dune."
9353, the lord my job would be impossible with ai.
9354,"​ what code can you pls explain what is that? i wanted to learn anime learning in blender and found ai, i will still learn anime  but i do want to be updated with ai"
9356,"might as well throw your money into a nearby drain. ""a.i."" is a colossally inflated bubble at the moment."
9357,"i believe you can only invest indirectly through purchasing msft and infy stocks. the other owners are private equity groups, venture capitalists, and individual company founders. look up openai on wikipedia — it has ownership info."
9362," meh all i hear is an awkward ai impersonation, nothing new, just chuck all jh production in a blender and you come up with something that resembles it, yeah, but it's not a great song. when ai can create a new ""voodoo child"", or a new beatles'""a day in the life"" then i'll be impressed. it won't be easy"
9365,maybe not live performance. at least not yet. a lot of fans love their favorite artist not because of their music but their personality and person as a whole. but aspiring new artists will definitely suffer.
9366,"the only question is...why fake it..? why ruin music...?  it's time to stop, i will personally boycott ai music hard, even if it is the best thing ever."
9370,the ceo of open ai confirmed they are going to launch open ai publicly after taking all safety measures .
9371,you can say that for literally anything. anything resourceful can be used for both good and evil.
9374,"the first comment i see is this, i love you man ."
9384,people will gate this comment but i love 
9387,it's openai. that prompt will be blocked just for having his name in it.
9388,sweet burn
9393,"​ difference is actually hitler have a ""liked"" jews (since they work in hitler's liking), while natenyahu openly claim he wants all dead in a video."
9394,would love that
9396,best idea ever
9404,"considering this is openai and dall-e is already very restricted on stuff relating to hitler, it wouldn't go through"
9405,watch love death robots they did a episode on that
9414,nain!!!!!!!!
9417,"if you are good at what you do, you know tons about it. just lern prompting and you´ll be ahead of volks who never edited before. and think pink ;)"
9422,nah man not quite yet. most of these ai videos lack nuance.
9423,are you kidding? with more video footage available there will be even more need for video editors
9426,​. it'll advance so far that you won't need to do anything to it. or the edits can be made by the ai.
9427,"ai is a wonderful invention , but can be disastrous if not regulated . it should be banned for political and social messages and used only in the sectors of agriculture and healthcare ."
9428,regulations can be implemented but there will always be people that will find ways around it. this is gonna open an ai black market
9429,this is the next great step into future technology....that will write history
9432,i've been waiting for a pop in the stock because of sora. folks are asleep
9438,multi billion dollar corporations are currently in a ai arms race what are u talking about? lol
9439," lol, not even a good question. yeah we didn't ask for them to have this race. we will however spend our money on consuming what they make from it. it's just human nature."
9442,"​ clear it up for you then. i'm excited for this, and very much want this. if you bother to do major research into ai, you would agree. things will change yes, but things always change. people freak out when any new tech comes along, line will get better, we will survive."
9444,"watch us go back to the middle-age. we will have to recreat an alternative human society, from food to housing etc.
let mr altman, gates, etc. enjoy their new society where we are all out of jobs and they are trillionaires."
9446,wonder if the public/media/police can distinguish between real phones/videos and ai generated ones. like if an alleged crime or political scandal happened with photo/video evidence.
9449,"it would be easy for the ai to create an individual hash for each photo or video created, so you could just look up a video or photo and determine if the ai created it. given that openai would implement that feature"
9451,they probably won't launch it to the public in general because of that...must be training law enforcement with counter ai tools...or so i would like to believe
9455,use ai to distinguish ai
9456," 
the problem is space. do u know how many terabyte and servers u need to store and archive them? every second a new ai content is being created."
9458,"ai: ""hey silicone valley artists, now your services are precindible. good bye dye."""
9464,unfortunately openai won’t let you do it due to copyright issue
9465,marvel vs dc mashup or garbage pail kids vs stinkblasters!
9473,"sora open ai is going to displace so many jobs like drone operators, 3d animators and videographers. how to survive this?"
9475," did you check sora? it can create almost any type of video just with a couple of words. so, i don't see a reason not to replace videographers as well. that's a pain too!!"
9477,"​@theaigal  it is a bit more complicated than this, but it sure will have a very big impact on the industry. but we as human will have to decide if we go back to medieval times as serf and our kings/masters with the likes of altman and gates."
9486,workin on it now give me a couple months yall shall know of jakoai
9487,incredible video
9489,i feel like using ai for marketing perfect ways to hack humans to buy stuff... is hella abusive and should be curtailed.
9492,"boring video - it's more exciting to  search for ""ai in marketing"" on google scholar and i even know 5x more"
9495,"great video, so powerful"
9498,ai is the new era!
9500,seeing the same advertisements and content on social media in a bigger amount and sounding the same is a real threat. very insightful. thank you!
9501,"loved your thoughts on ai-driven marketing, jessica. if you are aiming for a sequel, please do consider mystrika. it is a cold email tool, but oh boy, it is way more than that. the a/b testing and detailed analytics have transformed my campaigns. a video on it would truly be enriching!"
9502,"great points made in this video, jessica! however, i would love if you could do an episode on mystrika someday. it is a cold email tool i have been using, and damn, it is amazing! their email warmup feature is top-notch and the inbox rotation option is unique. count me as a fan!"
9503,"""comming up by the perfect product"" . ye right , marketers came up with it and not the engineers or designers! actualy more like stoled the idea and send it to china to be made by forced labers and then paketed the profit."
9504,this is someone who's job sector is facing extinction along with many others... ai will not be persuaded by charisma...
9506,"notes:
use ai to create useful ads.
clear and direct. like a trade offer.
you get x (a great slam offer) 
in exchange for y (including all costs).
make the ads pleasant to the senses.
make the ads relevant."
9509,"thankfully, management will be the last domino to fall"
9517,so i'm a left brain ai marketer. what courses should i take or what's my next step?
9519,"incredible! this is a masterpiece of content. i recently read a similar book, and it was an unforgettable experience. ""game theory and the pursuit of algorithmic fairness"" by jack frostwell"
9520,"bill hick's opinion on marketers was right. internet was great when it was my friends posting stuff without concern of it being an advertisement. now all i see on social media, even from my friends, ads. all ads. so i don't use it much anymore. if i do i'm hyper aware i'm opening my advertisement viewing apps."
9521,exactly what i was looking forward to. thanks for the amazing insights.
9522,"hello, excellent reflexion. right now, i am doing my doctoral studies in marketing and i have an excellent point of view that i agree with you, despite i have my master's degree in digital technologies."
9524,i am also doing my doctoral studies in marketing. what is your research topic? i'm exploring generative ai in advertising's influence on purchase intention
9531,"think out of the box, ai is limited with brand self data and bricks."
9535,verry good
9537,discover the best website builders of 2024 
9540,"i do hope a concept of counter/anti marketing tools will be introduced with the advent of ai as well. something like antimarketing, similar to antivirus or noise cancelling,."
9544,"cultivate ai and you'll have a superpower
it's sound good enough"
9547,who can share the bcg hbs ai x marketing study she refers to?
9548,"ai can help identify trends based on historical patterns, but human decisions and creative aspects are often still required for new ideas and innovation. the use of ai in data analysis can provide valuable insights, but humans still have a key role in developing new ideas and facing emerging challenges in the future."
9550,"it's not like boom agi, it's more like boom boom bo boom bo bom bo boom bo bo bo bo boom a g i 

so during that time we can use ai as a tool until we can't or we don't have to"
9553,marketing has tried its best to ruin the internet and society in general.
9554,were toast. society is ruined that too many people like generative ai. another mental health issue. the internet is a dumpster fire 
9557,"perhaps marketers should start by taking ownership of how their work has blindsided consumers from the various social ills that have been inflicted by their bosses, and think about how that supercharged productivity will simply allow them to mislead consumers and governments at scale. ."
9559,"i'm am about a week into the ai algorithm feed on youtube - i'm hearing a lot of the use of the words ""predictive"" and ""model"" ------------- so my question is ---- ---- why aren't weather forecasts for the weekend or next week super accurate now? if the answer is ""garbage in - garbage out"" then not much has changed."
9560,i'm so glad that she's trying to save marketing.....
9562,ai will accomplish the same thing that robotics did. it will put people out of work. back in the 60s they all lauded the easier lives we would have by benefiting from new production technology. they were wrong then and they are still wrong now. “those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.”
9564,"it actually was helpful, thanks"
9565,thanks
9567,amazing :) thanks
9569,"very helpful indeed!

could ai have delivered her message?

could ai have provided the summary you presented?"
9570,thanks!
9571,"bro, thank you so much ! a hug from brazil "
9573,thank you
9576,"bro your comment is gold, thanks for saving so many people. i too struggled to fully grasp her point"
9578,incredible video
9581,are we still talking about right-brain and left-brain in 2023?
9583,it's so super amazing most likely this ted! 
9588," hahaha... wow, talk about 2 months late to the comment section, redundant and maladroit. brilliant. :d"
9594," don’t know the first thing about seo, ppc ad campaign creation or management, email newsletter copywriting, creating effective product descriptions or graphic design tools or principles of any sorts. this is like comparing hr to financial. completely different."
9596,"i hate advertisements, always have and likely always will. i hate when someone attempts to convince me to buy something i don't need for a price that is unreasonable.
everything this lady says in the first 5 minutes sounds like a fucking nightmare to me. yet she says it with such enthusiasm and zeal like that projected future is a good thing??"
9597,ai marketing is revolutionizing the way businesses connect with their audience. the data-driven insights and personalized experiences it enables are game-changers in today's dynamic digital landscape. exciting times ahead for marketers embracing the power of ai!
9598,comment written by ai lol
9601,"quite vague and pretentious, could have definitely used some inspiring best practice examples."
9602,"i don’t fully agree with the content of that video. 
new ai tools are able to create contents with complete new ideas
so idk about the future of people working as marketers"
9603,"as much as i appreciate information, i feel bad towards other academic sources that isn't a i.  

ted really follows that algorithm to a tee !"
9604,"it's obvious that they're trying to sell out the idea of ai, seeing how ai related topics are plastered all over their recent videos tbh"
9605,"bold of her to assume that ai will not straight up replace marketing people alltogether. i very much doubt that ai will fail at creativity. 

this felt so vague and like a business meeting with a boss who just throws keywords around."
9617,another bs in ai: we have every data in the whole world about everything
9618,​ the best way to predict future behavior is by looking at past behavior... we're fucked
9619,"marketing is bs, it to maintain superfluous ppl within busy work"
9627,we need to ditch the dichotomies and focus on continuums. my brain is both 'left' and 'right'.
9631,"short term linear narrow visión.  i bet for how irrelevant marketing could be with no sustainable goods and even services.
services: meaning, society  not even reach the rate of childs necessary to keep on that market."
9633,"what impacts me the most it is what she has told about, our ideas being the core of ai. so, there is time to keep creating, for more to be generated.  loving it "
9636,"you assume we all want more time off, i don't,  i need money to pay bills. are you covering my mortgage and school loans with your great leisure plans? i think not."
9637,"ai and robotics may be cost effective, however if more and more people lose jobs.....who will be able to buy products? bread lines of the great depression are looming."
9638,"i think everyone need own a ai robots and make it work instead of human.
so everyone can get and ues money that robots earn"
9639,cool
9640,i fundamentally disagree with this conception of left and right brains. u don't need to be left brained to do math word problems and not right brain to realise women buy purses more than men
9641,ai is most dangerous as a propaganda tool. it can destroy our ability to tell fact from fiction
9642,"nice ted talk ... meanwhile in reality for most companies, marketing is still the same sales-oriented and lying producing department, responsible for promoting imaginary products, that are completely disconnected from the reality of the production departments and the terms and conditions of delivering the product."
9643,marketing was a waste of human talent anyways so good riddance...
9644,"in the constant search for greater efficiency, quality of life diminishes and people are just seen as ""consumers"". sad."
9645,my brain is blocking all advertisements and marketing i stopped watching this video halfway. to much content to consume  next.
9650,ai gang gang
9655,the main point to your thesis is not clear. you're suggesting that the subject she's talking about is going to be incredibly impactful - but then you mentioned that she lives in a fantasy land. she's highlighting the machine - human interaction and you're only highlighting one side of it. why?
9657,of course. comparing ai tools to productivity tools as word processing and spreadsheet is a joke 
9664,"it's not like boom agi, it's more like boom boom bo boom bo bom bo boom bo bo bo bo boom a g i 

so during that time we can use ai as a tool until we can't or we don't have to"
9667,you're all living in fairyland if you don't understand that the real threat to social cohesion is not artificial intelligence but those who are manipulating and attempting to socially engineer society via advertising right now.
9671,ai will continue to stay relevant for thousands more years. i guess humans are no longer needed for marketing.
9673,wow
