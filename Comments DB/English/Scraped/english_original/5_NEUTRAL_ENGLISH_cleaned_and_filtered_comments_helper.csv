1457,sir we need more episode of ai 
1458,but..... i feel ki...  ai kbi bhi emotional ya public relation nhi kr sakta
1459,"best lines 

artificial intelligence can think and react on the basis of input, but it can't be conscious minus the input or the output.

humans can exist, not just exist. humans can come upon something that is untouchable by a thought; all the problem create by thought.

how  can we stop to ai to involve our life and thought"
1503,agar ai aggressive ho jaye to
1504,"i would like to question some of the statements. if the natural world can produce humans capable of self realization, in principle any other properly arranged configuration should be able to do the same, right? as such, why can't the future forms of ""ai"" be capable of experiencing the world? is the statement limited to the current forms of ai?"
1505,"faltu ki batein hai sab..... human should, always be there to operate the ai, command basis pr work krta hai, it's not concious thing.

2326,"but ai is make by humans, if it can affect the survival of human  then human can destroy ai in future."
2329,the basic question is - how anyone can earn his/her bread in the ai era. which is not far. maybe another couple of years only.
2332,"fantastic sir...
 i think the difference between ai and human intelligence is we hav emotions and ai doesn't have...
ai can't love,hate,sympathy etc..."
2333,"learnings from the video -
• in the future, we'll be completely dependent on ai. it will be the cause of our problems and at the same time it will give us the solution.
• ai and human intelligence can't exist without inputs.
• human can exist without thinking and can be conscious but ai can't."
2338,but all the ai is invented just because of man... then how can it be better than man...? if man stops working on  ai  then ai can't spread its capacity itself ...
2339,just wait few years ai replace humans 
2340,gadh.e.    ban hi solution hai
2343,"every word of this video is more than enough to understand the difference, between human mind and ai. ai is not something new for us, this all started many years ago and this is our future so we must be ready to face it on bigger level. the level, where people will be adding ai cheep in their brain to survive in this world."

2358,sandeep sir k talking style mai dam hai... jisse hame bhi bahoot sikhne ko milta hai 
2362,better to know yourself before 'ai' know about youi
2364,yes sir ai do not have emotions so that it can't understand intentions of an order with compared to human ?
2365,"sir, so by this video what do you want to tell, the difference ?? the difference that you told was like very impractical, this thing is only achieved by great spiritual personalities, what  is the benefit of this when you are in thought less state, no desires, no feelings, nothing to do........ ofirst video of yours i found pointless......"

3092,very powerful information i 
3093,"after some years who want to know about artificial intelligence (ai) the ai share this video to them.  

ai भी एक सीमित क्षेत्र तक ही ठीक है। क्योंकि ये आविष्कार अभी तक वरदान साबित हो सकता है लेकिन कुछ समय बाद एक अधिकता के बाद ये मानव जीवन के लिए अभिशाप साबित होगा।

3116,ai mas******tervate nahi kar sakta  vo sirf human kar sakta h
3119,sir artificial intelligence thinking nahi kar sata hai
3120,"ai is limited because how much information it has , it is still limited. it is still dependent on given info.human horizon of thinking is broader if it works efficiently. human can think out of box . ai  cannot produce art and literature because it is based on info."
3122,"man can thinks more than machine. machine can not thinks more than humans
history is evidence
ai created by human."
3123,ai cannot beat me in ludo
3124,"i am not agree...ai can help us like to find which route is best to travel now..small psychological issues seems these all are temporary issues...but it can't fix problems like poverty...health  those are very deep rooted, hard,, like understanding our universe."

3144,ai couldn't move fingers and body like sandeep maheshwari 
3145,"i don't agree on point where sandeep sir said ai can't understand thoughtless state, i think at some point  evolving ai will reach singularity wherein it will submerge into the infinite, hence i think there will be no difference between god ( god being state of infinity and source of energy which is omnipotent ) and ai."
3147,"ai can not build relations because relations are based on emotions and feeling. ai can only capture what emotions are required but to express need humans. building communities, relationships."
3149,omg all clear sir thank you so much sandeep sir 
3150,thanks for knowledge sir
3151,artificial intelligence kabhi bhi poti nahi kar sakta

3165,"“human has created ai”
so,if a human can create such extraordinary intellegnce it shows that human has something inherit that ai has not.
hope u understand."
3166,ai kabhi bhi good bad imotion ko kabhi nhi feel kar sakta hai kyoki vo pain happy kya hai es base par ham good bad samjhate vaise ai nhi sajh kar sakta
3167,artificial intelligence kabhi bhi hag (latring ) nahi kar sakta 
3168,can ai sing song with melodious voice?
3169,ai chahe kuch bhi karle..jab meri aai ko gussa ayega toh jhaadu belan lekar usko peet peet kar seedha kar degi
3170,ai kabhi bhi human ki jagah nahi le sakta... i mean ultimately ye human control mein hi rahega...

3195,"सब से अच्छा मुझे ये लगा, आप ने आज भी सच भी बोला, आने वाले कल को नहीं बदला जा सकता, ai काल आएगा ही, वास्तविक खुद को यानी सत्य को समझ लेना ही एक समझदारी है.."
3196,isko nast karna jaruri hai
3198,summary- only humans can find way to param atma......and when you reach the state of everything you will become nothing and everyone will see their own reflection (ai as well)...then you will decide what you want ai to take as an input...
3199,"al is future and inevitable. it will come in future but related to job perspective one job will remain the same peak but not for all time... the job is data scientist and ai trainer...
but in future ai will train himself with the help of himself."
3200,but ai ke pas emotions nahi he to human emotions ko change kase kar sakta he?? ha ai pe hadse jada dependent nahi hona chahiya..

how are you planning to deal with photos generating ais and your company sir?
though there are certain limitations now like creating perfect hands, it will get through it in the future."
3543,"the biggest difference between ai and human intelligence is that human intelligence is based on consciousness, subjective experience, and self-awareness, while ai is a programmed algorithmic approach to problem-solving. human intelligence also has a level of creativity, intuition, and emotion that ai currently lacks."

3593,"ai
sounds good that's it..

4089,ai cannot become a good friend..
4092,sir ai cant dream because it do not have emotions
4094,ai is very small thing. nowadays most people can't think beyond money. if we think consciously we'l find our all thought money oriented. ai is also that. human  never can be compared with machine 
4096,kya ai shree krishna ji ki tarah soch aur future predicted hai phele se usse hone se phele hi change kar sakta hai? jaise unhone mahabharat me kiya tha
4097,jab ham ai ko bana sakte hai to ai ko controll bhi kar sakte hai. ai kabhi bhi human brain se bada nahi ho sakta. agar ho to samzna usi din dub gayi duniya
4098,but robot mein creativity nahin hota hai 
4101,ai can't feel good or bad by itself.

4123,sir agar bade bade at least 5 ya 6 engineers jo ai ke field ke hai unse agar merits ya demerits ke baare me puchha jaye to vo sahi se answer kar payenge ai ke baare me. aam adami  sahi se answer nahi kar payenge. aap un bade bade engineers se debates kare to jyada achha rahega.
4125,सर इंसान को भगवान ने बनाया है तो कोई इंसान भगवान से ऊपर नहीं गया तो ai को तो इंसान ने बनाया है तो ai इंसान से ऊपर नहीं जा सकती हैं।

4130,this is real brainstorming
4132,"sandip bhai, ai human brainse aage kabhi bhi aage nahi ja sakta. q ki ai ka jo designing ya model bana hai, ya aage banega, wo human brainse hi hoga. q ki human brain me anginat programming ho sakta jo duniya ke kisi bhi ai software nahi hai. aap ek bar human brain ka study kijiye."
4133,natural  ke barbar artificialal   kabi nhi kar sakta hai
4136,4:40 sir ai agar psychology treatment krega to vo jholchap doctor jaisa hi krwa payega bcz har kisi ki body same nahi hoti yahan ai fail kr jayega...6:33 pr ai questions krega par jo banda depression me ho ya koi psychological disorder se pass ho rha vo ans nahi krega vo keval psychologist hi smjh payega
