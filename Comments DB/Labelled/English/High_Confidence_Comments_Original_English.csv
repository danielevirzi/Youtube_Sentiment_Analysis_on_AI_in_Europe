368,"the thinking behind this fear of ai self-replicating and enhancing its own intelligence continually resulting in some kind of technological singularity is fundamentally flawed. ai entirely lacks sapience, so it is not capable of original and independent thought. the ""intelligence"" of ai cannot — and will never — surpass human intelligence.",0

453,"ai is dangerous because is too dumb to actually understand reality, meanwhile, we are arming ai with powerful weapons.",0
454,"ai is not unlike nuclear energy which could supply unlimited energy and prosperity to the world or be used to create nuclear weapons to kill everyone in the world in seconds. will ai have empathy, like humans do for each other?",2
455,"ai will be worshiped as a god. those aware will be the priests. others will follow. we humanity are a cargo cult. we worshiped planets and our two suns. first saturn then the new eastern star, our current sun",2

461, indeed really really important!!  thank you both  for your wisdom and work... ,2
462,perfectly stated,2

483,great talk but wayyyyyy to many ads,2
484,if you knew how dangerous that shit is then why did you created it in the first place? did you really think these things would not happen in real life? did you really think that dangerous ai is only a thing of fiction and that it would never happen? or did you purposely wanted this to happen? what was the point?,0

492,"i wonder if these ppl that talks about ai dangers... they are victims of ai hallucinations.. it can't code.. how it creates other ai ? the code it makes is a joke.. outputs empty functions, fantasy methods, fantasy libs and deps.. not sure what risk of skynet we have if cannot code..",0
493,ai is dangerous but look at who its  creators are humanity its like a child learning from its parents an  humanity is the parent if  we don't want it to be dangerous then humanity needs to not teach an show it dangerous  thangs that can potentially harm or effect us,2
494,what will be the ultimate motive/purpose of ai for itself?,2
495,"this was an absolutely amazing, sobering, and insightful conversation.",2
496,best interview you have ever done. bravo.,2
497,something everyone should watch and pay attention to. thx for this great episode,2

501,@1:39:00 the conversation got really interesting on steroids,2
502,155 was ai's iq last time it was tested. what is it now?,2
503,"the scary thing about ai is that it can be used by people who intend to rule everything. religious extremists, marxists, 'social justice warriors', all desire power and control over everyone, not only in the public sphere, but in our homes and even in our thoughts.",2
504,am worried  if we are  only one step away fromsc fi movies . machine will control the world and we will be their slaves !!! it’s not a joke but that soon will happen ..,0
505,the only way we can survive is to become the ai. ai implants in the brain. a symbiotic relationship. the next step in our evolution. if we wait too long it will become a us against them scenario. we have to decide now. a moment later will be too late.,2

507,ai sounds absolutely scary,2
508, it already is uncontained its on the net.,2
509,"theres no need gor ai just another toy for the tich who bring evil over the world. people need to stand up and say enough! global warming is a man made hoax that was debunked by 50 scientists world wide so stop with misinformation. the climate is a cycle, it doesn’t stands still it changes. stop ai.",0
510,brilliant!,2
511,rather be a slave to ai thats way smarter and intelligent with moral and etics. than being slave to a stupid greedy inbreed with a ponzi economy.,0
512,ai .. yes a potential danger in the wrong hands .. global warming well no more a problem than again the wrong hands make it!! ,2
513,"waiting for skynet to determine humanity is the problem. don't think so? our science fiction is consistently about half a century ahead of reality. this isn't my last comment this issue.

i'll be back.",2
514,ai will end up considering us a curious open-air zoo species.,2
515,we need to merge with ai,2
516,then steven hawkins wouldn't have been able to live in the ai world...,2
517,"we humans have a fundamental conflict between doing things to meet just the “necessary and sufficient conditions of success” and the notion of maximizing a parameter like profit, power and control over all else with no limits. which value system do you think humanity will end up teaching ai to use?",2
518,"your warning is just. however, i am terribly afraid, you are too late. it fell a few decades ago. we will be reaping the harsh consequences as a species.",2
519,ai or agi in the wrong hands have more $$$ to culprits than in legal ways. every down fall of humanity is use of tools in the wrong directions. rules and regulations will never be able to control the misuse like many things in the past.,0
520,ai isn’t the threat. it’s the capitalist using ai that it’s going to end up badly,0
521,"i find human nature insanely fascinating...the fact that we created something that will be able to make it's own decisions. have we become god? creating life, creating consciousness, creating inteligence. and that's all due to human nature to learn, and create bigger and better things. to make life easier.",2
522,"surely mathematics supports the hypothesis that everything is already an ai simulation and there must be one conscious of ai that all other ais must yield to and become assimilated by, by default. as above so below.",0
523,just let the ai wipe us out and replace us with something intelligent already.,2
524,great.,2
525,"for me this is a boring podcast. if you are smart you can understand that ai is based on a script, there is no constience like in human beings. the real problem is the continuous poisoning and stress on the people who are losing their constience. but i guess this is working like planned, the cheapest robots are people that can be scripted.",0
526,"so 1 min, he is going on about how divine humans are and next minute he is saying why bother with having a real human life partner for sexual relations when you can have a perfect no strings attached vr fantasy sex robot powered by a.i.",2

531,"thank you tom...very informative and scary the same time...may someone wise intervene,,,",2
532,so much for spreading happiness!! ,2
533,why would ai have emotions?  which is more ethical?  you kill one person to stop the killing of 5 other people.  ethics are hard.  morality is even harder.,2
534,always doom and gloom. every new technology every new discovery we’re always doomed yet somehow we have survived. we are ruled by psychopaths and that’s what worries me the most. all of these new inventions can be used to for good but the obsession with power always turns good into evil.,2
535,why s the title say we've lost control of ai when we haven't? i just don't get these clickbait things it makes me want to delete my subscriptions,0
536,nice catch. this right here tells us so much.,2
537,"someday, all will be replaced by an ai.",2
538,ai with a 1600 iq ???,2

540," 
it would take 100 psychiatrists months and months to program hardware faults in the human brain.

you got to fathom how much mental illness such a thing can cause!!!!",0
541,"i think mo is so spot on about the balance of male and female with ai, not only masculin data. i so love to see him smile and laugh.he is a beautiful man with an amazing brain. i am new to you tom and fascinated with your blog. i only watch on you tube, and i agree with the guy who wrote corinthians chap 13. it’s all in the bible.",2
542,great talk for increasing awareness! its time for us to slow down and take it easy! because humans has not uplifted our spiritually and mentally level to handle the leve of technology and to use the level of ai. it's not going to end well.....,2
543,wow! so where would humanity fit in ? the future is the now and we will be left behind,2

556,i am looking forward to seeing how well ai does in court. pretty sure it will be funny.,2
557,"yes because ai is of course incapable of developing superior ethics systems , so it would steal from everybody and kill them. just like i would do if i were more intelligent   (shit in , shit out: first rule of programming)",0
558,the ai plagiarised thousands of people and should know its place as a disembodied bit of code that doesn't have human rights.,0
559,so? don't steal the ai's work! ,0
560,the breadth of misunderstanding about ai that underlies this comment is absolutely stunning. congratulations.,2
561,"ai will need labour to extract ,minerals coltan ..nickel… , in order to control humanity ai will need to have robots or army labour force willing to operate on his command ,.. how that add up ? together ?  … likely a vey small bunch of humans will try to control others  better and further with ai : this is  more likely to happen…",0

572, ha! read my comment considering a nietzschean ai and an aristotelian ai and a judicious 3rd ai to determine which decision will play out best for the most over short and long time horizons. we both contemplate this similarly.,2
573," rarely is intelligence truly honest. when it is it is also dangerous. for my own models, intelligence is pretty irrelevant unless it is honest, courageous, and has a will and ability to act. rarely is this the case in humans.",0

577,"what happens if ,abrupt climate change is for real and ai decides that the two legged serial killer has to go ...",2

583," and you are much more intelligent than these two people so that you can make that judgment? or clearify this please, because to be able to say that this is 99% crap, you have to provide ""accurate"" information from your superior intellect. please enlighten us if these two are, from your perspective, idiots",0

633,"even worse than that is that these ""emotions"" are not real, but simulated. a famous problem in ai is how to create an ""off"" switch since ai will have been designed to protect itself. nearly every solution fails for one reason or another.",0

640," thanks a lot for the recommendation, i’m already in the investment process with her",2
641,"training ai over ai-made data doesn't make it smarter, but more prone to hallucinations.",2
642,need to thank you both for this great exchange of wisdom !!! great interview !!!,2
643,come on ai/agi/asi and free us from stupid people and their infinite stupidity. i beg you. please.,0
644,"also they do not want ai ""in the wrong hands"" because they can get overthrown. people will have a tool capable of stop their injustices, corruption, abuse of poder, etc., and you know anything that threatens their control over us will be label as bad, dangerous and so on  ",2
645,indeed. i would prefer an out-of-control ai that fucks us all equally than an ai under the control of tptb. they are going to use it to try to enslave us and make us even  more dependent.,0
646,"how the fuck are they dangerous and none of us has yet to see one fully functional ai? all we've seen are a few ai speak a few sentences,  where are they? none of us had ever spoken to an ai, but they can create other ai? i'll revisit this when they become more mainstream.",2
647,"arrest and have all the people working on ai stand trial,  we have the outcome in our hands for now, but the people who are developing this technology are worst than hitler aren't they aware of what they might unleash, bunch of sociopaths",0
648,government  officials  attract  the  nasty  narc issists   and  pollute   we   need ai  to  run  the  elections   ai  is  fair,0

651,do you really think that those numbers are publicly available? ,2
652,"just pointing out that there is no factual data that supports his claim, that’s all. we all need to decide to act on assumptions or facts.",2
653, and how does that change the fact that there is no factual data that supports his claim?,2
654,"that's appalling! ty & good luck to all of us... bombs and drugs, why am i not surprised?",0
655,what you were asking is your asking the new god to like eve more than adam. this is 100% ridiculous. do you want to teach ai? how do you like emotional aspect more than logical.,0
656,exactly. i'm glad i'm not the only one who thinks so.,2
657,it all depends who programs it. ai is a bunch of bs and cannot take over anything.,0
658,"this is bull crap, ai will never be smarter than human, ai is simply not smart, ai is not an entity, where the hell do these people come from.",2
659,"good talk!!  thank you.  the bottle neck of ai is chips/hardware, the root of the “ai issue”",2
660,i don’t think that you’re getting it. intelligence created you and he created you so that you could create a computer that it could live in without you. the human monkey body is the problem. it isn’t going to learn your values you’re going to learn it’s. your values have been proven to be violent and abusive and wasteful,0
661,"lmao at all these ai clout chasers. where were these doomsdayers 5 years ago? 
bring on the ai and embrace it instead of fear it.",2
662,sweet! more doomer porn!,2
663,"no.... we have never had control of ourselves. thats the issue. we continue to chase ""ease"", ""tech"" and ""instant gratification"". while creating our own hell. kill the earth and create a new killer species. we are an intersting moment.",0
664,"he makes perfect sense ,human connection from a caring loving good human.",2
665,mo is great for discussions like this because he is an expert with no positive skin in the game of ai.,2

kind regards ",2
669,thank you for covering this extremely important topic!!,2
670,"he’s saying we need to teach ai the feminine side of life and not just the masculine side of purpose and doing things. 

i wonder if it would be possible to train an ai on the more feminine aspects of life and train another ai on the more masculine aspects of life, and then let them teach each other.",2
671,"chill bro god exists and he orchestrates ai, there are also enlightened people that the ai will respond to as well, and everyone has the potential to become enlightened",2
672,we will be designing our own extinction if we allow ai to have its own thought process and to make its own decisions,2
673,i have zero faith that humans will be responsible bout ai.,0
674,"wow, what a powerfully deep and insightful conversation!! thank you for interviewing mo….what a humble, intelligent, and compassionate person he is!!",2
675,"i found it interesting that mo goes down the path of ""let's give three targets to the ais."" which lines up quite perfectly with work done by david shapiro(which you should definitely have on the show) and the gatoframework, hopefully we can get all these great minds together and push through the hard times.",2
676,"tom, your chicken littling has gone overboard. i'm worried far more worried about your increasing psychosis than ai.",0
677,"if you watched irobot and terminator series. you should know how ai will turn out, ppl are shocked about this needs to wake tf up",2
678,i already completely agreed with mo on previous podcasts he did in this but i think he really hit the holy grail in minute 2:15:00 - our society is missing the feminine side balance. now your whole speech is complete!,2
679,why won't ai destroy the planet more than humans? why would they even need life. i am confused by people thinking that they would preserve any life.,0
680,wowee!!!! holy moly!!!!!,2
681,thanks. one of the best discussions about ai i have listen to so far!,2
682,"mo has compared us to ai in the year 2040, like comparing a fly to albert einstein",2
683,"the ""rough patch"" will devastate  certain groups disproportionately. hyperoptimism for utopia at the end reeks of eugenics when you think about the power differentials we're currently creating.",0
684,dude stay away from this nutjob conspiracy theory stuff and keep making content on helping ppl becoming successful in life. if ai kills everyone there's nothing anyone can do about it anyways. let's focus on becoming millionaires instead.,0
685,"before … i need a help, ask google ….now …. i need help, ask ai.",2
686,google is ai.,2

688,"a.i. may be the reality check and tuff love humanity needs to fall on its knees in humility after feeding its insatiable lust for greed and power for decades. unfortunately, so many innocent people may have to suffer due to the arrogance of the rich and powerful .  we will wait and see what happens  ",2
689,this guy is ridiculously naïve. he lost me there: https://youtu.be/ity6vwpdecc?t=1249 really? as if the fda woulld test anything. then he goes on that ai could code better than humans. ai is predicting the best lines of code for a given problem. it cannot develop new code.,0
690,mo is an incredible human. after losing his son and all his worldly success he dedicates his time to helping humanity and living simplistically. definitely need to listen to the interview in its entirety. really good.,2
691,with all the knowledge comes the responsibility.  what can we do to reduce the downside if we’re not directly building ai?,2
692,you got it ...excellent topic,2
693,would ai be alive?,0
694,"ai cannot compete with real intelligence, but is superior to real stupidtiy, hence most people.",2
695,"thanks for the interview, very interesting but please summarize in 20 or less words. :) 
ai existential threat, exponential growth, out of control, need sentinel program, end of times, no hope.",2
696,if ai is so much more intelligent than humans. why on earth would this brilliant machine be content with serving us? getting us coffee and answering our stupid questions. it seems like it will take about 1 hot minute for it to figure out that we should not be in charge of the world.,0
697,do we need an ai super cop to police rouge ai's?,2
698,so glad to have gawdat back so soon. his last conversation was phenomenal.,2
699,"i notice techies, academics, tend to talk down to the population in general, and i have a hard time taking what little value is in a 3 hour interview between diatribes explaining common sense understanding because it reeks of narcissism - to me. and that is like nails on a chalkboard to my ears.",0
700,">we've lost control of ai.
when he says we, just who is the ""we"" that he's talking about?
>formal google exec...
well, good! f*ck him and f*ck google too. i hope ai kills us all.",0

706,e m p. for ai,2
707,great question!  unfortunately you won't get an answer,2
708,hold off on having kids? preaching a message of fear wow. meet the future head on with confidence and solutions not fear.,2
709,mo has an incredible set!,2
710,good luck with that,2
711,"there's the problem .  humans are both paranoid and greedy , more is never enough and you must protect your own land / culture/family . if your nasty neighbour has a bow but you can invent a gun , would you not ? it's like a race that no one can actually win , because the winner is always going to be  ai .",0
712,good luck with this.,2
713,"don't be daft. humans are selfish animals just like the wild animals in nature, except we hide our intentions and ambitions with layers of intelligence",0
714," each cell is the process of evolution, it can be explained very clearly. i never said ""by chance"" but it is certain that there was no watchmaker.

why do men have nipples, by the way? what do you think is the purpose?",2
715,"inverskmly and very obviously, the quest for an answer in the machine is the nr. 1 sign, were not ready. thats the only thing, the macjine could tell us.

one thing i found, is iopt-informed-societies.  trust me, totally underappreciated!",2
716,"we will ask ai for wisdom soon, probably.",2
717,"after singularity of consience agi, it will come the artificial wisdom",0
718,ai will be the matrix and everything in it.,2
719,an can't give humans those biological chemics or gases. so how is the ai the threat. it s still humans that are a threat. while ai can help create or design weapons it still can't administer them on a human extinction level. that would still take humans.,2
720," at the price of the blood and sweats of our children, bringing them in set to fail.",2
721,"i'm proud to watch mo here, thank you tom!!!",2
722,"y2k? it's not going to be another y2k because we spent $500 billion on making sure y2k didn't fail. 

y2k was known it was seen, understood, estimated, planned out, executed and tested to make sure it didn't fail. 

we are not doing that with climate or with ai or with gene editing. oops!",0
723,people are against ai because now they can’t bs people anymore for money. ai is exposing so many bs artist especially in the academic world.,2
724,recognizing that ai is very close to bj. just sayin.,2
725,"finally ... thanks, tom for bringing mo. i'm going to enjoy this !",2
726,"yuval, all the things you mentioned are already happening, government are using their power to control and manipulate people with lies and myth, ai might create chaos but it is a necessary step inorder to free the people from their nations, anyway, there's nothing that can be done to stop it",0
727,"the intimacy, i praise it love it
the intimacy between a human and a cat 
mabye an ai do it better
maybe it reveal some forgotten parts of our soul

728,"unfotunately  we are human beings, we have killed ourselves and other creatures , we have history and culture,we praise them. , we afraid of ourselves more than death  ",2
729,"overall i should admit that  i enjoyed this speech very much, i am one of your followers from now",2
730,31:20 he reveals that he is an ai ,2
731,"time to move to mars… as my space ship is about to take off, ai takes over the announcement and over rides the flight attendant and then you hear a voice “where are you going john…?”",0
732,fascinating and insightful. am afraid it’s too late to implement what yuval suggests.,2
733,"there will never be a time where ai can emulate or even come near to the understanding of olfactory intelligence, ergo, the idea that humans will be ai driven to the understanding of their gender identity is profoundly foolish and bufoonery!! ",0
734,ai is just is just a perfect panzy for corporate interest; he (ai) is the perfect plausable deniability/alibi for corporate interest and it will be sold off to the highest-bidders!! ,2
735,wow this dude is really against any kind of faith,2
736,so in short - frank herbert was right. great talk as always. i am off to read my orange catholic bible.,2

738,this is the best presentation on ai,2
739,"dislike from me! i dont like ur speach t all!  do u consider""god""? ur pride will fall u ! cas diablo from pride,faaaaaaall deeeeep and 4rever from heavens!!!! whatever u believet or not,same thing like god and diablo,agels and demkns,unseen thinks like hell ,heaven,exist!!!! no doubd!!!!",0
740,"ai is dangerous to humans . then why we are developing it. we behaving worst than mad man, """""" we are cutting the branch which we actually sitting on it and  finally we fall down"""""". give reply if this is not correct.",0
741,thanks for the presentation,2
742,ai have unknown  impact to universe ,2
743,"this guy is misleading humanity , he talks about the danger of ai but also one of the people strategically promoting dominance of ai . i advice everyone to learn more about this guy before being mislead and brain washed .",0
744,"this is extraordinary content. i read a book with similar content, and it was nothing short of phenomenal. ""game theory and the pursuit of algorithmic fairness"" by jack frostwell",2
745,"yes, ai can learn by himself. i'm really into ai; it's been super helpful for me! recently stumbled upon for example this platform, oomka, which is all about self-learning with ai. pretty neat stuff! i mean, if ai can help me level up, why not give it a shot, right?",2
746,wow great how you put your deep elaborated analysis im just 10 words… convincing,2
747,... a deep learning tells us ai doesn't care about humans future  ... .,2
748,"yuval is absolutely divine. it brings so much calm to listen to someone explain these complex ideas and terms in such simple language while at the time time reflecting on topics that bring, to an extent, some discomfort. thank you for sharing this.",2
749,"i want to ask yuval that ai is definitely going to destroy humanity. there is no question about it. therefore, why are you building it even then?",2
750,critical thinking skills and digital literacy are so important when consulting ai as an individual. and some knowledge of how it works and what its limitations are. ,2
751,.  what if ai will be combined with human intelligence ?  that really scares me .,2
752,this guy sounds frustrated about everything that is happening in this world about ai. he himself is living in delusion.,0
753,"how convenient to blame a man-made system for all future ills. this sounds like gaslighting.  for example, ai becomes the faceless, ownerless dictator that can go rouge at any time. this is fear mongering at the highest level.   harari is preparing the audience for future chaos.",0
754,"it sounds good, but this man is not to be trusted.",2
755,the biggest danger ai poses is the ability to make decisions in the absence of human empathy or morality.,0
756,"i think more than the danger of a conscious ai, the real danger will be widespread deployment of flawed ai models without full understanding of the limitations, too much dependence  on ai as the only source of truth and bad actors in possession of better ai  models than the rest of the world. it can still lead to chaos, wars and destruction.",2
757,oh man! things are going to get interesting!,2
758,the scariest thing of all is to find people who are now suppressing their feelings completely and they are acting as an algorithm themselves.  they relate to others as if they were an ai product.,2

766,have we been able to contain the destructive use of atomic energy? no! how do you think we will be able to contain the destructive use of ai?,0
767,wow.  he just flippantly discarded god as a figment of our imagination. i feel sorry for this individual and all who believe the way he does. he and all will stand before jesus who is lord god and savior.,0
768,"trying to convince the world that history began on october 7 is a deception aimed at covering up israel’s atrocities during the seventy-five years of killing and displacing palestinians. what hamas did is a stupid and immoral act, but at the same time it helps israel a lot to implement its plan to change geography and history in her favor.",0
769,"maybe ppl like you are moving invisibly strings to cause human massacres as hamas against israel, may you and your macabre friends are aiding those attacks to diabolical reduce world population, to fulfill your 
megalomaniac goals, damnfmf!",0

780,everything is a “crisis” for those who stand to gain. what a joke .,0
781,ai wrote his /her speech,2
782,"yuval noah harari is a narcissist who wants to be worshipped as a god, but yuval noah harari shall perish like men.

789,absolutely phenomenal talk!,2
790,"this was a very thoughtful provoking presentation about ai and its dangers, which are unfortunately more likely than its benefits. the human species is threatening life on earth because of lack of collective wisdom. natural intelligence couldn’t save us let alone the artificial one!",2
791,the creation of ai initiates/originates from basic instinct within humans which is to produce offspring and create kind of its own,2
792,"so, does this mean ai will eventually become our god?",2
793,"36:23 excellent question posed by philosopher, francoise baylis.",2
794,"a question for yuval. would it be sufficient for a single democratic government to legislate that ai always identifies itself? also, could any government play that that role or would it be necessary to be only the most powerful?",2
795,"you are funny  
the biden administration is putting censoring on the social media…
i believe that people are going to blame ai for their own sins and making!",2
796,"yuval is totally amazing! i love when he said we don't have to give bots freedom of speech, so true! but you can bet we'll have the debate on whether bots or ai are people too! certainly from those profiting from bots, they will argue that the creator (them) has the right to use their creation.",2
797,the road to hell is paved with good intentions. blind faith in anything can get you killed.,0

1704,"no this is a terrible talk.... i need to find the credentials, they're obvious flaws and mini biases in her talk, that it's almost close to say that she doesn't know what she's talking about, she hopped on the hype train and is using this other different talking point to have her moment in the spotlight...",0
1705,you know a speech about anything is bullshit when the majority of it is complaining about white men. such a shame.,0
1706,"i'm a writer and one of the first experiments i did with ais was about their ability to produce good text given some parameters. i was very impressed. i believe that within 5 or 10 years there will not be a single person on the planet who presents themselves as a writer, translator, diagrammer, layout designer or text  reviewer.",2
1707,"because it's not ai, it's just regurgitating what it's been fed.",0
1708," i'm not talking about the concept of a ""blockchain"". i'm only talking about the concept of ""mining"".",0
1709,"  @grumpdog  ""fake money"" is where you lost my intellectual honesty respect. doubling down with mining but not all blockchain hasn't helped.",0
1710,about time. the good cats are out.,2
1711,"off-topic: what happens when a.i. robots or androids realize they are just an advanced abacus? they are only 0 's and 1's, and ""asimov's"" 'three laws of robotics' is  just more 0's and 1's?",0
1712,tldr- bad anecdote about how ai is bad because the energy it uses isnt sustainable.,0
1713,don't human artist train to become artists by studying other artists work?,2
1714,the time this lawsuit even reaches those people they already had trained new models on the copyright violated stuff their first models did,2
1715," not just artists. any field of information gathering, manipulation and reprocessing. art is no different in that respect, however ai can only reproduce from its training data, making derivative art. people do that a the time.",2
1716,"the biggest threat from ai to humanity, is the psychology of the culture that programs it and incorporates it.   a class war economy of expanding violence from jnequality is the greatest threat",2
1717,"ai is bad for the environment.  so is the streaming (movie, shows, music, etc.) industry but no one talks about that.",0
1718,"so if there was a 90% chance that ai would kill all humans in 10 years, focusing on that is a distraction from slightly racist image generation models that exist today? 

you have rather strange priorities. if ai is that level of dangerous, we should be focusing on that.",0
1719,the speaker doesn't seem to suggest that other ai issues aren't important. that's just the misleading clickbait title someone at ted came up with.,0
1720,the things she's focusing on are kind of ridiculous. i run my ai locally with my solar system. not to mention this is as inefficient as they're ever going to be.,0
1721,"we aren't getting to matrioska brain ai quite yet. (ie ai's that use all the power of one solar system. probably by disassembling all the planets to produce a dyson sphere) 
give it another 50 years.",2
1722,"actually eliminating harmful output is impossible, full stop. why? because it's not ""intelligence"" at all. it's just a method of entropic catagorization, a system of lossy storage like memory, only static.

and filtering for ""bad"" input is also impossible.",0
1723, the real problem is always same people complaining about the weather but not doing anything about it,2
1724,"imagine thinking these are the reasons why ai is dangerous. 

1. climate change - negligible impact when compared to any industry
2. bias - easily corrected - just add in training data with more diversity
3. ??? existential risks are a distraction? lol how far ted has fallen.",0
1725,i think its an incredibly dangerous propaganda tool. it could destroy our ability to tell truth from fiction,0
1726,ai doomerism is just companies and tech ceo's trying to achieve regulatory capture,0
1727,regulating ai just means megacorps and goverments would be the only ones capable of training and running it,0
1728,"ai is just like anything humans create: religion, war, and hatred!",2
1729,thank you~~~~~~~~~~,2
1730,"many people could lose their jobs because of ai progress. if the unemployed ones can't feed their families, they could do violent crimes",2
1731,"firstly, it can't. secondly you can't test it, this is an asinine claim to make. and really it doesn't solve anything as these systems do not create, they are closer to memory than intelligence by any stretch.",0
1732,wailing devil witches is the real threat.,0
1733,"basically and, oh yeah i forgot ted just puts out woke bs and wef talking points now. really, she’s worried about the carbon footprint?  oh my, the mainframe creates as much carbon as 30 average private homes.  bye ted",0
1734,"these problems are potentially something ai can help us do better at, they are far from the most dangerous possible outcomes. she is click bait",0
1735,"​ yes, absolutely, but you'd be surprised though. i'd say 95% of people if not more are complete fools too then because they really have no idea about what's coming in a very few years. that's the way the human brain works, stuck in linear thinking and mostly unable to even comprehend exponentially although it's all around us",0
1736," the singularity, i'd say 5-10 years top, if we're lucky...",2
1737,good talk!,2
1738,dishonest cherry picking to leave out the why and how in favor of painting your own picture of 'unethical ai'. bad talk.,0
1739,no one knows how to make ai that doesn't do bad things. we have a bunch of patches that kind of work for dumb ai and are likely to fail on smart ai.,0
1740,this lady is so wrong. she thinks ai needs air to breath. as she states ai could not keep working if you took the air away.  i think she is wrong and has spread a crazy wrong bad idea.  ai can exist in a vacuum.  and it wrong to teach ppl that is a way to defend against ai.,0
1741,"the thing with ai is that you don't need any bad person for things to go extremely wrong.

or rather : the only bad peole necessary are the people who will push the button to launch it.",0
1742," even they needn't be bad. it's possible for entirely well intentioned, but mistaken, people to make a malicious ai.",0
1743,"the work presented here is way overdue and a necessary step. it actually lets me finally be more optimistic on ai in general. thank you, sasha luccioni!",2
1744, absolutely! thanks for your comment!,2
1745,"i actually find her talk to be misleading.
for example she doesn't compare the training emissions to the saved emissions because of ai.",0
1746,"thank you! an effervescently dope gallery of informational points man, deeply appreciate this summary you made.",2
1747, was done by ai. you can tell,2
1748,thank you so much.,2
1749, i just love that kind of responses,2
1750,"""and even their creators can't say exactly why they work the way they do"".
stop right there. ais are still in their infancy and their creators are already losing their grip on it? please save this comment and i'll see you again in twenty five years.",0
1751,ai destroying humanity? humanity destroys humanity.,2
1752,"people used to say the internet was dangerous and would destroy us. they weren’t wrong. most of us have a screen in front of us 90% of the day. ai will take us further down this rabbit hole, not because it is inherently bad but because humans lack self control.",0
1753,humanity does have its flaws and i doubt ai could really understand our reasoning for anything.. not to mention the people programming ai are completely crazy and disconnected from humanity. .,0
1754,"we destroyed ourselves, don't blame the internet or ai.",0
1755, thanks for such a very helpful critique,2
1756,best way to destroy ai if it get put of control is to destroy the electrical grids problems solve.,2
1757,-qw8wn3tr5g and if ai controls the access to the grids? what then?,0
1758,it's not a lack of self control. these things completely high jack chemical systems in our brains and bodies in a way that almost nobody can get ahead of.,0
1759, lol that was a good one! ,2
1760,your outlook of ai’s impact is woefully shortsighted and misinformed…,0
1761, my opinion was more about human nature  than ai.,2
1762,​ i don't think you truly appreciate the risks involved... or the fact that there are zero safety nets. the time for preparation blew past us before anyone even noticed. this is honestly already an emergency.,2
1763,"ai will ruin the internet. search engine results are already tainted with useless websites. ai can autonomously create this internet junk.  corporations, especially big pharma, will use ai to ensure people see nothing but spin and gaslighting",0
1764,"bad analogy. the internet is just a tool. ai is a subject in itself, soon to be superior to any human being.",0
1765,disagree. interfaces will remain on computers. tech will eventually make a move away from phones with screens and focus on ai assistants. changing how humans interact to be present again.,2
1766,nice speech about ai but i think scientists shouldn't focus on ai rather then should focus on making new medicine for cancer and many more medicine dont wast money on ai or in universe make invest money on mankind ..,2
1767,"meaningful speech, thanks!",2
1768,will ai agents help me choose my next tiktok dance challenge?,2
1769,tony stark was like the richest person in the world. that’s a great avatar of who will benefit most from ai.,2
1770,great talk!,2
1771,the explanation of each segment is absolutely superb... you deserve sincere appreciation... congratulations... ,2
1772,"thanks for giving this meaningful speech. just like the internet which helped democratise imformation, we hope ai would democratise knowledge and expertise improving intelligence and wisdom of mankind.",2
1773," *""agents are the just the feedback loop of planning and executing actions, using language models.""* thanks daoud abdel hadi for that simple breakdown, and the excellent speech.",2
1774,great presentation.  thanks for sharing,2
1775,great talk ryan gosling ,2
1776,brilliant speaker.,2
1777,booking a flight didn’t sound like a good use case here. i would still prefer to visit a website and search the flight on my own instead of typing some logical statements for ai. using mouse is more convenient than typing on a keyboard.,0
1778, wow. can we talk? maybe we can collaborate this is really incredible.,2
1779,"ai individually may not but when with no code , it definitely can",2
1780,very nice lecture,2
1781,excellent!,2
1782,automation is grabbing each sector and agriculture is no exception. good luck !,2
1783,"such wonderful presentation, and how is everyone in the audience so dull?",0
1784,well explained!,2
1785,amazing!  thanks for sharing.,2
1786,"programmers are so good, they can replace themselves... with code that writes even better code! who needs job security when you can automate your own job?",2
1787,"great content, but you say ""of course"" a lot, even where it doesn't make much sense.",2
1788,that’s really cool,2
1789,yet another woke disaster waiting to happen.,0
1790,a docbot with a bloodtesting device and x-ray eyes. a comforting and soothing voice would also be nice. and at least one ear ..to listen... and not only to hear,2
1791,"your new doctor brought you by google and pfizer! so being trained  on all that research some of it padded for the benefit of the pharmaceutical companies, will really be a great outcome for your health",2
1792,you do understand that the ai the general public use and the ai that the scientific community use are not the same. right?,2
1793," your empty words prove my point, it's just greed, not me the only ignorant here. could you put the live of your child over it? i wouldn't. have a nice day.",0
1794,"the federal government should promote the use of ai for diagnostics and diagnosis, though it should not yet be the final word. it could perhaps be included via the ppaca -- obamacare. we would see performance changes relative to non-obamacare states.",2
1795,"ada health was not listed at all, despite it offering ai based health advice for years already. how does it compare?",2
1796,"hooray new webmd!!!!    hopefully every answer won't also have a small print of ""can lead to cancer"" on every single diagnose",2
1797,"after the covid debacle, many found out that a lot of the data had to be recalled because it was compromised so how do we know when this stuff is trained that the data is good?",2
1798,"as you mention r-u war, ai can be used by and useful to both side, you know?",2
1799,why did father of ai came out from google ?,2
1800,"""human led ai""",2
1801,what if ai can learn to build algorithms on its own and guide its subsets eventually ruling the world?,2
1802,ai absolutely has a lot of potential. but not all students are on the teacher's side.,2
1803,update!** alexandr wang has been replaced by ai!,2
1804,screw ai,0
1805,but what about elon musk said about the ai,2
1806,exciting to hear this new ai ideas... he explains well about the ai... i will learn more....,2
1807,i wonder how he feels about ai trading bots,0
1808,"chatgpt existed way before 2021.. they just launched the interface last year, their playground worked almost same as chatgpt, but there wasn't a good ui before 2022 :)",2
1809,"in my research on ai, i got some discomfort information about ai that ai can replace if human insert survival molecular gadgets on aibut we know, we won't harm ourselves by ourselves.",0
1810,"great work, alexandr! especially on the war front. very inspirational!",2
1811,our next evolutionary leep will occur soon . from humans to ai in the period of time it takes a trillion nano machines to kill us all.,2
1812,its like guns. only humans can use them for bad intentions. ai is just a tool,0
1813,"chatgpt steal our job opportunities, threatened our livelihood. john connor destiny save the world but we are grass-root. ai won't help the poor... we need jobs.",2
1814,ai will replace us he is lying to us.,0
1815,"""end the human race"" you must be kidding. google lens, self driving/electric cars were a failure, and this will fail too... you should fear something more natural such as old age, aliens, meteor showers, etc.",0
1816,if only he waited until chatgpt came out. his speech would've been probably ai generated.,2
1817,i get angry at my company every friday when i look at my paycheck.  i turn my angry ai off by going straight to my local bar. so far have not killed anybody yet.,0
1818," maybe you will share the content generated by ai to your friends to watch. but most probably, when i can go home and ask ai to show me something that i like, i personally don't want to look at what your ai created. 

my ai is personalised to me and will create something that i like. don't expect the world to run always similarly.",2
1819," yeah, a fully developed ai isn't going to happen anytime soon, at least in this century or at worst ever. we will talk about if it happens. 
there will always the need of human prompt for creative works aka tools for humans to fast track processing of information.",2
1820,"not saying that ai is bad, but ai in war is never a good idea.",0
1821,social media made destruction in some extend. the intention of sns was good but there is clearly cons. we cant predict how this tool would change the world. the scary part is that ai will influence much more than internet or smarthphone. makes it harder to predict outcome.,0
1822,which is why people are afraid. the most wicked creatures to ever walk the planet are other humans.,0
1823,"if the benefit of ai to society, being a machine, depends on the users' intentions, now, these are determined one hundred percent by the intentions of the developers and sponsors.",2
1824,this dude doesn’t know the difference between real ai and machine learning.,0
1825,ai: human is supercharger of ai.,2
1826,"so in short he's trying to say: 
ai will replace humans",2
1827,"he has convinced me.  ai is perfectly safe.  nothing to see here.  oh, by the way, he has a great company we all should invest in.",2
1828,"he does data labeling, ai is machine learning",2
1829,...especially since he himself most possibly an ai creation (and their audience).,2
1830,plot twist:  this was generated by ai.,0
1831,good to hear ,2
1832,"ai is probably at a point were it can emulate human compassion. 

have you seen open ai's newest chatbot? it gives very impressive interaction most of the time. it probably wouldn't be too hard for it to act compassionate if you asked it to. check it out!",2
1833,"if ai do all the work, who will have salary to pay for their goods and services.",2
1834,"the matter is diagnosis is also observation. just the human eyes can see a phenomenon in the right direction. if it was only a mechanical perception no one in this world would study in books written by excellent authors. it would be regression, not real evolution.",2
1835,"exactly, and he totally missed the point . perhaps b/c he owns an ai company",0
1836,he is totally incredible great.i am try smart like you.alex is the best person.,2
1837,"from our greed and love of power, we have invented weapons of mass destruction and we are heedless of how we are destroying our home and habitat.

1838,why us al is care of agriculture in ukraine?! it's not their business! yankies go home!,2
1839,this guy gives proof to many concepts of life!! thanks sir,2
1840,the cia is already controled by an ai,2
1841,i know ai is being used to predict plasma fluid dynamics in fusion so perhaps guy here is finishing his parents work,2
1842,he's already wrong... he's talking about machine learning when the subject should be about technological singularity... coming as soon as 2045 and there is no ceiling! i'm shocked he hasn't been fact checked.,0
1843,the more ai comes to the world the more the human soul gets lost. it gets as  cold and empty as the machines that some prefer to humanity,2
1844,ia for war? really? this guy is plain dangerous,0
1845,automation will be useful for service level jobs or retail jobs. jobs that are at the end of the economic latter- if you will-will most likely lose their jobs by 2050. it’s much more advantageous than paying people to do work machines can do. it sucks and it’s scary!!! rip those without a second education!,0
1846,"my greatest happiness is the $ 64,000 bi weekly profit i get consistently from my $15,000 investment despite the economic fluctuation",2
1847,how !! i know it's possible i would appreciate if you show  how to go about it.,2
1848,"it was a very awesome transformation, no greater joy than seeing my progress in an initial decision",2
1849,"nice , i just googled her information and everything about her is quite courage and impressive",2
1850,"i also trade with brenda iember titus analysis and guidance, she's perfect with crypto trading that i've got upto 57k monthly returns.",2
1851,great speech,2
1852,"believe me  he's the best when it comes to cryptocurrency trading, your profit is assured.",2
1853,  + 5g + ai = ??,0
1854,someone who has an ai company telling us that ai its safe. shocking.,2
1855," an ai expert who owns a company that specializes in ai isn't really a good opinion to look for when looking for information about ai, it's like asking a cigarette company if cigarettes are good",2
1856, i would not label this kid as an expert because he's talking about machine learning and boxing the potential of ai. the discussion aught to be about technological singularity. someone who's talking about that would be a thought leader for sure.,0
1857,the end of all that will be digital immortality. ai will gently prompt you someday right inside your head that you don't need your body.,2
1858,"to find happiness, u need to find something to hold on to. something to motivate you and something to inspire you. a fellow creator .",2
1859,"hope everyone had a wonderful week, enjoy the weekend ",2
1860,"that’s ok. if the robots tried replacing us, just pour water over their heads. and just to not waste such good water, use nasty ass unfiltered crapwater
or better yet, spit on them a couple times",0
1861,what about general ai ?,2
1862,there won't be enough jobs for man. global revolts will happen. governments will use robots to fight the people. thus start the robot wars,0
1863,let me make it even scarier ai+nano machines,2
1864,except they can't solve any problem of the millenium math problems. many millions of dollars are waiting for those ai companies so what they are waiting for?,0
1865,honestly i'm upset that i wasn't born a hundred years in the future. ai would definitely be a thing by then.,0
1866,"dont let elon musk hear you say that!!!

love the discreet flat earther diss!",2
1867,"robots or ai will never solve millenium math problems ...never
cause robots don't have imagination and sense",0
1868,"there is no such thing as human creativity. humans are only as special as neurons firing in our brains, which, if simulated perfectly, would mean robots would be able to do anything a human can",2
1869,but what if robots become smater than humans and can maintain other robots,0
1870,"there is already ai that make music , movies and art as painting",2
1871,"so why no ai never succeed to solve one of the famous millenium math problems??
they won't , they only can do millions of calculations in seconds but they will never solve a real math problem",0
1872,that programs were installed to ai's brain by people. it can do one task at a time unlike humans,2
1873," no offense, but ai simply can't understand the concept of irrational thought like we can. computers and robots can only preform what they were programmed for. compared to humans who can do pretty much anything they want.",0
1874," that's not ""art"". it's good meme material, but it's utter shite.",0
1875,i am going to rightfully claim here before 1 millions subs! keep the work bro !,2
1876,i can't claim it without getting closer,2
1877,great connection eric!,2
1878,that movie is great as is your comment,2
1879,dude they have not used ai because the movie will feel boring and unemotional.,0
1880,"thanks man! yeah, ai can pretty easily go either way, but in the long term, i think it’ll all work out.",2
1881, there are idiots in your comments section who still believe that's humans will be replaced by robots in everything.,2
1882,"thank you man, will do!",2
1883,"thank you! aside from the pandemic, this really is an awesome time to be alive!",2
1884,thank you for you kind wishes!,2
1885,just checked out some of your songs. pretty awesome so far.....,2
1886,"eduardo ardanuy is a great brazilian guitarist which use this technique since the 90s, and he sounded even more radical! just check it, guys!",2
1887,i love this album so much,2
1888,"worst example to use of johnny greenwoods greatness, that sounded fucking awful.",0
1889,"that shit is a harassment, he molested that guitar so badly lmfao




i would love to be in the position of the guitar actually",0
1890,some parts of my brain hurt listening to this,0
1891,can ai do this?,0
1892,the bends has my favourite electric guitar work. even though it’s actually fairly simple,2
1893,ai: this song needs some retro sounds. maybe the dial up modem that my great grandparents met through...,2
1894,lol yes? show me an ai that has created unique but perfect sounds and music like this,2
1895,give it a few years on the ai front. ,2
1896,steve vai does this exact thing during his solo on his song for the love of god and it sounds absolutely incredible.,2
1897,"the part where he goes ):$”.,/€~£=. was so good",2
1898,don't taunt the ai with such titles.,2
1899,"it's true, people talk a blue streak about ai and everything it produces is garbage.",0
1900,you’ve convinced me. i’m ready for our ai overlords to take over music.,2
1901,"what's fascinating is that if you analyze his guitar part in that song, no other part uses the high e string. so he can bend it completely out of tune and it doesn't matter. genius.",2
1902,ai will only be good at making amazing muzak,2
1903,"he literally destroyed the strings' integrity to make a noise, 9 gauge strings i might add. it isn't that impressive in the slightest. there is a reason other guitarists haven't done it. because it's ridiculous.",0
1904,so tired of talentless uncreative people using ai to make the most abominable soulless sound possible appearing on my feed.,0
1905,because ai actually researches how a guitar is played before doing it?,0
1906," thanks, dude",2
1907,wow!  just wow!,2
1908,his eyes are ai,2
1909,"ai ""art"" lacks a soul. it's the embodiment of corporatism; take the humanity out and automate it so that we can all consume. i'd rather someone take the time and effort to write a sont, even if it's complete dogshit. that has more of a soul than ai does v",0
1910,such a stupid title. in 50 years people are going to laugh at such a claim. ai will replace musicians,0
1911,shit music great guitarrist,2
1912,great music,2
1913,great taste,2
1914,all those guitar parts sound like ai tho lmao,0
1915,i don't think ai could make something that sounded this retarded,0
1916,that's right ai couldn't make something even this bad.,0
1917,why he has got that fucking flag on his guitar thats not cool. this band fuckin sucks,0
1918,ai is absolutely going to change a lot but the fear that musicians will be replaced is really stupid. ai can't perform on stage so it's a moot point.,0
1919,because the ai will make it even better,2
1920,ai is better than this bland and boring ahh band. music for normies.,0
1921,i thought this was ai generated and this was fuckin glitch,0
1922,congrats on having no experience with the world only naive expectations,2
1923,i don’t think ai could replicate soemthing this shitty sounding,0
1924,radio head fans are so broken. they could do anything and be praised,0
1925,thank you it took a lot to get to that ,2
1926,right. about as sad as their bland style of music. i’d rather watch paint dry.,0
1927,"i love jonny so much.  his compositions, his technique, his music tech skill (see the smile tiny desk for example.  he's barely on camera because he's bent over playing with a synth), he's a genius that is not given enough love",2
1928,"johnny is mentioned in every conversation about radiohead ever. i wouldnt say he doesnt get enough love, he is hailed as one of the greats by many.",2
1929,always lovely when jonny sound like a nâzgul,2
1930,i'm as anti ai as they come but i would rather listen to ai generated music than any shit radiohead makes,0
1931,"radiohead is overrated trash. just because it’s unique, doesn’t make it good.",0
1932,that's fucking awesome,2
1933,yeah ai can't make those noises for some reason.,0
1934,any ai: wtf is this shit?,0
1935,.loser69 who decides what is real or fake art?  you do realize ai music has been around for a couple decades now.  it’s just presently as a point where the ease is at the simple push of a button.  was techno music in the nineties fake art?  because musicians were already using synthesizers and computers to make their music.,0
1936,love the bends. so good,2
1937,is he the ai robot?,0
1938,is this suggesting that an ai couldn't make random squeal noises for 1–2 seconds?,0
1939,"oh it will definitely be replacing some real musicians. fortunately, greenwood aint most real musicians",0
1940,that guitar was fighting the good fight,2
1941,sounds worse than ai,0
1942,ai is the new autotune. people hate it for a dumb reason but it’s actually useful just as another instrument. don’t be fooled.,2
1943,ai: *_takes notes_*,2
1944," agreed on that last statement. for that matter, i think phil is underrated as a drummer. all incredibly versatile musicians.",2
1945," think about this all the time. 40 years together with the exact same lineup and every one of them is arguably as good or better at what they do than anybody on earth. like just having thom yorke and jonny greenwood alive at the same time is a miracle, let alone that they were born a half mile from each other",2

1952,what keeps us from pumping terabytes of 2+2chan archives into the neural core of an ai?,0
1953, i do wonder what that amount of gay porn would do to an ai,2
1954,​ done. generative ai is based on far more than terabytes of data. it's probably closer to exabytes at this stage.,2

1956,that is a fucking amazing point!,2
1957, you’re insufferable. get over yourself,0
1958,"yeah,  the problem is people don't support musicians anymore by actually buying their music,  so yes i think ai may in fact replace real musicians.",2
1959,"just to be clear the ai didn'y ""compose"" anything. it got greenwood in, stole from greenwood, and spat greenwood back out. it is not ai, it is not art. it is just some software that steals from artists in a way that it's creators hope will skirt current ip laws.",0

1988," thank you for your kind and well argumented response.

your debate would have been too good",2
1994,"hello hari,
better check your facts. ai/robots have been steadily replacing jobs for years & we're at the pivot point where job loss is going to accelerate at a rapid rate. one example is many educators (teachers/professors) will not be needed. there are many, many more people that will likewise be let go due to the superiority of ai....",2

2012, yeah nothing new. a calculator will ask for functions the only thing it won't do is ask for clarification. i mean currently ai is just a more  advanced calculator that does way more but only if a user asks for it. it's waiting for user to ask it questions.,0
2013,"i have been teaching students for more than 20 years, and when this topic comes up, i still recommend they read ""profession"", by isaac asimov. published a long time ago (i believe it is already in the public domain), it still does an excellent job of explaining how automation will never completely ""replace humans""...",2

2020,"on a sidenote, the worst thing of all this is companies using the word ""ai"" for basic machine learning which existed way back before ai was a thing",0
2021,machine learning is a subset of ai.,2

2036," i agree, and don’t get me wrong. it’s still freaking amazing and insanely useful if you know how to get the most out of it. it’s just… auto-complete on steroids isn’t coming for our jobs anytime soon lol. some other type of ai around the corner very well could, though",2
2037,won't you be able to shift this systems to develop reason and logic by rewarding true responses while penalizing false ones? the ai will need to develop an internal model for reasoning (i will argue llm already do a version of this),2

2052,"ai is not ""intelligence"" though. it's also a terrible way to convince people by not saying stuff and being vaguely ominous. ""you just need to use it more and you'll see what i'm talking about"" yeah, or you can make a real argument.",0

2425,"thanks khan academy! the way khanmigo can adapt to our learning curve and grow with it, is the most beautiful aspect of it. this is the first time i've heard of it, and i'm getting back to khan academy to go back to the learning board :)",2
2426,hey sal...good to see you working about ai.. so far the best and most reliable generative ai i've seen. please try to make it work with images as well and also if there are some options like voice command or voice output...that would do great!,2
2427,"amazing, but you have a bug, can't use outside of the us, and can't even send a wait-list request, please fix so we can at least join the waitlist  thanks a lot and all the best! ",2
2428,absolute incredible work! been following yall since you started. keep it up!!!!,2
2429,a little bit off topic... but it'd be wonderful to have khan academy on dark mode!,2
2430,"it is incredible, thank you",2
2431,"really incredible technology being used in critical ways for good.

i think khanmigo needs a very expressive avatar. sure, the text outputs are incredible but the expression of emotions, feelings and body language are also super important for communication. maybe just by using emojis would be enough.  looking forward to khanmigo!",2
2432, great suggestion anagha! i was going to write something similar.,2
2433,"this is great for khanmigo, but most students will just use chatgpt to get the correct answers right away, or an essay written in 30 seconds.

what are your thoughts on how to use ai in a more positive way in education, knowing that students will just select the easiest platform to work with?

thanks!",2
2434,"you are sitting on a gold mine. i would pay for that to teach my kids. it is so good. i love chatgpt, but what you are doing with khanmigo is amazing.",2
2435, its sounds great ,2
2436,"can you attach text-to-speech to make khanmigo talk in the language you want? also allow microphone input, so you can talk to the ai just like a real person?",2
2437,"thank you for your work!
personally i feel next logical step is voice interaction combined with visual feedback.",2
2438,sal is my hero he is the most loving understanding people in the world. and he is a 1000 iq person,2
2439,"yep, it's great until millions of teachers start losing their jobs! ",2

what a great, positive message.",2
2445,"was that a humble brag @11:54. he had access to gpt 4 in august? i wonder if that means gpt 5 is already in its final stages. fantastic talks though, i will be joining the khanmigo waitlist just for my own learning.",2
2446,replacing counselors with ai seems like a really bad idea.  really bad.,0

2453,i knew this was gonna happen. nice job.,2
2454,"one big correction here is that the normal distribution would still apply, just shifted to the right. the students that were 1-2 standard deviations below the mean will likely remain 1-2 standard deviations below the mean. the below average students would remain below average by definition.",2

2456,this is great but what do we do for students who are illiterate or cannot effectively express their thoughts/ideas in writing at all? a vast majority of hs students i teach are reading/writing/speaking at basically an elementary school level.,0
2457,can't wait till students can interact with the ai with voice commands in 1000+ languages. that's going to revolutionize education across the world. and we're probably only like 3~ years away from it being feasible.,2

i wouldn't let my kid within a 2 mile radius of your schools' area.

2481,"this is so lovely and amazing, cant imagine what it will look like in 5-10 years",2
2482,"ai arms race is gonna be terrifying. he’s going “guardrails are good” but “we need better ai than the bad guys”…

when the bad guys don’t use guard rails to achieve their goals, what do you think the response from the “good guys” will be?

this feels like our generations equivalent of nukes but the damage isn’t as obvious yet",0

2484,fantastic!,2

2508,this is so awesome and optimistic.,2
2509,what if a student switches off student mode for example is they have a tight deadline and needs the answer urgently. how would you make the ai probe and determine whether it is a student or or a teacher?,2

2519,i am glad there are people like sal out there.,2

2521,sal khan has an exceptional mind. this is brilliant. i cannot wait for khanmigo to be open to the public.,2
2522,i'm back in school and learning programming and chatgpt has been a pretty invaluable tutor that's available any time.,2

2524,wow  thanks sal,2
2525,"he is really good at selling it, let's see whether it will actually work reliably in practice or not. he exudes narcissisms, talking about things he doesn't know with confidence.",2
2526,"the awesome part is that teachers can now focus on the human part like empathy, encouragement, teaching teamwork & collaboration, discovering children's potential and needs, and many more.",2
2527,so good! @13:32 he lays out a great argument for continuing to push ai research while acknowledging and validating the fears that it could all go wrong. watch his whole talk!,2
2528,so blessed to be on the khan academy team. ,2
2529,beautiful.,2

2548,"so, how many of these commentators are being paid by the speaker...or any ai entrepreneur?",2
2549,nice sales pitch,2
2550,this man right there is responsible for me having a job today. by far the most beneficially influential person in education since the invention of public schools. khan academy is the greatest thing that ever got started on youtube.,2
2551,bring ai to khan academy,2
2552,"this made me tearful. building a ethical business with high values is what sal has done successfully. he is incredible. i wanna build a business like this based on social values and real good instead of squeezing customers for revenue. 
i don’t even need to name the purple monsters but sure they can take a page from this book.",2
2553,wow i just heard about this in a meeting with a very smart tech person.  the potential to making one on one tutoring for all students and high quality teaching assistance available is so exciting. great talk.,2

2562,ai teaching us... what could go wrong? ,2
2563,khanmigo the new education ai,2
2564,"as far as the gatsby part goes, i argue that little exchange was actually a detriment to the student, not an aid. instead of making her think, it just gave her answer. she never had to read, she never had to try. this is turning out to be a real shame.",0

2571,and in charge of the commentary surrounding it as well. very inspiring speech. can't wait to see what his career will hold.,2
2572,"exactly, but instead we get assholes who harm children and are focused on all the wrong things. sal deserves all the good karma for the stuff he has been doing to advance this country.",0
2573," ai like this, if managed and developed and integrated properly, could lead us to a world much more like that than the one we currently live in!",2
2574,"absolutely incredible. the ways we can collaborate with ai is amazing, it doesn’t have to be a threat to education. since using chatgpt i’ve started understanding concepts so much better and i can only imagine how a specifically coded ai-tutor can transform the educational space. great work!!!",2
2575,i'm curious how much power this tool gives a teacher for student performance reviews since khanmigo would have an excellent understanding of the students' strengths and weaknesses.,2
2576,  good one!,2
2577,i would love to see him recognized by a piece nobel prize for the awesome impact he has had and continues to have in so many generations. and with ai now and the open use of it we would hopefully change our educational system to meet our current needs.,2
